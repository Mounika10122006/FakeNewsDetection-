"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Interpol voted on Wednesday to admit the State of Palestine as a member over Israeli objections at the international police organization s general assembly in Beijing. The decision came despite Israeli efforts to delay a vote and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the Palestinians  joining the global police agency contravened signed agreements with Israel. Israel had argued that Palestine is not a state and that it  is ineligible to join. Under interim Israeli-Palestinian peace deals, a Palestinian Authority was granted limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Shortly before the vote in the Chinese capital, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said Israel s efforts to delay the ballot until next year had failed.   This victory was made possible because of the principled position of the majority of Interpol members,  Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said in a statement. Interpol said membership applications by the State of Palestine and the Solomon Islands were approved at its annual general assembly by more than the required two-thirds majority of votes. The organization now has 192 members. A Palestinian bid to join last year, at an Interpol conference in Indonesia, was foiled by what Israel said was its diplomatic campaign against it. In 2012, the U.N. General Assembly upgraded the Palestinian Authority s observer status at the United Nations to  non-member state  from  entity , like the Vatican. The step fell short of full U.N. membership, but it had important legal implications in enabling the Palestinians to join the International Criminal Court and other world bodies.    Netanyahu s statement said Palestinian membership of Interpol was one of the issues discussed during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump s Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, who is visiting the region.   Netanyahu also raised the Palestinian refusal to condemn an attack on Tuesday in which a Palestinian laborer shot dead three Israeli guards in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.  The actions of the Palestinian leadership in the past few days directly harm the prospects of achieving peace and the Palestinian diplomatic offensive will not go unanswered,  the statement said. Some Israeli media commentators have voiced concern that as an Interpol member, Palestine could ask the organization to issue a  Red Notice , an alert to police worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest an individual, pending extradition. But the procedure does not appear to pose serious legal problems for Israelis such as government officials and military officers whom pro-Palestinian groups have sought to have arrested by local authorities as suspected war criminals during overseas visits. A red notice is not an international arrest warrant, and on its website Interpol notes that it cannot compel any member country to detain an individual named in one. ",1
"RIMINI, Italy (Reuters) - The new leader of Italy s anti-establishment 5-Star movement says it is not a populist party and will make cutting waste and reducing debt its priority. 5-Star, which leads most opinion polls ahead of national elections due early next year, has been trying to shed its maverick, populist image and reassure foreign capitals that it can be trusted with power. Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old lawmaker picked on Saturday to lead the movement, told Reuters on Sunday that 5-Star stood for  post ideological  common sense, and was opposed to right-wing and left-wing extremism.  I reject populism as a label for 5-Star,  he said in an interview on the sidelines of the party s annual gathering in Rimini, on the Adriatic coast. 5-Star, founded by comedian Beppe Grillo nine years ago as a protest movement, bases its appeal mainly on opposition to corruption and vested interests. Boyish-looking and usually immaculately turned out in suit and tie, Di Maio presents a more moderate image than Grillo, who is famous for raucous tirades against the ruling elite. He had been groomed for the leadership by Grillo, who is 69 and now plans to withdraw gradually from his figurehead role. Di Maio said many of the party s proposals, such as a public bank to fund investments, had been adopted with success by mainstream parties in Northern Europe which he wanted to emulate. He said that, if 5-Star won next year s election, due by May, he would try to negotiate changes to European Union fiscal rules to allow Italy to invest more to boost its stagnant economy. However, he said he would also cut waste, arguing that this was the best way to bring down Italy s huge public debt, forecast to be just under 132 percent of GDP this year, the highest in the euro zone after Greece s.  We have brought down debt in every town and city where 5-Star governs. We will do that at the national level too,  he said. 5-Star has rowed back from a pledge to hold a referendum on Italy s membership of the euro and now says this would only be a last resort if the EU rejects any reforms to current budget rules. Di Maio, who comes from Italy s poor south and entered parliament at 26 five years ago, after mostly doing odd jobs and internet marketing, dismissed the suggestion that he was too inexperienced to be prime minister.  I came from a part of Italy with 60 percent youth unemployment, and people who sneer at my background are sneering at thousands of young Italians who are trying to create a future for themselves,  he said. The ability to build a competent team was the most important quality for a prime minister, Di Maio said, vowing to present a full cabinet line-up before the election. Asked to name three priorities that would mark his leadership of the party, Di Maio listed universal income support for the poor, cutting wasteful public spending and increasing forms of direct democracy.

"FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told residents of Flint, Michigan, on Thursday their “horrific” water contamination crisis should be a wake-up call about the country’s crumbling infrastructure and required an emergency response. “If there is any silver lining out of this tragedy, it is my hope that the American people will look at Flint and say, ‘never again,’” Sanders said on his first campaign visit to the city, where a cost-saving decision to switch the water supply has led to a public health crisis from lead contamination. “We are looking at children being poisoned - if that is not an emergency, I just don’t know what an emergency is,” Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, told about 300 people jammed into a Flint church for a meeting that at times featured a freewheeling exchange with shouting residents. Sanders, who has made his call for a $1 trillion investment in U.S. infrastructure a key part of his campaign agenda, said Flint’s water crisis illustrated the need for a long-term commitment to rebuilding dilapidated water systems across the country. “While Flint may be the canary in the coal mine, there are a lot of other canaries all around the country. The truth is our infrastructure is collapsing,” Sanders said. “I hope that out of the tragedy will come fundamental changes.” Sanders’ Democratic campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, visited the predominantly black city weeks ago and frequently highlights the crisis as an example of racial inequity as the two candidates vie for African-American support. Sanders has called for the resignation of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, and met recently with some Flint activists during a visit to Michigan. He told the Flint crowd that hearing their stories of suffering was “horrific.” “Clearly this is part of a long-term trend of starving communities of color,” he said. The crisis was triggered when a city manager installed by Snyder switched the city’s water supply from Lake Michigan to the nearby Flint River. The change corroded Flint’s aging pipes and released lead and other toxins into the water supply. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint in January, authorizing federal emergency management officials to coordinate relief efforts. Lawmakers in Congress have wrestled with the size of a federal funding package to replace aging pipes. Sanders and Clinton will return to Flint on March 6 for their next nationally televised debate ahead of the Michigan primary on March 8.

"You can believe that if this incident with Iran kidnapping our sailors had happened under a Republican president, you would be hearing 24/7 about this. I digress, this wouldn t have happened if we had a president who had the least bit of a backbone. The entire incident is simply unbelievable! Here s a little background into the female sailor who is seen in the photos wearing a headscarf:This photograph violates international law. Article 13 of the Geneva Convention (III), governing the treatment of prisoners of war, requires Iran to protect prisoners against  insults and public curiosity. This photograph   including a female sailor apparently forced to wear a headscarf   is a quintessential example of  public curiosity  and would be interpreted as insulting throughout the Muslim world. (And if you don t think Iran is in a state of armed conflict against the United States, tell that to the families of hundreds of American soldiers who ve lost their lives to Iranians and Iranian-backed terrorists.)Female Sailor in the corner in this picture:The sight of members of the American military, disarmed and under Iranian control, is of enormous propaganda value in Iran s ongoing war against the United States. To its allies in the Middle East, the photo demonstrates Iran s strength   how many jihadist countries have had this many American servicemembers under their power?   and it demonstrates American weakness.Then there s this:  This time, the Americans were cooperative in proving their innocence, and they quickly accepted their faults without resistance,  the analyst, Hamidreza Taraghi, said in a phone interview. The Marines apologized for having strayed into Iranian waters. Never fear, John Kerry made friends with the Iranians, and that made all the difference: Also playing a role was the strong relationship that has developed between Mr. Kerry and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, during negotiations on the nuclear deal, Mr. Taraghi said.John Kerry and Zarif were on the phone during the past hours, and this helped the problem to be resolved quickly due to their direct contact,  he said.Nations that take illegal propaganda photos, crow about their seizure of American boats, confiscate part of their equipment, and then point to our allegedly admitted faults aren t  easing tensions,  they re flexing their muscles. I m glad our sailors and boats are back in American hands   minus, apparently, their GPS equipment   but once again Iran has thumbed its nose at the U.S., demonstrating that it does what it wants   whether it s testing missiles, launching rockets near U.S. warships, or taking, questioning, and photographing American sailors who (allegedly) stray into Iranian waters.Read more at: National Review",0
"Mental health professionals will now be allowed to openly diagnose Donald Trump.For the first time since 1973, a rule that prevents mental health professionals from publicly giving their expert opinion on the mental health of a public figure will no longer be enforced by the American Psychoanalytical Association.The rule was put in place after Barry Goldwater sued Fact Magazine for publishing a poll in which a majority of psychiatrists declared him mentally unfit to be president. Goldwater would go on to lose the presidential election of 1964.But ever since Trump declared his candidacy and began saying and doing insane things in public, many psychiatrists have openly defied the rule in order to inform Americans on his mental state.Fox News pundit Charles Krauthammer, who is also a board-certified psychiatrist, wrote a brutal diagnose of Trump s mental health last August. Trump s hypersensitivity and unedited, untempered Pavlovian responses are, shall we say, unusual in both ferocity and predictability. This is beyond narcissism. I used to think Trump was an 11-year-old, an undeveloped schoolyard bully. I was off by about 10 years. His needs are more primitive, an infantile hunger for approval and praise, a craving that can never be satisfied. He lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value   indeed exists   only insofar as it sustains and inflates him. In addition, Dr. Drew Pinsky also expressed concerns about Trump s mental health. The question, though, is, are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected? That s a pretty hard thing to predict. I don t know if this is just somebody playing politics, or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses? When I hear people that are impulsive with their speech, I worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions. At the time, psychiatrists were warned to avoid diagnosing Trump without personally examining him first. But that has all changed.Six months into Trump s presidency, the American Psychoanalytical Association has given permission to their 3,500 members to do just that.And you can bet Trump s head is going to explode.Former APA president Dr. Prudence Gourguechon explained the decision to STAT News. We don t want to prohibit our members from using their knowledge responsibly since Trump s behavior is so different from anything we ve seen before,  Dr. Gouguechon said.Indeed, Americans need this knowledge now more than ever before as Trump continues to lash out at anyone who criticizes him and is even starting to throw members of his own administration under the bus. His emotions and behavior are so unpredictable that it is understandable that people would worry, especially considering that Trump has access to nuclear weapons.It s time for Americans and Congress to demand Trump undergo a mental health exam by a board-certified psychiatrist. Furthermore, it s time to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump unfit to serve. This insanity has gone on long enough. America cannot continue to be led by an unstable narcissist. It s time to make America sane again.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wisconsin, Ohio, California and 10 other states said on Friday they were among 21 states that Russian government hackers targeted in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump though no votes were changed. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed it had notified the states of the activity but declined to identify them. Russia has denied election meddling, and President Trump has denied any collusion with Russia. Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, Texas and Washington state also confirmed they were targeted by Russian hackers but said they were not successful. Arizona and Illinois confirmed last year that they were targets.  The Associated Press confirmed Iowa, Maryland, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Oregon, Oklahoma and Virginia were also targets, bringing the total states identified to 21. Those states did not immediately return messages seeking comment late Friday. “There remains no evidence that the Russians altered one vote or changed one registration,” said Judd Choate, president of the U.S. National Association of State Election Directors.  Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Michael Haas said Homeland Security told the states that “Russian government cyber actors” targeted state voter registration systems. Homeland Security officials have said that in most of the 21 states only preliminary activity was observed from hackers and a small number of networks were compromised. Some states had complained in June they had no idea if Russians had attempted to infiltrate their systems. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Friday that hackers had scanned state election systems but not breached the system. “It is completely unacceptable that it has taken DHS over a year to inform our office of Russian scanning of our systems, despite our repeated requests for information,” he said. Homeland Security spokesman Scott McConnell said in a statement the government believes “officials should be kept informed about cybersecurity risks to election infrastructure” but also wants to protect “the integrity of investigations and the confidentiality of system owners.” U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the Kremlin orchestrated an operation that included hacking and online propaganda intended to help Trump win, Reuters reported in August. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who co-chairs the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, said Friday in a statement it is “unacceptable that it took almost a year after the election to notify states that their elections systems were targeted.” He said officials must inform states of attempts to enter election systems “just as any homeowner would expect the alarm company to inform them of all break-in attempts, even if the burglar doesn’t actually get inside the house.” Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams said DHS told it that its systems were scanned in the weeks before the 2016 election. “A scan is similar to burglars jiggling the doors of a house and moving on when they realize the doors are locked,” the state said. Washington state’s top election official, Kim Wyman, said the state learned in 2016 of attempted intrusions from Russian internet addresses and immediately alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The list of targets includes battleground states like Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa, but other key states like Michigan said Friday they were told they were not targeted. It also included states that were not seriously contested like California and Texas.         Wisconsin was one of a handful of battleground Midwestern states that helped Trump win the presidency over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Trump carried the state by 22,748 votes, or about 0.8 of a percentage point. Many of the other states were not seriously in contention in the 2016 race. Several congressional committees are investigating and special counsel Robert Mueller is leading a separate probe into the Russia matter, including whether Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign.",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The latest version of a House Republican bill to replace Obamacare would limit who could receive tax credits to help purchase health insurance, Politico reported on Monday, in an effort to secure the support of the chamber’s conservative wing.  Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump have repeatedly promised to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement but have publicly disagreed about the best way to do so. The House of Representatives is expected to unveil its legislation soon.  Under a Feb. 10 draft of the legislation made available to several news outlets, Republicans proposed offering an age-based refundable tax credit regardless of income level. That was resisted by conservatives who called it another entitlement program. Critics also said extremely wealthy people would receive the credit even though they do not need it.  In the most recent version of the bill, the tax credits would only be available to those within certain income levels, according to Politico. They would start to phase out for individuals earning $75,000 and households earning $150,000, and would be unavailable for individuals who earn more than $215,000, Politico reported.  Republicans had also initially proposed capping exemptions on employer-provided health coverage, a provision that drew the ire of some conservatives who said the bill would remove Obamacare’s taxes only to replace it with another.  According to Politico, the latest version of the bill would not include a cap. The bill also delays repealing several of Obamacare’s taxes until 2018, a year later than initially proposed, Politico reported.  ",1

"Republicans are hypocrites.And Ohio state GOP Rep. Wes Goodman proved it this week after he got caught having an affair with a man.Normally, having an affair with a man would not be a big deal. After all, same-sex marriage is legal and relationships with men is no longer the scandal it once was. But Goodman is a conservative  Christian  Republican who is married to a woman, so his affair with a member of the same sex is absolutely scandalous.So scandalous, in fact, that Goodman resigned from his post on Wednesday. We all bring our own struggles and our own trials into public life,  Goodman said in a statement.  That has been true for me, and I sincerely regret that my actions and choices have kept me from serving my constituents and our state in a way that reflects the best ideals of public service. For those whom I have let down, I m sorry. As I move onto the next chapter of my life, I sincerely ask for privacy for myself, my family, and my friends. Sorry, Mr. Goodman. But you don t get privacy nor can you expect to not be mercilessly mocked.Goodman preached  family values  and thinks same-sex marriage should be illegal and that gay people should be punished for being gay. He even bragged about being committed to  natural marriage  on his own campaign website.Ohio House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger accepted Goodman s resignation after he confirmed the allegations during a meeting. I was alerted to details yesterday afternoon regarding his involvement in inappropriate behavior related to his state office,  Rosenburger said.  I met with him later in the day where he acknowledged and confirmed the allegations. It became clear that his resignation was the most appropriate course of action for him, his family, the constituents of the 87th House District and this institution. Frankly, affairs like this shouldn t matter as long as the relations were consensual. But the fact that Goodman was fiercely anti-gay and carried on the affair in his taxpayer funded office makes it newsworthy and even more explosive.Here s a report on the story via YouTube.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats to protest Cuba’s failure to protect staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana from a mysterious spate of health “attacks,” spurring new tensions between the former Cold War foes. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the expulsions from Cuba’s embassy in Washington were also intended to ensure “equity” in staffing levels, after he recalled more than half the U.S. diplomatic personnel in Havana on Friday. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez denounced the decision as “unjustified,” accused the United States of insufficient cooperation with Cuba’s investigation of the health incidents and urged Washington to stop politicizing the matter. The steps taken by Republican President Donald Trump’s administration delivers another blow to his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama’s policy of rapprochement, including actions likely to erode the normalization of a relationship dominated for decades by mutual hostility and suspicion. The latest U.S. move was communicated to Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabanas on Tuesday, and the diplomats were given seven days to leave, a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Until the Government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,” Tillerson said in a statement. “We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,” he added. The United States announced on Friday that it was sharply reducing its diplomatic presence in Cuba, as it warned U.S. citizens not to visit the Communist-ruled island because of the alleged attacks it says have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in 22 U.S. embassy personnel. The State Department had said the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to U.S. citizens. Cuba has denied involvement in any attacks and says it has reinforced security for U.S. diplomatic personnel. Rodriguez said lack of U.S. cooperation had stymied its own investigation into the matter. Authorities had not provided access to the injured people and the doctors who examined them, or to the homes where the attacks allegedly took place, he said, adding that evidence had been delivered late.  Rodriguez urged the United States to cooperate more and said Cuba was also working with Canada on the investigation as Canadian diplomats have reported similar symptoms. So far, none of the probes have yielded any answers about how the alleged attacks were carried out or who was responsible. Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be kicked out in retaliation for the Cuban government’s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks. “I commend the U.S. State Department for expelling a number of Cuban operatives from the U.S.,” Rubio, an influential voice on Trump’s Cuba policy, said in a statement. But James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washington-based pro-engagement lobbying group said: “This decision appears to be purely political, driven by the desire of a handful of individuals in Congress to halt progress between our two countries.” “It looks like we are returning the threats and tensions of the 1960s,” said Maria Fernandez, a 45-year-old office worker in Havana. “This is madness by Trump. It’s really sad, because we are so close, and yet so far away from a sincere rapprochement.” Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama after five decades of hostility, called the Cuban government “corrupt and destabilizing” in his address to the United Nations last month. Cuba described his comments as “unacceptable and meddling.” Rodriguez urged the United States “not to continue politicizing this matter, which can provoke an undesirable escalation and could rarify and reverse even more bilateral relations.” In Havana, U.S. diplomats frantically selling off their belongings at garage sales and on social media, said they were disappointed to be ordered to leave. In a message on Facebook, the embassy’s top official, career diplomat Scott Hamilton, said he would also be leaving. “I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,” he wrote. “Hasta la proxima Cuba.” ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled the names of 11 judges - eight men and three women, all white and all conservative - he would consider, if elected, to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Six of them are judges who were appointed to federal appeals courts around the country by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other five serve on various state supreme courts. Scalia’s replacement could tip the ideological balance of the court, which now is evenly divided with four conservative justices and four liberals. Scalia, who died in February, was one of the court’s most conservative justices. “We’re going to choose from, most likely from this list,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. But Trump said he could deviate from the list and added, “At a minimum we will keep people within this general realm.”  All of Trump’s 11 judges are listed as affiliated with the Federalist Society on the influential conservative legal group’s website. The organization is known as a breeding ground for conservative legal thinkers. It is unusual for a presidential candidate to release names of potential Supreme Court or Cabinet nominees before winning an election. But Trump is working to assure conservatives in his own party that, if elected president on Nov. 8, he would not appoint a liberal or moderate to the court. Trump allies had encouraged him to announce the names of potential court nominees to allay fears among conservatives wary of a Trump presidency. Trump’s list includes: Steven Colloton of Iowa, a judge on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Raymond Gruender of Missouri, also a judge on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, a judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. It also includes: Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, a judge on the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals; William Pryor of Alabama, a judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin, a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. The state supreme court jurists include: Allison Eid of Colorado; Joan Larsen of Michigan; Thomas Lee of Utah; David Stras of Minnesota; and Don Willett of Texas. Democratic President Barack Obama in March named centrist appellate court judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy. But the Republican-led Senate has refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote, insisting that Obama’s successor should get to select Scalia’s replacement.  Trump said in a statement that the 11 judges were “representative of the kind of constitutional principles I value” and said he would use the list as a guide for nominating a justice. Willett in the past year has posted several comments on Twitter mocking Trump, even referring to him as “Darth Trump,” a twist on the “Star Wars” villain Darth Vader. Willett last June posted about imagining Trump selecting a Supreme Court nominee. “The mind reels. *weeps—can’t finish tweet*,” Willett wrote, suggesting he was crying at the idea. Asked to comment on Willett’s Twitter remarks, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, “Mr. Trump’s sole focus is considering the best potential individuals based on their constitutional principles.” Lee is the brother of Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate. “I don’t know everyone on the list, but those I do know would all be great Supreme Court Justices. Of course, I do believe one name on that list stands head and shoulders above the rest,” said Mike Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would consider any nomination. Sykes is the former wife of conservative Wisconsin radio host Charles Sykes, who posted on Twitter that she would make a great justice but added, “I simply don’t believe Trump.” Several of the judges have ruled against abortion and reproductive rights. Sykes, Colloton and Pryor have ruled against the Obama administration regarding religious objections to the contraception coverage requirement of the Obamacare healthcare law.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at his daily briefing that he would be surprised if any Democrat would describe any of Trump’s picks “as a consensus nominee.” “But the individual President Obama has put forward is somebody that Republicans have described as a consensus nominee,” Earnest said of Garland, adding that it would be wise for the Senate to act on Obama’s nominee. Liberal advocacy group People for the American Way said  Trump’s list included “conservative dream justices.” Most of the 11 judges did not respond to requests for comment.  “Joan Larsen is working along with the rest of Michigan’s Supreme Court to provide common-sense, rule-of-law justice. That is her focus and will remain her focus,” her campaign spokesman Stu Sandler said. Larsen was appointed to the post and is running for election to a full term.  ",1
"(Reuters) - About 146,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since violence erupted in Myanmar in late August, U.N. workers said on Wednesday. This has brought to 233,000 the number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October 2016. The exodus has put pressure on aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous violence in Myanmar.  Following are some details on the crisis gathered from U.N. sources working in the Cox s Bazar district of Bangladesh, on the Myanmar border. *Landmine injuries occurred on Sept. 5 with two children brought in for treatment at the Gundum border area.  *The influx of refugees via marine routes has increased, with a sharp increase noted in Shamlapur from 1,090 individuals on Sept. 4 to 12,500 on Sept. 5. *Around 33,000 refugees have gathered at three new spontaneous settlements that have sprung up at Unchiprang, Moinar Ghona and Thangkhali. There are acute humanitarian needs in these rapidly expanding settlements, especially for emergency health, safe water, food and shelter support. *Four mobile medical teams are being deployed to different locations, and two more are planned. *No deliveries were performed by the midwives in the last two days for new arrivals, indicating that many may have delivered outside of available health facilities. *Strengthened family tracing mechanisms are needed for unaccompanied children and other separated families. Most children have arrived with their mothers as their fathers are missing or arrested.  *A total of 177 incidents of gender-based violence have been reported in the refugee camps since Aug. 27. Eighteen survivors of this violence have been referred for life-saving medical care. About 240 women and 60 men, including survivors of gender-based violence, attended stress management sessions.   *The community clinic in Kutupalong is overwhelmed with patients, resulting in long lines for waiting and inefficient service provision for survivors of gender-based violence seeking emergency health services. The cost of transport prohibits beneficiaries from travelling to health facilities where emergency sexual and reproductive health services are available, including clinical management of rape.  ",1
"(Reuters) - Alan Futerfas, the lawyer Donald Trump Jr. has hired to represent him in connection with Russia-related probes, has over 25 years experience in handling government investigations and criminal cases. John Moscow, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, described Futerfas as a “top-flight lawyer” who is both “high-powered and low-key.” Here are some facts about Futerfas: He became a top mob defense lawyer early on Miami-born Futerfas joined the law firm of veteran criminal defense lawyer Gerald Shargel after graduating from Yeshiva University’s Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York in 1987, and quickly became a partner. He left to form his own firm in 1994. In one of his biggest cases from that period, Futerfas won a new trial in 1997 for mob captain Anthony Russo after it was revealed that a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent may have  leaked information to fuel an organized crime war in the early 1990s. He expanded into white-collar cases Futerfas encountered Moscow in the early 2000s case against former Tyco International chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski. Futerfas represented Christine Berry, Kozlowski’s art consultant, in the sales tax avoidance investigation that led to the larger case over Kozlowski’s corporate “looting.” In 2010, he represented hedge fund group HFV Management in connection with a wide-ranging probe by the New York attorney general’s office into corruption in the state’s pension fund.   He has also handled cybercrime cases Futerfas is defending Ziv Orenstein, one of three Israelis charged by federal prosecutors with hacking into JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and the Wall Street Journal (NWSA.O), among other rtargets, as part of a massive “pump and dump” scheme. Orenstein pleaded not guilty.  Another client of Futerfas was Nikita Kuzmin, a Russian national who agreed last year to pay $6.9 million for creating computer malware that made users’ bank accounts vulnerable to cyber criminals. He worked one summer for a longtime lawyer to Donald Trump In the summer of 1985, while he was in law school, Futerfas worked for lawyer Jay Goldberg, who went on to become Trump’s divorce lawyer.  Futerfas said he did not come to Trump Jr. through Goldberg. He studied at Juilliard Futerfas earned his undergraduate degree from the prestigious performing arts school. He still plays bass trombone for the Park Avenue Chamber Symphony.  (Corrects paragraph 5 to “may have leaked” instead of “deliberately leaked”) ",1
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s top newspaper warned Communist Party officials on Thursday not to  pray to God and worship Buddha , because communism is about atheism and superstition is at the root of many corrupt officials who fall from grace. China officially guarantees freedom of religion for major belief systems like Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, but party members are meant to be atheists and are especially banned from participating in what China calls superstitious practices like visiting soothsayers. The party s official People s Daily said in a commentary it had not been uncommon over the past few years to see officials taken down for corruption to have also participated in  feudalistic superstitious activities .  In fact, some officials often go to monasteries, pray to God and worship Buddha,  it said.  Some officials are obsessed with rubbing shoulders with masters, fraternizing with them as brothers and becoming their lackeys and their money-trees.  Chinese people, especially the country s leaders, have a long tradition of putting their faith in soothsaying and geomancy, looking for answers in times of doubt, need and chaos. The practice has grown more risky amid a sweeping crackdown on deep-seated corruption launched by President Xi Jinping upon assuming power in late 2012, in which dozens of senior officials have been imprisoned. The People s Daily pointed to the example of Li Chuncheng, a former deputy party chief in Sichuan who was jailed for 13 years in 2015 for bribery and abuse of power, who it said was an enthusiastic user of the traditional Chinese geomancy practice of fengshui. Another much more junior official, in the southern province of Jiangxi, wore charms to ward off bad luck, it said.  As an official, if you spend all your time fixating on crooked ways, sooner or later you ll come to grief,  it said. The founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, banned fortune telling and superstition in puritan, communist China after the 1949 revolution, but the occult has made a comeback since the still officially atheist country embraced economic reforms and began opening up in the late 1970s. In one of the most famous recent cases, China s powerful former security chief Zhou Yongkang was jailed for life in part due to accusations he leaked undisclosed state secrets to a fortune teller and healer called Cao Yongzheng, known as the  Xinjiang sage  after the far western region where he grew up. The People s Daily said officials must remember Marx s guiding words that  Communism begins from the outset with atheism .  Superstition is thought pollution and spiritual anesthesia that cannot be underestimated and must be thoroughly purged,  it said. ",1
"DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte thanked Moscow on Friday for its  timely assistance  in defeating pro-Islamic State militants who took over a southern city for months, expressing his willingness to buy Russian weapons. Duterte last month declared the liberation of Marawi City from Islamist militants after 154 days of fighting, which killed more than 1,100 people, including 165 soldiers, and displaced nearly 400,000 residents.   I want to build a strong armed forces and a strong police and the reason is very important for you to know that we are eyeing - we are buying arms from Russia this time,  Duterte told Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. The Philippines was to buy more than 20,000 assault rifles from the United States, but some senators, concerned with Duterte s human rights record and rising killings, blocked that sale. But China and Russia, whose relations with the Philippines have vastly improved in recent months, donated a total of 11,000 assault rifles and trucks.  Your timely assistance to my country helped us replenish the old arms and the spent bores that were fired repeatedly and we have a new stock,  he said, in transcripts sent to Manila by the presidential communications office. Manila and Moscow signed a military deal on logistics, including a contract with a state-owned company for the supply of equipment, during the first-ever visit by a Russian defense minister to the Philippines last month.  The Philippines will have a 125 billion pesos ($2.44 billion) fund to modernize the military from 2018 to 2022 through a multi-year congressional allocation to upgrade its hardware, a senior military official told Reuters.  We are looking at helicopters, small arms and equipment for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, but we are still discussing the specifics,  said the same military official who declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the press.  We still prefer U.S. and Western equipment but they are very expensive. If the Russians and Chinese equipment can be comparable in quality, then they can be excellent alternatives.    ",1
"RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - The ancient mud brick walls circling Raqqa s deserted old city are almost the only structure still intact. Inside, shops and homes spill crumbling concrete onto either side of the narrow roads, block after block. Fighting between U.S.-backed militias and Islamic State in the jihadist group s former Syria stronghold has peppered mosques and minarets with machine-gun fire while air strikes flattened houses. No building is untouched.  The old clock tower could be heard from outside the walls once. It s damaged now. It s silent,  Mohammed Hawi, an Arab fighter from Raqqa, said at a nearby home occupied by the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance (SDF). Raqqa, where Islamic State plotted attacks abroad during its three-year rule, is almost captured in a months-old offensive backed by U.S. air cover and special forces. But driving militants out has caused destruction that officials say will take years and cost millions of dollars to repair. The nascent Raqqa Civil Council, set up to rebuild and govern Raqqa, faces a huge task. It says aid from countries in the U.S.-led coalition fighting IS is so far insufficient. Raqqa s uncertain political future, as it comes under the sway of Kurdish-led forces which neighbor Turkey opposes, and is still coveted by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, is partly what has made coalition countries hesitate, diplomats say. But failure to quickly return services to the city that was once home to more than 200,000 people, mostly now displaced, risks unrest, they warn.  Infrastructure is completely destroyed, water, electricity networks, bridges. There s not a single service functioning,  said Ibrahim Hassan, who oversees reconstruction for the Raqqa council at its headquarters in nearby Ain Issa.  We gave our city as a sacrifice for the sake of defeating terrorism. It s the world s duty to help us,  he said. A major bridge leading into eastern Raqqa lies collapsed after a coalition air strike. Beyond it, damaged water towers and the skeletons of teetering residential blocks dot the skyline. Awnings hung by militants to hide their movements flap in the wind. Senior council member Omar Alloush estimated at least half the city is completely destroyed.  There are also bodies under rubble, of civilians and terrorists. These need reburying to avoid disease outbreaks,  he said. Amnesty International has said the U.S.-led campaign, including air strikes, has killed hundreds of civilians trapped in Raqqa. Residents have reported civilian deaths, but it is difficult to establish how many people have died. The coalition says it does all it can to avoid civilian casualties. But the city is densely built up and militants firing from homes are often targeted by air raids. Council officials said with the battle still raging in a small, encircled area of the city center and countless explosives rigged by militants in areas they abandoned, reconstruction has not yet begun.  The focus is on emergency aid, food and water, de-mining,  Hassan said. The council wants to get services up and running as soon as possible, but has limited capacity and is staffed by volunteers. At its headquarters the offices of several departments consist of a single desk in a shared room.  Support from the international community has improved and we feel less isolated, but it s been modest,  Hassan said. The United States delivered several bulldozers and other vehicles to the council to clear debris recently, the Raqqa council said, out of a total of 56 due to arrive.  Even 700 wouldn t be enough,  Alloush said. Raqqa council volunteers have said they told the coalition it will take 5.3 billion Syrian lira (about $10 million) a year to restore power and water supplies, roads and schools. It is feared delays could reignite unrest.  Groups that took over Raqqa in 2013 didn t run it well,  a Western diplomat in the region said, referring to Syrian insurgents who seized the city from Assad s forces earlier in the six-year-old civil war, before IS arrived.  That s partly what allowed Daesh (IS) to take over. If there s a gap in humanitarian assistance and no effective local governance structure, the risk of future violence increases.  The council said coalition countries were reluctant to aid the Raqqa council, made up of local engineers, teachers and doctors.  We ve suffered from bureaucracy in the decision making process for foreign aid,  Hassan said. Some coalition countries were concerned about relations with NATO member Turkey over support for a governing body perceived to be allied to Kurdish militia, the diplomat said. The SDF, which for now controls much of Raqqa, is spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, a foe of Ankara which is fighting its own Kurdish insurgency. Turkey opposes the YPG s role in capturing Raqqa. Council officials say Raqqa will be governed independently of a self-run administration for northeast Syria that is dominated by Kurds, but is expected to have close relations with it. The extent of those relations is to be decided by elected officials once elections can be held. A second diplomat in the region said reluctance to aid the council was partly over concerns whether it properly represented the ethnic make-up of mostly Arab Raqqa, seeing tension if local Arabs were sidelined. Several prominent council members are Kurdish. There is also uncertainty over whether Raqqa will remain allied to the self-run parts of northern Syria, or if it would fall back to Assad in future upheaval. Assad has sworn to retake the entire country. For now, with Turkey s borders closed to SDF-controlled areas, aid to Raqqa comes a longer route through Iraq s Kurdish region. Raqqa council says it may have to be self-sufficient.  We re waiting for help to repair the east bridge,  co-president Leila Mustafa, a civil engineer, said.  If it doesn t arrive soon, we ll begin ourselves, using any means we have.  ",1

"The State Department misplaced and lost some $6 billion due to the improper filing of contracts during the past six years, mainly during the tenure of former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, according to a newly released Inspector General report. The $6 billion in unaccounted funds poses a  significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department s contract actions,  according to the report. The alert, originally sent on March 20 and just released this week, warns that the missing contracting funds  could expose the department to substantial financial losses.  The report centered on State Department contracts worth  more than $6 billion in which contract files were incomplete or could not be located at all,  according to the alert.  The failure to maintain contract files adequately creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department s contract actions,  the alert states.Read more: WT",0
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled a rally scheduled for Friday night in Chicago after the event turned into a chaotic scene with thousands of attendees split into opposing camps of supporters of the Republican front-runner and protesters inflamed by his candidacy. A Trump campaign staffer took the stage nearly a half hour after the rally was slated to begin and said it would be postponed for safety reasons. A campaign statement issued slightly later said the event would be held on another unspecified day. Following the announcement, the crowd began to chant and cheer. Scuffles broke out as signs were ripped from hands and police moved in to quickly defuse the most serious scuffles.  Cries of “We dumped Trump! We dumped Trump!” rose inside the University of Illinois at Chicago pavilion where the event was held. An opposing group yelled: “We want Trump! We want Trump!”  Outside the pavilion, chants of “We shut it down!” rippled through the crowd on news of the cancellation. Chicago activists had spent the week leading up to the rally planning how to disrupt it. Trump has become a particularly polarizing candidate in the presidential campaign. He has both inspired impassioned supporters and ignited a backlash of angry dissent with his promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants and his call to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims into the country. One group at Friday’s event, Showing Up for Racial Justice, coordinated with minority student groups on campuses, using group email chains and messaging so that protesters could stay in constant communication.  One of the organizers, Nathaniel Lewis, 25, a master’s degree student in public health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said he was shocked they succeeded in shutting the rally down. “I’m happy, I’m at peace because we came together as a collective,” Lewis told Reuters.  “This is the last thing we expected to happen, it shows the power of unity.” Trump, speaking to MSNBC by telephone shortly after the canceled event, said he met with law enforcement after arriving in Chicago. Though he believed it would have been possible to move forward, he said he made the “wise decision” to postpone the rally to keep everyone safe. “We were not consulted or involved in the decision to cancel the event,” Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters. Trump brushed off questions from MSNBC’s Chris Matthews about whether such widespread disruptions were to be expected given the increasingly aggressive tenor of recent campaign events. Trump said his supporters had planned for a peaceful rally but it was derailed by the crowd of protesters. “You can’t even have a rally in a major city in this country anymore,” Trump said. “Up until this point we’ve had no problem.” Trump told MSNBC he expected support for his candidacy would only increase. Earlier in the day, at a rally in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump had been speaking for less than 10 minutes when protesters began interrupting him. The disruptions continued over the next hour as Trump urged security to “get them out.” “Can I be honest with you, it adds to the flavor, it’s more exciting. Isn’t this better than listening to a long boring speech?” Trump said of the disruptions. At some events, altercations have turned physical. In New Orleans last week, several protesters supporting the Black Lives Matter movement were dragged out as Trump shouted “get them.” In Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Wednesday, protesters interrupted Trump’s speech more than 16 times. One was punched as he was led from the arena. Jedidiah Brown, 29, dashed onto the Chicago stage where Trump was expected to speak Friday and tore the campaign sign from the podium before police took him outside. He was not arrested. “I was born and raised in Chicago so I felt it was my responsibility to let him know he’s not welcome here,” Brown said. “The message Trump is spreading all over the country, it doesn’t work here.” Outside, Tess King, 25, a social sciences and law student, was carrying a sign that said “Chicago Rejects Trump.” King had tried to get into the rally but the event was canceled before she got in the door. “I feel incredibly happy that in our city we managed, through peaceful expression, to make this happen,” King told Reuters. As the crowd began to trickle out, Josh Glaspie, 28, smoked a cigarette on a sidewalk strewn with discarded signs. Glaspie, an Army veteran who is trying to open a restaurant in Chicago, said he supports Trump. “Trump’s not racist,” Glaspie said. “These people don’t even know why they’re protesting.”  (Additional reporting by Ginger Gibson, Eric Walsh and Amanda Becker; Writing by Amanda Becker; Editing by Leslie Adler, Robert Birsel) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - Humanitarian crises around the world will worsen next year with no let-up in African civil wars, near-famines in conflict-ridden regions and the threat of Islamist violence, a Geneva-based think-tank predicted in a report published on Thursday. The report by ACAPS, a non-profit venture that supports humanitarian aid workers with daily monitoring and analysis of 150 countries, examined the anticipated needs of 18 countries in 2018 and found little to cheer.  If 2017 did not look good, predictions for 2018 are no better: violence and insecurity are likely to deteriorate in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, Ethiopia, Mali, Somalia, and Syria next year,  ACAPS director Lars Peter Nissen wrote in the report. Next year Ethiopia will join northeastern Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen as places at risk of famine, said the report, entitled ""Humanitarian Overview: An analysis of key crises into 2018"". here In a separate report, the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network said an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries were likely to need food aid in 2018, driven by conflict, an 18-month-old drought in the Horn of Africa and forecasts for below average rains in Africa s spring next year.  Rather than bringing stability, the prospect of elections in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, South Sudan and Venezuela is expected to exacerbate tensions and fuel violence, the ACAPS report said.  Islamic extremism will also continue to cause death and conflict, the report said. Despite the defeat of Islamic State in its main strongholds in Iraq, the group is expected to continue improvised attacks throughout the country to destabilise the government, as well as gaining strength and resources in southern Libya. Islamic State is also likely to increase its toehold in the Puntland region of Somalia, impacting the civilian population and clashing with its bigger regional rival Al Shabaab, which will increase the lethality of its own attacks. ACAPS said Islamist armed groups are also expected to take advantage of the withdrawal of government troops from central Mali, gaining local recruits and further influence, while in Afghanistan the Taliban will consolidate rural strongholds and increased opium production will boost funding for armed groups. The fragmentation of armed groups in Central African Republic is expected to worsen the violence there, sending more refugees into Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo, where President Joseph Kabila is unlikely to leave power until 2019, fuelling frustration and violent protest, the report said.  Militia groups previously focused on local grievances will likely become increasingly frustrated by the national, political, and socioeconomic situation and are likely to increase violence, particularly against government forces and institutions,  the report said.

"President Obama was asked during a press conference what his thoughts were on the likelihood of a Donald Trump presidency. Pulling no punches, he laid out exactly why Donald Trump will never be president: I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president, and the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people, and I think they recognize that being president is a serious job. It s not hosting a talk show or a reality show, it s not promotion, it s not marketing, it s hard. And a lot of people count on us getting it right, and it s not a matter of pandering and doing whatever gets you in the news on a given day. Source: The HillWhile President Obama maintained his normally cool demeanor and smooth delivery, he still managed to deliver what can only be described as a hell of a sick burn to Trump and the people that support his carnival barker shenanigans. Trump has no qualifications for being president, and Obama knows it. Most of the American people know it. His only supporters are about a third of the Republican fringe who run on pure emotion and are otherwise clueless about civics, and how government works.President Obama didn t restrict his criticism only to Trump.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said Thursday it is working to cut off revenue streams to North Korea by targeting remittances from its overseas workers, after recent nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a House of Representatives hearing that the United States is working “relentlessly” to get countries to cut off businesses sending money back to North Korea.  He also said Washington is working to encourage the sending home of North Korean diplomats not engaged in diplomatic activity and to make sure that people did not travel to North Korea, including for the May 6 congress of the ruling Workers Party.     “What we are focused on, besides the implementation of the (U.N.) Security Council resolutions, is relentlessly building pressure on North Korea, working principally with our key allies Japan and (South) Korea,” Blinken said.  “We are working in various ways to cut off all the revenues going to the regime. For example, they have ... overseas workers whose remittances are not going back to their families, but are going to the regime. We’re working to cut those off.”     Estimates of North Korean workers abroad vary widely but a study by South Korea’s state-run Korea Institute for National Unification put the number as high as 150,000, primarily in China and Russia, sending back as much as $900 million annually. North Koreans are known to work abroad in restaurants and on construction sites, and also as doctors.     The United States is also working to make sure North Korean officials are not invited to travel abroad and to ensure North Korean ships and aircraft are not allowed to dock or land in other countries, Blinken said. The senior U.S. diplomat for Asia, assistant secretary of state for East Asia, Danny Russel, said last week that another North Korean nuclear test could trigger new sanctions including an effort to choke off hard currency earnings by its overseas workers abroad. North Korea has conducted a series of missile launches, in violation of U.N. resolutions in the run-up to the Party congress and experts believe it may conduct a new nuclear test before this convenes.

"A man shouting  Allahu Akbar  has stabbed two women to death with a butcher s knife before being gunned down by soldiers in Marseille.The victims, aged 17 and 20, suffered horrific injuries during the  frenzied  attack, with one slashed in the throat and the other stabbed in the chest and stomach.Eyewitnesses told how a man  dressed in black  launched himself at the two women, who screamed for their lives as others ran for safety.The assailant was gunned down by soldiers who were on patrol inside Saint Charles train station at the time as part of France s ongoing state of emergency.The suspect, thought to be aged 25 to 30, was known to authorities for common law crimes while analysis of his fingerprints came up with several aliases.Photographs from the scene showed a woman lying on the ground and armed police standing over the attacker. A white sheet was later placed over his body.In a tweet, President Emmanuel Macron said:  Deeply outraged by this barbaric act, in pain with the families and relatives of the victims of Marseille. I hail the Operation Sentinelle soldiers and the police forces who reacted with extreme calmness and efficiency.

"(Reuters) - The National Football League said on Tuesday it opposes a tax bill proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Republicans that could force teams to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction. Under the legislation unveiled last week, local governments could no longer fund the building or renovation of professional sports stadiums by issuing tax-exempt, public-purpose bonds, the sort of bonds typically used to fund schools, libraries and public transit. According to the NFL, building new stadiums enhances economic development in cities that are home to the venues and federal tax breaks should be available. “You can look around the country and see the economic development that’s generated from some of these stadiums,” NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart told a conference call. “These sorts of infrastructure projects have a long history and the benefits of them are obvious in many of our communities around the country, so we will continue to make our opposition known on that.” President Donald Trump has called for an end to the subsidy, at least for the NFL, after some of its players angered the Republican president by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial bias in the criminal justice system. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also proposed ending the tax break for stadiums in 2015. A report last year by the Brookings Institution, the Washington-based social sciences research group, found that of the 45 major-league stadiums built or overhauled since 2000, 36 were at least partly funded by tax-exempt municipal bonds. The NFL’s Oakland Raiders are expected to begin playing in Las Vegas in 2020 and construction on a new stadium is already underway. Lockhart refused to what, if any, impact the bill could have on the viability of the new stadium. “That is a hypothetical at this point and we’d have to see how the final bill comes out,” he said. “What gets proposed out of the writing committee from the party in control very often is not what is eventually signed into law, so we’ll have to see where that goes.”             ",1
"Steve Bannon has a clear, strong agenda for Trump s relationship with the press. The far-right white supremacist just did a rare interview with The New York Times, which is ironic considering how much he seems to hate the press, and he took the opportunity to paint the press as an incompetent enemy. In that interview, he said, point-blank: The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. Listen to what? More of Trump s lies? The press should let his lies go unchallenged? Just for the record, the press does not like being told they can t challenge public figures. The press does not like being muzzled.So, one member of the press, CNN s Jake Tapper, responded to that with something thoughtful and eloquent, yet appropriately brief. Watch below: No    @jaketapper to Steve Bannon pic.twitter.com/VT2tfyTm3q  Colin Jones (@colinjones) January 26, 2017And he s laughing at the very notion of shutting up and listening. It s brilliant in the face of Bannon saying,  Sit down, shut up, and let him lie all he wants.  That s really what it comes down to   letting the administration put forth unchecked lies so they can create the reality they want. In fact, Bannon actually told the Times to quote him on this: I want you to quote this,  Mr. Bannon added.  The media here is the opposition party. They don t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.  [emphasis mine]So the media should shut up. Stop with the criticism. Stop with the challenges. It hurts Donald s little feefees and we just can t have that.Too bad for them that the press isn t going to listen.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",0
"BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States government upholds and sticks to the “one China” policy, U.S. President Donald Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday during talks in Beijing, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported. As president-elect, Trump broke with protocol and accepted a congratulatory phone call from the Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in December, angering China, which claims the self-ruled island as integral Chinese territory.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation has found breaches in Illinois and Arizona’s voter registration databases and is urging states to increase computer security ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, according to a U.S. official familiar with the probe. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday that investigators were also seeking evidence of whether other states may have been targeted. The FBI warning in an Aug. 18 flash alert from the agency’s Cyber Division did not identify the intruders or the two states targeted. Reuters obtained a copy of the document after Yahoo News first reported the story Monday. Accessing information in a voter database, much of which is publicly accessible, does not necessarily suggest an effort to manipulate the votes themselves. When registering, voters typically provide their names, home addresses, driver’s license or identification numbers, and party affiliations.  But U.S. intelligence officials have become increasingly worried that hackers sponsored by Russia or other countries may attempt to disrupt the presidential election.  Officials and cyber security experts say recent breaches at the Democratic National Committee and elsewhere in the Democratic Party were likely carried out by people within the Russian government. Kremlin officials have denied that.  An FBI spokeswoman would not comment on the alerts but said the agency “routinely advises” on “various cyber threat indicators observed during the course of our investigations.” The intrusions come amid repeated unsubstantiated claims by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that the U.S. election system is “rigged.” Trump has cited emails leaked from the DNC that indicated the party leadership favored Hillary Clinton over rival candidate Bernie Sanders as reason to cast doubt on the electoral process in general. David Kennedy, chief executive officer of information security consulting company TrustedSec, said the attacks referenced in the FBI alert appeared to be largely exploratory and not especially sophisticated. “It could be a precursor to a larger attack,” he added. Citing a state election board official, Yahoo News said the Illinois voter registration system was shut down for 10 days in late July after hackers downloaded personal data on up to 200,000 voters. State voter systems are often targeted by hackers, and 200,000 is a relatively small number compared to other recent incidents. An independent computer security researcher uncovered in December of last year a database on 191 million voters that was exposed on the open Internet due to an incorrect configuration. The Arizona attack was more limited and involved introducing malicious software into one state employee’s computer, said Matt Roberts, communications director for the Arizona secretary of state’s office.  That office publicly reported a cyber incident in June after being contacted by the FBI, which led to it temporarily shutting down its election site to deal with the potential threat.  Roberts said he was uncertain if the FBI advisory was in reference to that same June incident, during which investigators found no evidence of any data exfiltration. In that episode, the FBI told Arizona officials the hackers were believed to be Russian and described it as an “eight out of 10” on a threat severity scale, Roberts said. Arizona will hold Republican and Democratic primaries for congressional races on Tuesday.     ",1
"What happens when Hillary s poll numbers take a nose-dive after she s caught having convulsions in a  press-free  zone, passes out, and has to lifted into her vehicle by secret service? What happens when the public realizes Hillary is a sociopathic liar and they decide they can no longer support her, even if her genitalia matches theirs? They panic and then they resort to the most despicable act of all impugning the character of Donald J. Trump by using a FROG to paint him as a  racist!  pinning him to ONE person on Twitter who used Pepe the Frog to push a  White Nationalist  message. According to the liberal rag The Daily Beast the Twitter user is a self-proclaimed 19 yr old White Supremacist. The Hillary campaign is desperate, and is looking for any excuse they can think of to take down their formidable opponent, Donald J. Trump. How do they do it? With a frog From the Hillary.com website:Over the weekend, Donald Trump s son and one of his closest advisers posted an odd photo on their social media accounts:This raised some important questions.That s Pepe. He s a symbol associated with white supremacy.That s right.Here s the short version: Pepe is a cartoon frog who began his internet life as an innocent meme enjoyed by teenagers and pop stars alike.But in recent months, Pepe s been almost entirely co-opted by the white supremacists who call themselves the  alt-right.  They ve decided to take back Pepe by adding swastikas and other symbols of anti-semitism and white supremacy. We basically mixed Pepe in with Nazi propaganda, etc. We built that association,  one prominent white supremacist told the Daily Beast.Trump has retweeted his white supremacist supporters with regularity, but the connection between the alt-right and his campaign continues to strengthen. Trump has been slow to disavow support from Ku Klux Klansmen (HILLARY IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO HAS RECEIVED OVER $20,000 IN DONATIONS FROM THE KKK AND HAS BEEN OPENLY ENDORSED BY THE HATE GROUP) and white supremacy groups, and he recently hired Breitbart.com s Steve Bannon as his campaign CEO (and Bannon isn t shy about the fact that his  news  organization is the  platform for the alt-right ).Now white supremacists have given Pepe the cartoon frog some Trump hair and the candidate s own son says he is  honored to be grouped with  him.Let me get this straight: Trump s presidential campaign is posting memes associated with white supremacy online?Yes.Like all great art, Pepe was open to endless interpretation, but at the end of the day, he meant whatever you wanted him to mean. All in good fun, teens made Batman Pepe, Supermarket Checkout Girl Pepe, Borat Pepe, Keith Haring Pepe, and carved Pepe pumpkins.But he also embodied existential angst. Pepe, the grimiest but most versatile meme of all, was both hero and antihero a symbol fit for all of life s ups and downs and the full spectrum of human emotions, as they played out online.On social media, Pepe became inescapable. Katy Perry tweeted a crying Pepe with the caption  Australian jet lag got me like,  racking up over 10,000 retweets. Nicki Minaj posted a twerking Pepe on Instagram with the caption  Me on Instagram for the next few weeks trying to get my followers back up,  which 282,000 users  liked. And then, recently, things took a turn: Pepe became socially unacceptable.Here is a screen shot of the PARODY account @JaredTSwift the Daily Beast and Hillary s campaign refer to:Yep that s it. Pepe the Frog was used by a singe Twitter user who clearly identifies his account as  PARODY,  so if Trump or anyone associated with Trump uses Pepe the Frog (who has been used by literally hundreds of thousands of social media users) Trump must be a  racist!  There is absolutely no mention of Jared Taylor Swift s support for Donald J. Trump in his bio or in his Pepe the Frog posts. But that s how these liberal rags roll, and Hillary jumped right on that bandwagon without any evidence whatsoever, in a desperate effort to tie Trump to this ONE anonymous PARODY Twitter user.This YouTube video does a great job of mocking Hillary and her campaign for attempting to pin a  racist  label on the cartoon frog in hopes that it would in turn make American voters believe Trump is a  racist  just like the cartoon frog Enjoy:",0

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Satellite images taken this month of a North Korean naval shipyard indicate Pyongyang is pursuing an  aggressive schedule  to build its first operational ballistic missile submarine, a U.S. institute reported on Thursday. Washington-based 38 North, a North Korea monitoring project,  cited images taken on Nov. 5 showing activity at North Korea s Sinpo South Shipyard.  The presence of what appear to be sections of a submarine s pressure hull in the yards suggests construction of a new submarine, possibly the SINPO-C ballistic missile submarine - the follow-on to the current SINPO-class experimental ballistic missile submarine,  38 North said in a report. The report said that throughout 2017 there had been continued movement of parts and components into and out of two parts yards adjacent to the constructions halls in the center of the shipyard. It said the Nov. 5 images showed two large circular objects that could be sections of a submarine s pressure hull. It said these appeared larger than those for North Korea s ROMEO-class attack submarine. Images of a test stand indicated continued testing of a  mechanism for ejection launch of missiles from a submarine. However, the report said no activity could be seen suggesting  preparations for a new test of a submarine-launched missile. North Korea has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, sparking a major international crisis in which U.S. President Donald Trump has said that all options are under consideration, including military ones. North Korea is also thought to be working on a solid-fuel missile for submarine launches. Last month, The Diplomat magazine quoted a U.S. government source as saying U.S. military intelligence had detected a new diesel-electric submarine under construction at Sinpo and  dubbed it the Sinpo-C. It said the submarine was likely a larger successor to North Korea s single experimental ballistic missile submarine. North Korea has conducted dozens of missile tests this year and its largest and biggest nuclear test on Sept. 3. The past two months have seen a relative lull and it has not tested a missile since firing one over Japan on Sept. 15. Another article in The Diplomat last month quoted a U.S. government source as saying that North Korea had tested a new solid fuel engine sometime between Oct. 15 and Oct. 21. U.S. intelligence officials have declined to comment on this. ",1
"(Reuters) - Republic of Congo President Denis Sassou plans to meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday to discuss the ongoing political turmoil crisis in Libya and other African issues, Sassou’s spokesman said on Monday. Sassou’s spokesman Thierry Moungalla, in a post on Twitter, noted that the two men were meeting to discuss ways to the end the Libyan crisis as well other broader issues affecting the continent, according to a statement attached to the tweet. He did not give any other details about the meeting plans.  Representatives for Trump’s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment seeking to confirm the meeting with the incoming Republican president, who takes office Jan. 20 and is spending this week at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  Libya is grappling with continuing political turmoil as rival governments split the nation’s East and West, and other armed factions also compete for power. The United Nations earlier this month also cited an ongoing human rights crisis affecting migrants there. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, has been holding an ongoing stream of meetings at his property in Palm Beach as well as Trump Tower in New York City as he prepares to assume the White House from Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama. Most of his meetings have centered on possible candidates to serve in his administration, including his Cabinet.  In November, Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and, according to a report, the two plan to meet again Jan. 27.  Trump has also fielded numerous calls from a number of world leaders since winning the U.S. presidential election Nov. 8 against his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.         ",1

"Donald Trump wanted to give his supporters a strong reason to support him, and instead he just handed the rest of America a great reason to fight like hell to ensure he never gets elected.At a campaign rally just days before a crucial primary day that could decide whether Trump gets the nomination before the convention or not, he told his followers that if he loses, he ll go into hiding, never to be seen again.Signalling yet again that he would not be willing to support another Republican should he lose the nomination, Trump said there was nothing sadder than watching a losing candidate grovel at the feet of the victor. Which, to be fair, is true if the victor is Donald Trump.Clearly not a fan of Ted Cruz, Trump suggested he would never go on to endorse him: They fight like hell for six months, and they re saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine. And then one of them loses, one of them wins. And the one who loses says,  I just want to congratulate my opponent. He is a brilliant man, he ll be a great governor or president or whatever. So Trump made his supporters a promise: I m not sure you re ever going to see me there. I don t think I m going to lose, but if I do, I don t think you re ever going to see me again, folks. I think I ll go to Turnberry and play golf or something. It s bad enough that Trump is already playing the sore loser, but his gambit is almost sure to backfire. It s been well documented that Trump is despised at almost surreal levels. His unpopularity among nearly every demographic is so staggering that it s amazing he s made it this far. The sheer level of loathing people have for Donald Trump may be the one thing that can truly unite the country. He s hated by Hispanics. He s hated by women. He s hated by African Americans. He s hated by young people. He s hated by the one group the GOP could always count on, white men (yes, really).He s the most hated politician in three decades. The last person who came close? Richard Nixon post-Watergate. Even Dick Cheney   at the lowest moments of the Bush years   was hated by (slightly) fewer people.That s a massive number of people who would all but run to the polls if it meant Donald Trump never shows his face in front of a camera again. It s hard to imagine a better way Donald Trump could Make America Great Again than that. And Trump just promised to do it.The stakes in this election, already very high, just became: President Trump vs. Trump never being seen again. Pray America makes the right choice.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",0
"Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was fired by Donald Trump when she refused to defend his travel ban, which we all know is nothing more than a Muslim ban. On Tuesday, she explained to attendees at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado why it was that she couldn t bring herself to argue that this bill wasn t based on religion. I came ultimately to the conclusion that our defending this travel ban would require me to send lawyers of the Justice Department to court to say this ban had nothing to do with religion   (that) it was all based on national security, nothing to do with religion,  Yates told the audience. And I did not believe that to be a defense that was grounded in truth and I couldn t send Department of Justice lawyers in to defend something based on a defense that I did not believe was grounded in truth. The Trump administration did not consult the Justice Department while crafting the ban and Yates didn t even know about it until she got a call from her principal deputy who had read about it in the New York Times. That was on a Friday evening. She studied the bill as much as she could over the weekend and then convened a meeting with  lifetime civil department staffers, holdover employees from President Obama s time in office and newly-hired Trump staff.  Her question to them was simple: How would you defend Trump s travel ban? We went around the table with my asking them,  All right, tell me why you think this is lawful? How are we going to defend this?'  Yates said.  Without revealing our internal discussions here, at the end of that, I was not comfortable that it was, in fact, lawful or constitutional and kept the senior Trump appointee back to tell him I was very uncomfortable where we were. After speaking to several other people about the Muslim ban, Yates said she just couldn t defend it. So, Trump fired her like he fires anybody who doesn t kiss his a** and tell him that he can do no wrong. Nevertheless, she persisted.Watch Sally Yates explain why she couldn t say Trump s Muslim ban was anything other than just that, a Muslim ban, here:1/  That s how we found out about it at @TheJusticeDept:Read abt it on the internet.   @SallyQYates talks #TravelBan pic.twitter.com/xTHWJHHULQ  Josh Weinberger (@kitson) June 27, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",0

"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The final opinion poll before New Zealand s election on Saturday showed the ruling National Party s lead over the opposition Labour Party had slipped to 8.5 points, meaning minor parties could well decide who forms the next government.  The Newshub-Reid survey released on Thursday showed support for Prime Minister Bill English s National Party had edged down 1.5 points to 45.8 percent, but support for Labour also fell, dropping 0.5 points to 37.3 percent. The National Party has governed for the past nine years, and its re-election would hearten investors who favour continuity and like National s vow to keep the small trading economy open to foreign investment. Regardless of the polls, which have shown sharp divergences, the nationalist New Zealand First Party could well emerge as the kingmaker in the next parliament. Minor parties often have an outsize role in New Zealand s proportional representation system, in which a party, or combination of parties, needs 61 of Parliament s 120 members - usually about 48 percent of the vote - to form a government. The Newshub-Reid survey showed support for New Zealand First hitting 7.1 percent, as did support for the Green Party, which is a likely coalition partner for Labour. The tight race, with Labour and the Green Party virtually neck-and-neck with National, meant the government might not be known for weeks.  Despite all of the volatility, despite all the twists and turns of the campaign, it has come back to that simple fact ... New Zealand First appears to be that crucial kingmaker,  said Bryce Edwards, analyst at Wellington-based Critical Politics.   Outspoken New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has said he will not confirm which bloc of parties he ll support until October 12 when the results become official.  The election was so hotly-contested that the deciding votes might be those of overseas New Zealanders, whose ballots would not be released until Oct. 7.  These votes, as well as those from New Zealanders who voted outside of their home area, accounted for around 12 percent of total ballots cast in the 2014 election, according to the Election Commission. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday that citizens living in Australia, home to New Zealand s largest diaspora, were  very important  to the election.  Most New Zealanders maintain a strong interest in the direction of the country, particularly when it comes to things like how we re grappling with international issues, trade issues, environmental issues - so please have your say,  Ardern told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The New Zealand dollar - the word s 11th most traded currency in 2016 - briefly firmed to $0.7324 from $0.7312 after Thursday s opinion poll, but quickly gave up most of those gains and sank to $0.7305.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will propose new cabinet level U.S.-Japan talks on trade, security and macroeconomic issues, including currencies, when he meets U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday, a Japanese government official involved in planning the summit said. Abe heads to Washington later on Thursday hoping promises to help create U.S. jobs and bolster Japan’s military will persuade Trump to turn down the heat on trade and currency and stand by the decades-old alliance. “In a situation in which security relations in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly severe, it is very important to demonstrate the unshakeable U.S.-Japan alliance at home and abroad,” Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. “This is the most important theme of the U.S.-Japan leaders summit,” he said, adding it was also vital to have constructive discussions on how to create a “win-win” relationship by further strengthening U.S.-Japan economic ties. Trump has lumped Japan with China and Mexico as big contributors to the U.S. trade deficit, targeted its auto trade as “unfair” and accused Tokyo of using monetary policy to devalue its currency to boost exports. “We use monetary easing, fiscal policy and structural reform in order to escape from deflation. We don’t engage in competitive currency devaluation or target specific levels,”    Masahiko Shibayama, an adviser to the premier, told Reuters. “We’ll explain based on the fact that Japanese automakers are contributing to U.S. jobs through their local subsidiaries.” During his election campaign, Trump complained Tokyo was not sharing enough of the cost of the U.S. security umbrella although his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, assured Japan the alliance was firm when he visited the country last week.  Abe, who will be accompanied by Finance Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, will bring a package of steps Tokyo says could create 700,000 U.S. jobs through private-public investment in infrastructure such as high-speed trains, government sources say. Trump, who abandoned the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact championed by his predecessor Barack Obama and Abe as a counterweight to a rising China, has made clear he wants a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with Tokyo instead. Abe has left the door open to FTA talks but Japanese officials worry such negotiations would boost pressure on politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture while yielding few economic benefits for Japan. The new cabinet level talks, the government official told Reuters, would be a way of buying time rather than opening FTA talks at an early stage.  Tokyo and Washington already have a cabinet-level mechanism for security talks, the so-called “2-plus-2” meetings of defense and foreign ministers. The new economic framework will be headed by Aso, who is also deputy prime minister, and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, and would address a range of issues, with a focus on crafting trade policies and measures to bolster U.S. employment, said a report in the Nikkei business daily. Abe is likely to propose crafting highly liberal rules for trade and investment in areas such as intellectual property protection, rules of origin, regulations on state-owned companies and e-commerce, the Nikkei said. Japan hopes such bilateral rules would be similar to those agreed upon in the TPP and could be extended to cover the Asia-Pacific region to counter China’s growing clout, it added. The two nations are also preparing statements regarding economic cooperation and security to be issued after the summit meeting, the Nikkei said.  Abe and Trump will also play a round of gold in Florida this weekend after the meeting at the White House on Friday and Trump said he will make sure the Japanese leader is his partner in the game, rather than a competitor.

"Berlin (Reuters) - Five top German politicians received envelopes on Thursday that contained threatening letters and a white powder the letters said was anthrax, which turned out to be harmless, Berlin police said.

" Duterte takes clear lead in Philippine elections. (Photo: IBT)Andrew Korybko The DuranMay 2016: As Filipinos choose their next President on Monday, prospect of election of anti-establishment candidate threatens the geopolitical viability of the US s Pivot to Asia.The Philippines votes for its next President on Monday.  Whilst the rest of the world pays little attention, strategists in Washington are worried.The electoral frontrunner is Rodrigo Duterte, an eccentric, no-nonsense former mayor from the southern island of Mindanao who commands a Trump-like popularity and an equally loyal following. He has shaken Philippine politics to its core over the past couple of months, defying establishment pundits who   just as they did with Trump   wrongly predicted that his campaign would fizzle out over the course of each passing week.Having totally underestimated just how dissatisfied most Filipinos are with the status quo, Duterte s rivals missed the chance to outshine him by his anti-system rhetoric. With the race in its final days that is now too late.  Instead   also paralleling what happened with Trump   there are desperate calls for coalitions and deals to stop him.Should these fail and should Duterte win on Monday, he promises a geopolitical revolution unlike anything the Philippines has ever seen in its history. Pivoting To Asia Through The PhilippinesThe US s Pivot to Asia was announced by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the fall of 2011 with the unstated but obvious goal of  containing  China. Key to this strategy is the  rebalancing    as the Pentagon calls it   of an estimated 60% of its overseas forces to the Asia-Pacific theatre. Such a major deployment requires many more bases than the US currently has in the region. The US has therefore sought the help of the loyal leader of its former Philippines colony, Benigno Aquino III, to find a way to re-open its bases in the Philippines which under popular pressure were closed in the 1990s.Using the  China threat  as the  plausibly justifiable  reason for doing so, but aware that the Philippines people still resent their former coloniser and are proud of having forced the US to close its Philippines bases at the end of the Cold War, the US has devised what it calls an  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement  (EDCA) that allows for the  rotational presence  of American troops in at least five separate bases, one of which is located on the strategic island of Palawan that abuts the South China Sea.Although not legally  permanent  or  officially  controlled by the US, this wink-and-a-nod arrangement would in reality allow the US to redeploy its forces to the Philippines, returning the Philippines archipelago to the role of the US s second  unsinkable aircraft carrier  (alongside Japan) which it had during the Cold War.The  China Containment Coalition The Pentagon plans to use the Philippines as the maritime lynch of its  China Containment Coalition  (CCC), gathering all of its allies  navies together and deploying them within provocative striking range of China s claimed islands.The other three members of the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue   Japan, India, and Australia   would find their own way to  rotate  their military units throughout the Philippines islands as well, thereby forming the core of the CCC.To add a regional element to this mix, the plan is for the Philippines and Vietnam, both of which contest some of China s maritime claims, to intensify their strategic cooperation to the point of a mutual defence treaty. This would draw Vietnam into the network of the anti-China coalition being built up by Washington by using the defence ties between Vietnam and the Philippines to making the members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue de facto allies of Vietnam.Altogether, the Pentagon plan is to produce a critical mass of hostile states near China s southern maritime border which backed by the US could quickly  counter  any moves by Beijing thereby  containing  it to the East Asian mainland.Duterte s RevolutionEverything was proceeding according to plan until Duterte began to question the  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement . While his running mate has said Duterte would honour the agreement, he added that he would do so  from a position of strength .Back in October 2014, Duterte went on record to say the  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement  should be scrapped if it allowed US servicemen in the Philippines to avoid justice for any crimes they committed.This pinpoints an issue very sensitive for Filipinos who have vivid memories of how US troops were able to escape punishment for acts of gross misbehaviour whilst the US military occupied its bases in the Philippines.  Public anger over this issue was one of the key factors in mobilising local opposition to the bases and explains why many Filipinos oppose their return.Since it is impossible to imagine such an incident not arising at some point, it is all but inevitable that a situation will occur which will fulfil Duterte s criterion for scrapping the  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement  Taken together with Duterte s assertion that he intends to deal with the US  from a position of strength  it is easy to see how this might trigger the process of revoking the agreement.No Filipino politician has previously spoken about the US in this way.  Moreover other things he has said also suggest an intention to send a strongly independent line.Not surprisingly the Pentagon-affiliated publication  Starts and Stripes , which writes for US servicemen servicemen and their families, published a scathing critique of Duterte just last week.  Here are some excerpts: With Filipinos set to choose among five candidates on May 9, Duterte, the incumbent mayor of Davao City who has said the U.S.  should not meddle in our affairs,  holds a strong lead, according to the most recent poll released Sunday.Duterte is very popular now because people are sick and tired of the same old, same old,  said Virginia Bacay Watson, a professor at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu.  He s kind of a fresh face, fresh perspective, compared to the other elites who are running. Duterte has presented himself to voters as a straight-talker who is not part of the Manila elite   someone who can get things done even if he needs to bend the rules to do so. That includes the country s foreign affairs. He feels that American influence is too strong, that we re too dependent on U.S. intervention in anything we do,  said Babe Romualdez, an opinion columnist for The Philippine Star newspaper who has interviewed the candidates one-on-one about their platforms on the U.S. military and relations with China. He was an activist when he was a student and young lawyer,  Romualdez said.  I get a sense that he s saying the same things that most of the militants say. In Romualdez s interview with the front-runner, the candidate said  we really don t need the Americans to deal with the Chinese because the Chinese want to talk to us alone. If I become president I m going to reach out to the Chinese and talk to them alone without American intervention,  he said.Duterte publically opposed the Visiting Forces Agreement with the U.S.   of which the EDCA was an amendment   and claimed in 2013 that he had rejected a request by the U.S. to establish Davao as a base of operations for drones.Earlier this year, he was quoted saying that although the country was now bound by the EDCA, he had  reservations about the presence of foreign troops.  He added,  We will not allow the building of structures. Clearly, Duterte is not the sort of leader the Pentagon envisaged for the Philippines.   If he becomes Philippine President there will inevitably be concern in Washington that its elaborate plans for an anti-Chinese coalition in the region could be scuttled.The New Silk Road Pays A Pit Stop To The PhilippinesWorse still for the US Duterte is saying the Philippines and China could have peaceful and pragmatic relations with each other, engaging in bilateral dialogue over their disputes without the meddling interference of the US.What that would mean for the US is that the Philippines might become a tacit Chinese ally, which would completely upend the regional strategic balance.That is not what Duterte is actually calling for, but he did say is that he not only would be open to talking to Beijing, but would even further and engage in joint exploration in the South China Sea. Further, in seeking to develop the decades-neglected infrastructure of one of the most promising economies of Asia, Duterte has suggested that he would be open to inviting China to build a railroad and other types of connective projects that Beijing has become globally renowned for. This would of course mean replacing US contractors   traditionally heavily entrenched in the Philippines   with cheaper and possibly more efficient Chinese ones   potentially causing US companies to lose out from billions of dollars of construction deals.Joint maritime exploration and infrastructure cooperation between the Philippines and China has the potential to turn the entire Philippines archipelago into the latest pit stop for China s New Silk Road, presenting the US with its biggest geopolitical setback since the reunification of Crimea with Russia.Concluding ThoughtsThe entire future of the US s Pivot to Asia hangs in the balance as Filipinos go to the polls in what is shaping up to be the most pivotal election in their country s history.While the US and its allied politicians are preaching a campaign of anti-Chinese fear mongering and war, Rodrigo Duterte is bucking the system and preaching the benefits the Philippines could reap from more pragmatic policies.By questioning the need for the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement and subtly threatening to subvert it, Duterte has made himself the US s enemy number one amongst politicians from the Asia-Pacific. No other individual is speaking out in this way and unlike others who have come before him, he seems to command a high level of genuine people support.If Duterte succeeds in winning the Presidency, it could represent a paradigm shift in Philippine history and the region s geopolitics, resulting in the US losing its second  unsinkable aircraft carrier  and having its Pivot to Asia   ie. its plan to  contain  China   fail before it has even properly got underway.***READ MORE PHILIPPINES NEWS AT 21ST CENTURY WIRE S:  PHILIPPINES FILESSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",0

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it was providing an additional $364 million in humanitarian assistance to help Syrians caught up in the country’s civil war, bringing total U.S. humanitarian spending for Syria to about $5.9 billion. Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration Anne Richard said the funding would help provide food, shelter, safe drinking water, medical care and other support for millions of Syrian refugees and the communities that host them. Richard told a State Department briefing about three-quarters of the additional funding would help people still inside Syria and the rest would assist Syrians who have fled the country. She also said the United States had admitted some 85,000 refugees over the past fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That figure included about 12,500 Syrian refugees, exceeding the administration’s goal of 10,000, she said. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the push for additional humanitarian aid funds came in part because of deteriorating conditions in Aleppo after the collapse of a ceasefire sponsored by the United States and Russia. The forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have launched a massive push against rebel-held areas of the city, where some 250,000 civilians are believed to be trapped. Intensive bombing has killed hundreds of people, many of whom died in buildings collapsed by bunker-buster bombs. “Until the past few weeks we felt like we were on a firm path towards a possible diplomatic resolution to this. We still believe that’s possible,” Toner told a briefing. “That doesn’t mean we’re not mindful ... of the tremendous humanitarian suffering that’s going on right now in Aleppo. And that’s why we’re working so hard to ramp up our assistance,” he added. While saying the United States continued to seek a diplomatic resolution of the problem, he left the door open to other action. “We’ll continue to weigh all options. Those discussions are ongoing. I don’t want to rule anything out, but right now we’re focused on the diplomatic one,” Toner said. He noted the United States has warned that failure to achieve a ceasefire could lead to an escalation of the conflict. “We cannot dictate what other countries ... may or may not decide to do in terms of supporting certain groups within Syria,” Toner said. “You may have a further deterioration on either side ... and by deterioration I mean more arming and more conflict between them, and intensification of the conflict.”  ",1

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved an export license for Ukraine to buy certain light weapons and small arms from U.S. manufacturers, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Wednesday. Department records show Ukraine has bought small amounts of those types of weapons for several years, both before and after the 2014 Russian annexation of Ukraine s Crimean peninsula. The department notified Congress of the decision on Dec. 13, Nauert said, adding that the U.S. government was not selling the weapons directly to the Kiev government but was allowing Ukraine to buy from U.S. manufacturers.   Under the previous two administrations, the U.S. government has approved export licenses to Ukraine, so this is nothing new,  Nauert said. The license covers weapons in categories such as semi-automatic and automatic firearms up to, and including, .50 caliber weapons. It also includes combat shotguns, silencers, military scopes, and flash suppressors, as well as parts. Nauert said the U.S. government had not directly provided lethal defensive equipment to Ukraine, nor had it ruled out doing so. U.S. exporters can apply for direct commercial sales licenses at any time and those are reviewed by the State Department on a case-by-case basis, she said. ",1

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain’s looming exit from the European Union is another huge setback for negotiations on a massive U.S.-EU free trade deal that were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti-trade sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic.  The historic divorce launched by Thursday’s vote will almost certainly further delay substantial progress in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks as the remaining 27 EU states sort out their own new relationship with Britain, trade experts said on Friday.  With French and German officials increasingly voicing skepticism about TTIP’s chances for success, the United Kingdom’s departure from the deal could sink hopes of a deal before President Barack Obama leaves office in January. “This is yet another reason why TTIP will likely be postponed,” said Heather Conley, European program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington. “But to be honest, TTIP isn’t going anywhere, I believe, before 2018 at the earliest,” she said. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement on Friday that he was evaluating the UK decision’s impact on TTIP, but would continue to engage with both European and UK counterparts.     “The importance of trade and investment is indisputable in our relationships with both the European Union and the United Kingdom,” Froman said. “The economic and strategic rationale for T-TIP remains strong.” TTIP negotiators are still expected to meet in Brussels in mid-July as scheduled, but those talks were aimed at focusing on less controversial issues while leaving the thorniest disagreements for U.S. and EU political leaders to resolve. And it is unclear when Britain will launch formal separation proceedings, which will take at least two years. But analysts said both sides have been reluctant to put their best offers on the table with a new U.S. president due to take office in January and French and German leadership elections nearing in 2017. The Brexit also will preoccupy EU officials in coming months as they launch their own negotiations with London over the future terms of UK-EU trade, and sort out their post-Brexit priorities, said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based think tank.     Britain’s departure could leave U.S. negotiators facing a European side that is more dug-in on some issues, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank in Washington. “As the UK is part of the coalition of liberal trading economies in the EU, the U.S. is losing one of the more like-minded countries from the group in Brussels sitting on the other side of the negotiating table,” said Bown, a former World Bank economist. However, Lee-Makiyama, who also sees little chance of a deal before 2018, said Britain’s departure could eliminate one source of disagreement because the UK has insisted on a financial services chapter in the trade deal. “The only real proponent of banking regulation in TTIP is the UK. Germany and France are probably willing to let it go,” he said. “It still leaves about 20 outstanding issues at nearly the same level of difficulty.” The TTIP negotiations, which started three years ago, have unable to settle major differences over agriculture, where the EU side has shown little willingness to alter food safety rules that prohibit American beef raised with hormones or genetically modified foods, or open its closely guarded geographical food naming rules, such as for Asiago and feta cheeses. European negotiators have complained that the United States has offered too little to open up its vast federal, state and local government procurement markets to European vendors with “Buy American” preferences in place. Europe also wants access to key U.S. sectors such as maritime transport and aviation, while American negotiators have been frustrated over lack of access to some 200 European sectors ranging from healthcare to education. The two sides also are far apart on how to resolve disputes. The U.S. side favors a traditional binding arbitration approach, while the Europeans want a court-like system that allows for appeals. More progress has been made on harmonizing regulations for things like car seat belt anchors, clothes labeling and pharmaceutical inspections. ",1

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican soldiers arbitrarily executed two people after an illegal raid last year, a national rights body said on Tuesday, releasing its findings as protests disrupted a debate in the Senate over a contentious bill to give the military more powers. The military, deployed in Mexico s war on drug gangs for over a decade, has been embroiled in several rights scandals including the extrajudicial killings of gang members and the disappearance of 43 students near one of its bases in 2014. The case reported by the National Human Rights Commission on its website on Tuesday related to a raid on a home in the western state of Jalisco last year.  The Commission, chosen by the Senate and autonomous from Mexico s federal government and its president, said the soldiers had tortured and sexually abused people they found there. After arbitrary detention, soldiers killed two of them by breaking their necks, the Commission said. While its rulings are not binding, the Commission s recommendations are influential and require a response from the institutions it reports on.   The timing is awkward for President Enrique Pena Nieto s  government, as it faces widespread criticism over legislation passed in the lower house and now in the Senate that seeks to enshrine in law the use of the military in crime fighting. The United Nations human rights chief on Tuesday called on Mexican lawmakers not to pass the bill, saying Mexico needed a stronger police force. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein said the law did not contain strong enough controls to protect civilians from abuses in Mexico, where extrajudicial killings, torture and disappearances are carried out by both security forces and criminal gangs.  Adopting a new legal framework to regulate the operations of the armed forces in internal security is not the answer. The current draft law risks weakening incentives for the civilian authorities to fully assume their law enforcement roles,  Zeid said in a statement. Protesters successfully blocked discussion of the bill for much of Tuesday, barring access points to the Senate, and laying out placards warning against the militarization of the country while pointing to a massive rise in killings since President Felipe Calderon first put the army on the streets in 2016. In his presidential campaign, Pena Nieto promised to develop a large new national police force, but has ended up relying on military forces for high-profile operations. Murders in Mexico in 2017 are on track to be the worst on record, with 20,878 nationwide in the first 10 months. Lawmakers are expected to push the bill through committees and later put the measure to a full vote on the Senate floor. Lower house lawmakers moved quickly on the bill last week after it had languished in committees for years. The law has broad support from the ruling party and members of the opposition National Action Party who say it will give clear rules limiting the use of soldiers to fight crime.   The law is aimed at avoiding the discretional use of the armed forces by the president,  PAN Senator Roberto Gil Zuarth told reporters.  Right now there are no rules. He doesn t have to tell anybody.  However, rights campaigners worry the law opens the door to military intervention in protests, as well as expanding military powers to spy on citizens.  It is opposed by the party of leftist presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, which has only a handful of senators, but wants to return soldiers to their barracks over time. Julia Klug, 65, an activist from Mexico City protesting outside the Senate with  no violence  written on her face, said the law would entrench the role of the armed forces in a struggle with criminals that was not theirs to fight.  It s the Navy that s committing murder, it s the Army that s carrying out kidnappings. The police was corrupt, but these guys are criminals,  she said holding up a Mexican flag with the eagle at the centre of it spattered in red. ",1
"Iconic liberal news anchor Lawrence O Donnell is clearly not happy   and he has every right to be.Yet again, his  Lean Forward  bosses at MSNBC opted to cut his show so that they could run a live feed of a Donald Trump stump speech. It wasn t  news.  It wasn t even  new.  It was just Donald Trump, up at the podium, saying the kind of disgusting things he always says. MSNBC gave over their network for that. MSNBC silenced one of their star anchors for that.Needless to say, viewers were furious. So too was O Donnell.Because the anchor is in many ways the face of his or her program, many of MSNBC s disgruntled fans took out their frustrating on O Donnell. On Twitter, his account was innundated with negative responses. Many couldn t believe they were watching MSNBC hand over free advertising to Trump. Many just wanted to know why O Donnell wasn t on like they had hoped.Rather than toe the network line and give a weak defense of why Trump just had to be given the air time, O Donnell threw the script away and began sympathizing with his fans.

Joe Adalian (@TVMoJoe) April 29, 2016Like other anchors, O Donnell is rightfully fed up with allowing the tail to wag the dog. Rather than report the news, MSNBC has settled on chasing Trump from campaign event to campaign event in the hopes that viewers will tune in. It s given the Republican candidate unprecedented amounts of free air time. He doesn t even have to spend money on advertising because huge networks give it away for free.And instead of trying to rein in the absurd status quo, MSNBC has shown signs that it will only get worse. Already the network tossed one of their fiercest liberal hosts, Melissa Harris-Perry, because they needed more time for Trump live feeds. They ve recently begun hinting that they will be expanding their conservative morning show, Morning Joe, in an effort to entice both Trump and his fans to check out the network. Host Joe Scarborough is a well known Trump fan making the relationship between the Republican candidate and the network even more inexcusable.Did the media  create  Donald Trump? The answer is complicated. Certainly, Trump s racist and sexist fans were already around, just waiting for a candidate to say all the right things to them. But there can be no question that the media has enabled Trump. Every phone interview. Every campaign rally. Every panel discussion about Trump s  viability  makes Trump s star rise. There is no such thing as bad publicity, and nobody gets publicity   good and bad   like Trump.Kudos to O Donnell for taking a stand against this betrayal of integrity.Featured image via screengrab",0

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump are viewed in Moscow as his official position and read by his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. A prolific user of Twitter before he was elected late last year, Trump has continued to use the social media platform to voice his views on policy and world affairs since moving into the White House. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday it was not his place to comment on Trump s actions, but added:  In any case, everything which is published from his authorised Twitter account is perceived by Moscow as his official statement.  Naturally, it is reported to Putin along with other information about official statements by  politicians,  Peskov said, adding that Putin was not a Twitter user himself. Trump s activity on Twitter have previously cause controversy. His tweets sparked outrage in Britain last month and a sharp rebuke of Prime Minister Theresa May when he retweeted anti Islam videos from a British far-right group. ",1
"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A smiling Donald Trump offered European Union chiefs assurances on security in Brussels on Thursday but EU officials did not conceal lingering differences with the U.S. president over Russia, trade and climate change. “The leaders discussed ... shared challenges in fighting global terrorism,” the White House said in a statement.  “They agreed on the need to work together to deepen our security cooperation in fighting ISIS (Islamic State), combating radicalisation and responding to other common threats.” In talks before a summit of NATO leaders at the Atlantic military alliance’s headquarters across town, an EU source said Trump had also voiced fears that Brexit could cost U.S. jobs — a possible sign of second thoughts on support for the British vote to leave which stunned the bloc.  And Trump also agreed to setting up a joint EU-U.S. “action plan” on trade, in an indication the new occupant of the White House is not as set on shunning free trade deals and promoting protectionism as some in Europe had feared he might. The White House said “the United States and the European Union should deepen our strong economic relationship” and spoke of a need to protect U.S. and EU industries from “unfair competition” — a shared concern coming, notably, from China. Nonetheless, European Council President Donald Tusk indicated, there was less than a meeting of minds on trade and other issues, despite the cordiality of Trump’s welcome. “We agreed on many areas, first and foremost on counter-terrorism,” Tusk said after he and EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker met Trump for over an hour.  “But some issues remain open, like climate and trade.” European leaders have been urging Trump not to abandon the U.S. commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions made when his predecessor Barack Obama signed up to the U.N. Paris accord. Tusk also said he did not feel he and Trump were on exactly the same page in terms of dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, although they agreed on efforts to end conflict in Ukraine which the West blames on Moscow and which has resulted in both EU and U.S. economic sanctions on Russia. A spokeswoman for Juncker, the president of the European Commission which had been negotiating an ambitious free trade deal with Washington known as TTIP before Trump’s upset election victory, said the two sides would work to increase trade. “Intensifying trade cooperation ... is a win-win situation for both sides,” the EU spokeswoman said. “It was agreed to start work on a joint action plan on trade.” Juncker declined comment on whether talks in the coming weeks might revive TTIP. Trump has made clear his dislike of multilateral trade agreements, pulling out of the TPP agreement with Asian states. However, European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have suggested he is warming to trade talks with the EU, which unifies trade rules for all 28 states. Trump irritated EU leaders during his election campaign last year by hailing Brexit and suggesting other countries might follow Britain out of the 28-nation bloc. Eurosceptic leaders said he would offer Britain a free trade deal once it left. However, EU officials believe Trump has come to appreciate more since taking office the value of European integration to U.S. interests. U.S. businesses have taken advantage of its single market to reduce the costs of exporting to Europe. An EU source said Trump had told Tusk and Juncker he was now worried that Americans may lose jobs as a result of Britain leaving the EU in 2019: He “expressed concern that jobs in the U.S. would be lost because of Brexit”, the source said. EU officials said the meeting had been constructive and friendly. Tusk and Juncker joked with Trump about the EU having “two presidents” and being “too complicated”. The U.S. leader appeared to mix the two of them up during remarks in January, deepening concerns in Brussels that the reality TV star in the White House failed to take the European Union seriously. Trump waxed lyrical about his first foreign trip, which has offered distraction to ethics questions at home, notably over alleged campaign ties to Russia. Pope Francis is “terrific”, Trump told Tusk and Juncker, and his welcome in Saudi Arabia was “beyond anything anyone’s ever seen”. Tusk, a Communist-era dissident who once listed Trump among risks to the world order alongside Russia, China and Islamist violence, said he had tried to impress on the billionaire U.S. president a need for Transatlantic cooperation to promote “values” like human rights and not just selfish “interests”. The White House said the meeting had “reaffirmed the strong bond between the United States and Europe, anchored in shared values and longstanding friendship.” ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton’s vow to regulate oil and gas fracking almost out of existence was met with skepticism Monday, failing to convince either industry or environment groups that she would - or could - end the controversial drilling practice if she becomes president. The front-runner for the Democratic party nomination used a debate in Flint, Michigan on Sunday night to oppose fracking anywhere local communities were against it, wherever it polluted air or water, and whenever companies refused to disclose what chemicals they use in the process.   “By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place,” she said. But supporters and opponents of fracking dismissed her position as campaign rhetoric that would collide with the limited powers of a president to control an activity largely regulated at the state level. Defenders of fracking said no president would try to put the brakes on a drilling technique that has flooded the U.S. with cheap oil and gas. “Secretary Clinton’s answer is essentially campaign hyperbole, and meant to appease her environmental constituency,” said Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Texas’ Southern Methodist University, in a blog post in the Dallas Morning News. “In reality, it has little substance to it.” Green groups welcomed Clinton’s shift from her past support for fracking. But they also urged her to stop laying down conditions and caveats. “Clinton will continue to struggle to convince climate advocates that she is serious about addressing the crisis until she comes out for a full ban on fracking,” said Yong Jung Cho, campaign coordinator of grassroots groups 350 Action. As secretary of state, Clinton supported fracking as a way to reduce U.S. dependence on imported energy, and even led a push to spread shale extraction to allies in Europe to wean them off Russian gas.[L1N0VX2JT] Her pledge in Flint to curtail the practice followed the blunt declaration against fracking by Senator Bernard Sanders, her sole rival for the nomination. Sanders’ challenge has shifted some of Clinton’s positions in the campaign, and her statement on fracking now comes closer to wider Democratic party sentiment. “Secretary Clinton has been pushed to the left by Senator Sanders,” said Kathleen Sgamma, vice president of government affairs at the Western Energy Alliance. Sgamma said Democrats from President Barack Obama to Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper support fracking and the economic benefits its brings to many states.  “Sometimes things said in the heat of a debate are later wisely set aside when faced with the economic and national security consequences of shutting down the technique that unlocks huge domestic sources of energy that would otherwise have to come from Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran,” she said. The Clinton campaign said the candidate has previously criticized fracking when it clashed with local opposition. “If a local government says no (to fracking), not here, they should be able to do that,” Clinton said during a campaign stop in Keene, New Hampshire last October. But fracking for natural gas has also drastically reduced the amount of coal being burned to produce electricity, and has been mostly supported by the Obama administration.  David Koranyi, director of the Eurasian Energy Future Initiative at the Atlantic Council said Clinton’s “very circumspect” answer to the question in Flint actually reflected the Obama administration’s current approach to fracking, which  seeks to continue expanding shale production with more environmental oversight. “I believe wrapped in her strong statement is a pragmatic approach that recognizes the merits of natural gas as a bridge fuel in the process of decarbonization,” he said.  Clinton’s harder line did, however, delineate the clear differences between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. All Republican contenders have strongly defended fracking, leading Louis Finkel of the American Petroleum Institute to attack Clinton’s position as “a political stunt by those who are spouting populist rhetoric for political points.” The importance of fracking to the American economy, he said, means the Democrats “are not being honest with American voters.”  (Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Bernard Orr) This article was funded in part by SAP.

McCain told a hearing on the issue that he and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy would introduce the legislation on Thursday, the first of many actions planned “to ensure we end our dependence on Russian rocket engines and stop subsidizing Vladimir Putin and his gang of corrupt cronies.” McCain vowed to do “everything in my power” to ban future use of the engines, which power the Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.

"President Obama made what was billed as an economic speech in Elkhart, Indiana but in reality it was his first speech of the presidential campaign and was a preview of the sort of case he will make against Donald Trump this fall.Obama made it clear he was speaking about Trump, telling the crowd,  If we fall for a bunch of okeydoke just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative then we re not going to build on the progress that we started. Echoing the speaking style that led him to back-to-back presidential victories, Obama picked apart, step by step, many of the Republican complaints about his administration.Obama told the crowd he would do some  mythbusting,  to loud applause. He pointed out that Donald Trump s claim that other countries are  killing us on trade  and that immigrants are taking American jobs are just completely myths. He also explained that he wanted to  bust this myth of crazy liberal government spending  hurting economic growth.He pointed out that in nearly every measure of the economy, compared to how it was before he came into office, things are much improved.The White House released a series of tweets and graphs pointing out over and over how his leadership has transformed the economy for the better: Over the past six years, our businesses have created more than 14 million new jobs.""  @POTUS in Elkhart pic.twitter.com/BYknKBnaa0  The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 1, 2016 For the first time ever, more than ninety percent of the country has health insurance.   @POTUS on Elkhart pic.twitter.com/MsHaN1fnHh  The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 1, 2016 Our deficits haven t grown these past seven and a half years; we ve cut them by almost 75%.   @POTUS pic.twitter.com/k24EI0FGQ6  The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 1, 2016Obama also pointed out that Republicans have been wrapped up  this cult of small government,  when in reality the government has a role to play in helping to keep the economy going.

Obama noted,  It s not a coincidence that as union membership shrank, inequality grew and wages stagnated .  He added,  America shouldn t be changing our laws to make it harder for workers to organize.

"Do you think our Gun Grabber In Chief should be next?Virginia state senator Bill Carrico (R-Dist. 40) is responding to Governor Terry McAuliffe s (D) relentless gun control push by introducing a budget amendment to remove funding for McAuliffe s protection detail.Carrico said,  If he s so afraid of guns, then I m not going to surround him with armed state policemen. McAuliffe has pushed numerous gun controls as governor and, in August, infamously pushed for expanding background checks after Virginia reporter Alison Parker had been shot on air. McAuliffe made the push for expanded background checks before the gunman who killed Parker had been caught and, therefore, before he had any knowledge of how the gunman acquired his gun. As it turned out, gunman Vester Lee Flanagan acquired his gun via a background check.Moreover, on October 15, McAuliffe issued an executive order banning the open carry of firearms in state buildings used by the Virginia executive branch and calling for enforcement to ensure that the only people  in the business  of selling guns in Virginia are those with a Federal Firearm License (FFL).Senator Carrico is responding to these things and more by trying to be sure McAuliffe does not have to be around guns at all if they bother him so much. According to the Bristol Herald Courier, Carrico said he will address this matter when the General Assembly convenes in January, saying:A lot of the governor s power is deferred to the General Assembly at that point and I ll be getting with my colleagues to circumvent everything this governor has done on this point. I have a budget amendment that I m looking at to take away his executive protection unit. If he s so afraid of guns, then I m not going to surround him with armed state policemen.

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A Swiss man was handed a suspended prison term of nearly two years and a fine on Thursday for spying on a German tax authority, in a case that has pitted Swiss bank secrecy against Germany s clampdown on tax evasion. The penalty was relatively modest as spying for a foreign state is punishable in Germany by up to five years in prison, but the Frankfurt court said the man, identified only as Daniel M., had no prior convictions and had made a full confession. Daniel M., 54, had tried to get the personal contact details of German tax officials for Swiss intelligence, which wanted to prosecute them for obtaining secret bank data. German states including the one in question, North Rhine-Westphalia, have over the past few years gotten hold of CDs containing details of bank accounts held secretly in Switzerland by Germans hoping to avoid tax. Swiss authorities say this amounts to the theft of business secrets, while German officials say they are combating illegal tax evasion. Lawyers for Daniel M., whose spying activities lasted from 2011 until 2015, had argued that their client was simply a  patriot  caught between two ideologies. The court, which handed him a suspended prison term of a year and 10 months and a fine of 40,000 euros ($46,392), acknowledged that he had suffered considerable financial damage since being detained in Frankfurt in May. But it also criticized his cooperation with Swiss intelligence over a period of at least two and a half years.  The depiction of the defendant s actions as those of a Swiss patriot did not convince the court, especially because tax evasion, the reason for the tax officials  actions, is not considered morally protected behavior in Switzerland either,  the court said in a statement. The Swiss Banking Act requires employees of Swiss-regulated banks to keep client information confidential, but a number of staff have leaked account details to foreign authorities in the past decade as Western governments crack down on tax evasion. Whistleblowers and new disclosure standards have proven costly for Swiss banks, which have suffered hundreds of billions of dollars in outflows as a result. Over a third of Swiss private banks have permanently closed.     ",1
"SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. ",1
"At this point, the arguments against the #AllLivesMatter crowd s rebuttal against the #BlackLivesMatter movement have been well documented. The point that  Just because someone says  Save the rainforest  does not mean that they are saying  F*ck all other forests  should have ended the debate. However, the debate continues. One person on twitter saw the connection between the #AllLivesMatter and the recent sale of the gun George Zimmerman used to kill Trayvon Martin.Here s the tweet:It should be noted that the gun actually sold for $250,000 dollars but that does not change the point at all.There have been no major systemic changes to the institutions that have racism built into their core. Since the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement, it has been proven again and again just how much it is needed.Many people have claimed that the gun is a piece of history and that s why people are willing to pay so much money for it. I have to wonder if the person who bought the gun would also be willing to pay a quarter of a million dollars for the hoodie that Trayvon Martin was wearing the night he was killed by Zimmerman. I highly doubt that they or most of the people who put serious bids in for the weapon would be willing to do so. Especially when it is taken into account that at least part of the money Zimmerman will receive, will be donated to groups that fight the Black Lives Matter movement.That s because the gun isn t just a piece of history. It is a trophy for white supremacists. It is a symbol that a grown man can kill an unarmed black teenager, be protected by the state s legal system, and then go on to make a fortune off of the tragedy that person has caused.Featured Image Photo by Joe Burbank-Pool/Getty Images",0
"At 11 AM Tuesday morning, FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI would NOT be recommending the Democratic presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton be charged with a crime in relation to her mishandling of government emails while she was Secretary of State.Comey first spent several minutes explaining how the FBI carefully and comprehensively went through the multiple servers Clinton used during her time at the State Department. The FBI went through all of the emails she provided as well through emails received by people she was in contact with. They even reconstructed as many deleted personal emails as they could from her hard drives. Think of the super cool scenes in Hollywood movies where hackers recover deleted emails except it s a really long and tedious process.A lot of people have been praying and hoping that the FBI would find a smoking gun and for a few minutes, it seemed like they had when Comey announced that they had found 3 emails with classified information: 1 at the secret level and 2 at the confidential levels (secret is a higher classification than confidential).However, Comey also explained that there was absolutely no evidence that those emails had been deleted as an attempt to cover anything up. He even explained the process by which her lawyers would have unintentionally deleted emails they should have turned over. This may sound like he was defending Clinton but he was simply explaining the process that led the FBI to their conclusions that no criminal actions were taken.Comey also explained that while there is no direct evidence that Hillary s servers were hacked, they were definitely at risk and there is no way to know that they weren t hacked because of the way the system was set up. That might sound like splitting hairs but it s an important distinction. If the proper precautions had been taken, it would have been easier to definitively know if something had happened.Comey went on to tear the State Department a new one over their  extremely careless  handling of classified material but finally got to the FBI s recommendation:In our system, the prosecutors makes the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evident the FBI helps collect. Although we don t normally make public our recommendation to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversation with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order.Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, out judgement is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.Comey also said,  We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. This doesn t necessarily end the saga of Hillary s emails as the Department of Justice could still decide to press charges anyway, although it s unclear what they would hope to accomplish given the lack of evidence. The most likely outcome is that Donald Trump just lost his best chance at defeating Hillary and after a few weeks of him bellowing that the fix was in, no one will remember what all the drama was about.Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images",0

"Don t you just love the absolute boldness of the Mexican government in this move to charge people coming across their border in Tijuana? Unreal!Walking into Mexico at the nation s busiest border crossing with the United States is no longer an uninterrupted stroll for foreigners.Starting late Wednesday, pedestrians going to Tijuana from San Diego at the San Ysidro crossing must choose between a line for Mexicans who get waved through, and a line for foreigners who must show a passport, fill out a form and   if staying more than a week   pay 322 pesos, or roughly $20, for a six-month permit.About a dozen foreigners stood in line Wednesday night, directed by English-speaking agents to six inspection booths where they got passports stamped.

"HANOI (Reuters) - A top U.S. envoy began a two-day trip to Vietnam on Monday to gauge its progress in human rights, two weeks ahead of a visit by President Barack Obama in what will be the first by a U.S. leader in a decade. Tom Malinowski, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, is expected to press Vietnam to release unconditionally political prisoners and reform its laws to comply with its international commitments. Relations between the United States and Vietnam have moved to a new level in the past two years as Washington seeks to make a new ally in Asia, but the communist nation’s zero-tolerance approach to its detractors remains a sticking point. Vietnam has jailed dissidents, bloggers and religious figures in recent years, holding them for long periods without access to family or legal counsel and often subject to torture or other mistreatment, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. The United States has been intensifying efforts in building stronger ties -  in health, education, environment, energy and recently military - to boost its influence, and offset that of China. The United States and Vietnam, along with 10 others, this year signed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the world’s biggest multinational trade deals. Though the TPP has no requirements for members to reach certain standards in human rights, analysts say Vietnam’s record of arrests, intimidation and oppression of those who speak out against the ruling Communist Party could add to anticipated resistance to the pact among U.S. legislators. The TPP must be ratified by each member country’s parliament. Malinowski said during his visit to Vietnam last year that he had seen signs of progress on human rights but the country needed to make a stronger commitment. Rights groups, however, say those improvements might be short-lived and designed to ensure its smooth accession to multilateral trade agreements, including a pact with the European Union. ",1
"A cowardly Republican gave a racist excuse for why he doesn t want to face his constituents at a town hall.As angry Americans show up to town halls to give their Republican representatives hell over their obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act, an Illinois Republican has decided that he doesn t care about his constituents enough to take criticism from them in person.Rep. Mike Bost has been largely ducking his constituents by holding tele-town halls that they aren t informed about until the last minute, which means not a lot of people are able to participate. Those that do are dedicated supporters who will agree with everything Bost says without any push back whatsoever. The in-person ones going on around the United States right now are out of control, which means you don t actually get to talk to people and listen, and we re looking for ways to do that,  Bost told The Southern Illinoisan.And then Bost made a racist comparison to describe the angry people who are attending town halls. The amount of time that I have at home is minimal, I need to make sure that it s productive. You know the cleansing that the Orientals used to do where you d put one person out in front and 900 people yell at them? That s not what we need. We need to have meetings with people that are productive. I m not going to have the public town hall meetings, in that respect, because I am busy trying to work on the issue,  Bost continued.  If all you want to do is stand and yell at me   we re not going back and forth. What Bost wants is a town hall where he won t be criticized and won t have to answer the criticism. You know, because Bost and Republicans like him are snowflakes who want to pretend that everyone likes them and what they are doing in Congress.Republicans know that repealing the Affordable Care Act is getting more and more unpopular as their own constituents begin to realize that they will lose their own healthcare.To explain the anger at town halls, Republicans have falsely portrayed their own constituents as out-of-state paid protesters rather than admit that they are wrong to repeal the landmark healthcare program.But as Republicans continue to duck their voters they will only make them angrier in the long run. When the 2018 midterm election comes around they won t be able to avoid the voice of the people then. And they will discover quickly that they made a huge mistake by not facing their constituents when they had a chance.Featured image via St. Louis Public Radio",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday voted to advance legislation instructing committees to write legislation repealing President Barack Obama’s landmark healthcare law. The procedural vote of 235 to 188 clears the way for a vote later on Friday to pass the measure to begin work on repealing Obamacare that already has been approved by the Senate. It strictly followed party lines, indicating solidarity among House Republicans on the issue. ",1
"Project Veritas  newest video from the American Pravda: CNN series exposes Jimmy Carr, the Associate Producer for CNN s New Day attacking President Donald Trump and admitting that CNN has a left-leaning bias. When asked by an undercover journalist if CNN is impartial, Carr plainly responded,  In theory. We reported on the previous videos from Project Veritas: James O Keefe s Project Veritas reporters went undercover at CNN to investigate the #VeryFakeNews network to determine the motivation behind CNN s Trump-Russia collusion obsession. Since the inauguration, CNN has mentioned  Russian story  nearly 16,000 times.Project Veritas  reporters can be seen in the video below having a conversation with CNN s supervising producer John Bonifield. The reporter talked to Bonifield first about the constant barrage of Trump-Russia stories on CNN. Bonifield admitted that although CNN has no evidence or proof of Trump involvement with Russia, they continue to make it their top story on CNN simply for  ratings  and to  make money.  Bonifield has worked as a journalist and as a producer for nearly 15 years at CNN, making him a pretty reliable source when it comes to how things work at CNN.Bonifield actually confessed to the undercover Project Veritas journalist that President Trump is correct when he says the media is on a  witch hunt  to take him down. Bonifield told the reporter:  I think the President is right to say, like, look you are  witch hunting me  You have no real smoking gun, you have no proof. Bonifield told the undercover reporter for Project Veritas that CNN is biased and is playing to their audience by attacking President Trump, and actually admitted that  Trump is good for business right now.  The Project Veritas reporter asked Bonifield,  But honestly, you think the whole Russia shit is bullshit?  to which Bonifield replied:  Could be bullshit. I mean, it s mostly bullshit right now. Like, we don t have any big, giant proof. The way these leaks happen, they d leak it. It d leak. If it was something really good, it would leak. Watch the unbelievable video here:Did the three resignations that took place at CNN today have anything to do with the impending release of O Keefe s explosive video proving that CNN manufactures Trump-Russia collusion stories for ratings, or for money?The story about the three CNN employees resigning for publishing fake news broke yesterday. Is ti a coincidence that today, O Keefe released this explosive bombshell video?Here s the story that broke yesterday: CNN employees have resigned for their role in pushing fake news about the Trump-Russia story that claimed a member of the Trump transition team was under investigation.Reporter Thomas Frank, editor Eric Lichtblau and executive editor Lex Haris all resigned from their positions following a company-wide investigation into the single-sourced story that was quickly debunked, The Washington Post first reported. CNN quickly followed up with a story of their own on the resignations. Lichtblau reportedly oversaw the false story, while Haris headed up CNN s investigative unit. In the aftermath of the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story s publication,  CNN s coverage quotes a company spokesman as saying.Philly.com   On Thursday evening, CNN investigative reporter Thomas Frank published a potentially explosive report involving an investigation of a Russian investment fund with potential ties to several associates of President Donald Trump.But by Friday night, the story was removed from CNN s website and all links were scrubbed from the network s social media accounts. That story did not meet CNN s editorial standards and has been retracted,  CNN said in an editors note posted in place of the story.  Links to the story have been disabled. ",0
"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech billionaire businessman Andrej Babis s ANO party held a 20-point lead in a parliamentary election on Saturday, with over half of all voting stations reporting results, giving his party an unassailable position in talks to form the next government.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - They voted to “drain the swamp” in Washington, D.C., but on the night before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, they came to wallow in it. At parties across the city, Trump supporters danced and drank to celebrate an incoming president that they said would shake up a city that they saw as corrupt, complacent and out of touch with the rest of America. “Washington is freaked out. They’re about to lose power,” said John Workman, a former mayor of Palm Beach Shores, Florida, as a pair of costumed robots danced to “Sweet Home Alabama.” Ironically, Workman and other Trump supporters were participating in a Washington ritual as old as the city itself - the crush of balls, parties and protests that mark the inauguration of a new U.S. president. Trump takes office after a bitter presidential campaign marked by allegations of sexual harassment, race baiting and foreign hacking, and some of the parties were apparently as divisive as the president-elect himself. Outside the DeploraBall, a gathering of tech-savvy Trump backers who take pride in offending liberals, several hundred protesters shouted obscenities as they squared off with riot police on the streets.  Police deployed chemical spray after protesters threw trash at those leaving the building, according to the Washington Post. Elsewhere in the city, Trump backers wearing American flag-themed apparel and red “Make America Great Again” hats shared sidewalks with people carrying signs that called the incoming president a fascist.  Helicopters roared overhead as a pickup truck towing a “Honk 4 Trump” trailer blared the 1971 Don MacLean hit “American Pie.” Trump himself has struggled to attract top-level talent for the festivities, settling on lesser known acts like Three Doors Down for a concert at the Lincoln Memorial earlier in the day. He wasn’t the only one with problems. The Garden State party had to scramble for entertainment after a Bruce Springsteen tribute band canceled on the New Jersey-themed event, saying the artist whose songs they played would not approve. That didn’t seem to phase Trump, who made an appearance at a candlelight dinner for donors in Union Station, promising “four incredible years” and bragging about his surprise November victory.  “I think I outworked anybody who ever ran for office,” he said. Across town, the New York Society ball could boast rare bipartisan bona fides as the home state of both Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. “If Hillary had won, all this would still happen,” said Brenda Alford, 59, who was dressed in a gold skirt and a gold silk top as a tribute to Trump’s gilded Manhattan residence. A Trump supporter, she bought tickets before the Nov. 8 election. Held at the Fairmont Hotel, which recently completed a $27 million renovation, the party featured a giant Teddy Roosevelt mascot, celebrity host Joe Piscopo, and political figures from both parties. Several Republicans at the ball confided that they were not in town to celebrate Trump’s victory as much as they were to celebrate the end of Democratic President Barack Obama’s term, and, above all, have a good time.   To some partygoers, the soiree lacked a certain energy.  “If Trump were here he would be disappointed with the lack of ladies on the dance floor,” said James Koutoulas, a tuxedo-clad hedge fund owner from Florida, as he nursed a vodka tonic. Indeed, the dance floor was largely free of dancers, female or otherwise, until the band struck up a version of Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline.”  As the party picked up, Koutoulas mused about how Trump’s freewheeling style might affect his profits as a hedge fund manager.     “I’m a CEO. Everyone is terrified of what a Trump tweet could do to their bottom line,” he said.  “The terror is being used for good — so far.” ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate unanimously backed President Barack Obama’s nomination of Eric Fanning as secretary of the Army on Tuesday, making him the first openly gay leader of a U.S. military service branch. Fanning was previously undersecretary of the Air Force and chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Fanning was confirmed by unanimous voice vote, eight months following his nomination, after Senator Pat Roberts said Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told him that it was now too late for the administration to transfer prisoners from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Roberts’ home state, Kansas. Work did not confirm Roberts’ account of that conversation, saying that no option was off the table. “I explained to Senator Roberts that we are trying to achieve the goal of closure with the support of Congress and we recognize that there is limited time left to achieve that support, both in terms of lifting Congressional restrictions and winning approval of funds to execute closure,” Work said in a statement.  Roberts had held up Fanning’s nomination for months to  underscore his opposition to any possible transfer of detainees. His opposition had frustrated fellow Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a strong supporter of Fanning’s nomination. On Tuesday, McCain and Roberts appeared in the Senate together as Roberts announced that he had released his “hold” on Fanning and spoken to Fanning. McCain noted that this year’s National Defense Authorization Act ensures that the Obama administration does not have the authority to release or transfer Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. mainland. Roberts said Work told him during a meeting last week that he would be unable to fulfill an order to move Guantanamo detainees to the United States before Obama leaves office in January 2017. “The clock has run out for the president,” Roberts said.

"Trump mouthpiece Jeffrey Lord got his a** handed to him by Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night for once again bringing up Juanita Broaddrick in response to sexual assault allegations against the Republican nominee.During the segment, Cooper and the panel were discussing the women who have come forward to tell their stories about how Donald Trump groped them when Lord interrupted to complain that the women didn t talk about Jaunita Broaddrick and her accusations against Bill Clinton, even though Broaddrick has nothing to do with Trump s own behavior.Lord called the women s accusations into question, but Cooper was quick to drop the hammer on his hypocrisy. Why do you believe Juanita Broaddrick and not these two women,  Cooper asked, leaving a dumbfounded Lord to claim that the media isn t giving Clinton s accusers an  equal forum. But Clinton s accusers have no bearing on this election because Bill Clinton is not running for president, as other panelists reminded Lord. Furthermore, Bill Clinton was never charged with committing any crimes. Juanita Broaddrick filed a sworn affidavit stating that the rape allegations against Clinton are untrue. And these accusations against Clinton are 20 years old and have received a ton of media coverage over the years, especially during Clinton s presidency. The allegations against Trump, meanwhile, are new and haven t received near as much coverage.But Lord whined that the New York Times hasn t interviewed Broaddrick and then brought up a ridiculous anecdotal claim about meeting a couple from Virginia who supposedly think the media the treating Trump unfairly.When it became clear that Lord and Trump s other surrogates were not going to win this fight they resorted to calling Hillary Clinton an  enabler  of Bill Clinton behavior who supposedly bullied the women accusing Bill of sexual misconduct.But the other panelists would have none of it and proceeded to smack them down.Here s the video via YouTube:[ad3media campaign= 1136 ]The accusations against Bill Clinton have nothing to do with this election. Hillary Clinton is running for president, not her husband. Trump, on the other hand, IS running for president and the allegations against him are new and should be covered by the media.Donald Trump is unfit to be president and the fact that his supporters have to resort to bringing up Bill Clinton and his accusers in a lame effort to distract from that proves it.Featured Image: Screenshot",0

"MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, who withdrew from a presidential election re-run set for Oct. 26 saying it should only take place once wide-ranging reforms are undertaken, urged his supporters on Sunday to hold protests. Authorities have banned protests in central Nairobi and other hotspots in a bid to keep a lid on mounting political turmoil in the build-up to the repeat vote, in which Odinga had been set to challenge President Uhuru Kenyatta once again.  The Supreme Court nullified Kenyatta s victory in the original election on Aug. 8, citing procedural irregularities. On Friday, Odinga said his withdrawal meant the poll had been  canceled  and that there should be fresh nominations for a new vote.  Come out in large numbers tomorrow like you have done today and fear no-one. This is your country and you have the right to protest,  he told a crowd in the coastal city of Mombasa. The election board has said the vote will go ahead, with Kenyatta facing six other candidates, none of whom polled more than 1 percent in August.  During a trip to London last week, Odinga told Reuters that he might consider returning to the Supreme Court for clarification on whether the Oct. 26 poll was legal.   I went to tell our friends in London the truth of what was happening here. Jubilee should know that we are not interested in a coalition government,  he said, referring to Kenyatta s party. Despite the ban, protests have taken place in the East African country   a regional and trade gateway which is the region s richest economy and an important Western ally in the fight against militant Islamists. On Friday, Kenyan police shot dead two people and wounded a third when a crowd tried to storm a police station in the town of Bondo in the southwest county of Siaya during a rally. Police also used teargas to break up small demonstrations in Kenya s three main cities   Kisumu, the capital and the port of Mombasa   the same day, defying the ban on rallies in city centers. Hospital authorities said 20 people were injured in Kisumu, an opposition stronghold.   I am ready to die for change in Kenya,  James Orengo, an opposition senator and lawyer who led Odinga s successful petition at the Supreme Court, told the crowd in Mombasa, which numbered in the thousands.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump named 64 agriculture policy advisors on Tuesday, including the governors of Iowa and five other farm states and a former federal agriculture secretary. The announcement came as Trump, a New York businessman seeking his first elected office, looks to improve his standing among voters, particularly those in swing states such as Iowa, where some recent opinion polls show Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a tight race.  Republican Governors Terry Branstad of Iowa, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota, Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska were included on a list of advisors distributed by Trump’s campaign. Branstad spokesman Ben Hammes said in an interview that the governor will focus on increasing government support for renewable energy as part of the committee. Also on the list were John Block, U.S. agriculture secretary under Republican President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1986, and former Governors Rick Perry of Texas and Jim Gilmore of Virginia, who both unsuccessfully ran against Trump for the Republican nomination. “The members of my agricultural advisory committee represent the best that America can offer to help serve agricultural communities,” Trump said in a statement. Members of an executive board will “convene on a regular basis,” he said. Committee members have already talked via telephone to outline some of the issues they expect to tackle, committee member A.G. Kawamura said in an interview. They range from immigration and climate change to global trade and “how to define food and energy security for the U.S. in the years ahead,” said Kawamura, a former California agriculture secretary. Battles between the agriculture sector and its critics have grown fierce in recent years - from fights over water access in California and declining grain prices, to mounting pressure from consumer groups over how food is produced and labeled. Both presidential campaigns have largely ignored the sector, though, Kawamura said, adding that lack of discussion was one of the reasons he joined Trump’s committee. In June, representatives of about a dozen agricultural associations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union, met with staffers for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the first time to begin a discussion on farm policy. Clinton had a 6-percentage-point lead over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Tuesday. ",1
"Donald Trump won t tell you this on his Twitter feed.The last time the tourism industry in this country saw such a drop was in the decade after 9/11.And now, Trump is the reason why people don t want to come to America.Under President Obama, the tourism industry enjoyed a resurgence as the number of international visitors rose to 78 million in 2015, a 27 million increase from 2006.But that s imploding now as Trump s policies continue to scare the hell out of people around the globe.Trump s travel ban, his proposed border wall, his attacks on our allies, and his anti-immigrant nationalist policies have struck fear into international travelers who wish to come to the United States to tour the land of the free.According to Alternet,Frommer s, a prominent travel guide, notes that  the prestigious Travel Weekly magazine (as close to an  official  travel publication as they come) has set the decline in foreign tourism at 6.8 percent  for this year. ForwardKeys, which crunches travel numbers, points to a 6.5 percent downturn in international travel to the U.S. in the week after Trump attempted to issue the Muslim travel ban in January. During the same period, the company found reservations for U.S.-bound flights from Western Europe fell 14 percent and plunged 38 percent from across the Middle East. And a survey released this month by the Global Business Travel Association concluded  45 percent of European business travel professionals say they are less likely to schedule meetings or events in the U.S.,  according to the Los Angeles Times.Even white foreigners from Canada and Europe are choosing to stay away from the United States because of Donald Trump.And the impact will do a lot of damage to our economy, including a loss of jobs and a decrease in our gross domestic product.The loss of all those visitors could mean future problems for a sector on which more than 15 million people rely for employment. Oxford Economics suggests the toll may ultimately ripple beyond the travel industry, even reducing the U.S. gross domestic product by a few percentage points, per Market Watch.This will particularly affect cities and states on the coasts where popular destinations such as Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City are located. As stated above, the ripple effects could reach beyond the travel industry as the lack of tourism dollars will hurt the hotel industry, restaurants, airlines, retail stores, and any other industry that profits from tourism.So this is a big deal that will hurt our country as long as Trump remains in office.America s thriving $250 billion tourism industry is about to take a serious $7.4 billion hit because of Trump s policies. It s a huge setback on our economy and it s only going to get worse as Trump continues to attack Mexico and China.So just remember that while Trump continues to tout plans by automakers and other companies that were made way before he took office, the tourism bubble is about pop on his watch and his policies are directly to blame.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0

"ISTANBUL/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Turkey s parliament voted on Saturday to extend by a year a mandate authorizing the deployment of Turkish troops in Iraq and Syria, stepping up pressure against an independence referendum in northern Iraq s Kurdish region in two days  time. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Turkey would take security, economic and political steps in response to the referendum, which President Tayyip Erdogan s spokesman described as a  terrible mistake  that would trigger new regional crises. The United States and other Western powers have, like Turkey, urged authorities in the semi-autonomous Iraqi region to cancel Monday s vote. They say the move by the oil-producing area distracts from the fight against Islamic State. In Iraq, a Kurdistan regional government delegation arrived in Baghdad for talks with the Iraqi government in an effort to defuse tensions, but a senior Kurdish official said the vote was going ahead.  The delegation will discuss the referendum but the referendum is still happening,  Hoshiyar Zebari, a top adviser to Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani, told Reuters. Turkey, which has NATO s second-largest army, said on Friday that the Iraqi vote would threaten its security and force it to slap sanctions on a neighbor and trading partner, although it did not specify what measures it might take. Asked on Saturday if a cross-border operation was among the options, Yildirim told reporters:  Naturally, it is a question of timing as to when security, economic and security options are implemented. Developing conditions will determine that.  The mandate approved by Turkey s parliament on Saturday was first passed in 2014 with the aim of tackling threats from within its southern neighbors Iraq and Syria. It had been due to expire in October.  Turkey is home to the largest Kurdish population in the region and is itself fighting a Kurdish insurgency on its soil. But it is also the main conduit for oil exports from Iraq s Kurdish region and it has said that any break-up of neighboring Iraq or Syria could lead to a global conflict. In a speech to parliament, Turkish Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli voiced concern about the referendum s impact on the region s ethnic and sectarian relationships, saying it could trigger an  uncontrollable fire .  Pulling out just a brick from a structure based on very sensitive and fragile balances will sow the seeds for new hatred, enmity and clashes,  he said. A particular area of concern is the multi-ethnic oil city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the recognized boundaries of the autonomous Kurdish region and is claimed by Baghdad. It is dominated by Kurds but is also home to Arabs, Assyrian Christians and Turkmen   of whom Turkey has long seen itself as the protector.  If the referendum is not canceled, there will be serious consequences. Erbil must immediately refrain from this terrible mistake, which will trigger new crises in the region,  Erdogan s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted on Saturday. Militants from the Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) launched a rocket and mortar attack from the Iraqi side of the border on Turkey s Semdinli district on Saturday, killing one Turkish soldier and a worker in the area of a military base, the Hakkari governor s office said in a statement. The PKK launched its separatist insurgency in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. It is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The Iraqi army s chief of staff, Lieutenant General Othman al-Ghanmi, met his Turkish counterpart, General Hulusi Akar, in Turkey and they discussed the  illegitimate  referendum, Turkey s military said.  The importance of maintaining Iraq s territorial integrity and political unity was stressed once again,  it said. The Turkish army launched military exercises on Monday near the Habur border crossing to Iraq. Military sources said they were due to last until Sept. 26, the day after the planned vote.  On Saturday the military said additional units had joined the exercises as they entered their second stage. Turkey has for years been northern Iraq s main link to the outside world. It has built strong trade ties with the semi-autonomous region, which exports hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil per day through Turkey to international markets.  ",1
"(Reuters) - Over 7.4 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama because of Hurricane Irma, according to state officials and utilities on Monday.  Most outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state. A unit of NextEra Energy Inc and the state s biggest power company, FPL said its outages dipped to around 3.4 million by Monday evening from a peak of 3.6 million earlier in the day. As the storm weakens as it heads toward Georgia, outages have leveled off or even declined at other Florida utilities, while increasing in Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama. Florida outages for Duke Energy Corp, which serves the northern and central parts of the state, increased to almost 1.2 million, according to the company s website. Irma hit southwest Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second-highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It gradually weakened to a tropical storm by Monday morning.  The storm, which was moving into southern Georgia, was packing maximum sustained winds of 60 miles (97 km) per hour, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center s latest update at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). In Georgia, utilities reported about 950,000 customers without power. Other big power utilities in Florida are units of Emera Inc and Southern Co, which also operates the biggest electric companies in Georgia and Alabama. ",1
"The fundamental transformation of America: Watch Obama and the Democrat party beg tens of millions of people who broke the law when they entered our country to get to the polls to shape the future of our nation Leticia de la Paz s family has two major motivations for pursuing U.S. citizenship.They want to move past the discrimination they feel as foreign-born residents, and they want to take part in choosing a leader who, as de la Paz says,  will care about immigrants and a better future. She shares these sentiments through a Spanish-language interpreter, as her 25-year-old daughter, Gabriela, works through a crowded room at Nashville s Global Mall where dozens of Middle Tennessee immigrants are completing the paperwork that will put them on the path to naturalization. We are here in the United States to have a better life and to have better rights,  says Leticia de la Paz, whose husband came to the United States in 1989 and became a citizen last year, inspiring their daughter.For many, this is the next step.Tennessee has one of the fastest-growing immigrant populations in the country, according to Stephanie Teatro, co-executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition. Already, more than 114,000, or nearly 38 percent of the total foreign-born population, are naturalized citizens and eligible to vote, she says. Statewide another approximately 75,000 immigrants are eligible to apply for citizenship today but haven t taken action.For Cristina Corona, a 30-year-old from Guadalajara, Mexico, the clinic carried concrete value.Two years ago, Corona began the citizenship process, hiring a local lawyer to walk her through the process. She spent $10,000, she said, and then the firm shut down and all her information was lost.On Saturday, she started again.Like the de la Paz family, Corona said she faces discrimination, particularly in airports where she often gets detained. She hopes having a U.S. passport will ease that. She also hopes it will help her find more job opportunities beyond working as a server in her mother s cafe on Nolensville Pike.And there is one more motivating factor: Her mother s insistence that Corona vote.  She says all the time,  Get out to the polls.   As the number of immigrant families continues to grow, so does their political power.Immigrant voters played a vital role in the recent Nashville mayoral election, as the immigrant coalition registered hundreds of new American voters, and immigrant community members reportedly turned out to the polls in large numbers, though official voter turnout demographics are not yet available.Nashville mayoral candidates took notice of the growing immigrant vote, as every candidate attended the local Immigrant and Refugee mayoral forum. Candidates translated campaign materials into Spanish, they visited mosques and did interviews on Spanish-language radio.Via: The Tennessean",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A raid on the Virginia home of President Donald Trump’s former 2016 election campaign manager showed an investigation of possible ties between the campaign and Russia is intensifying and focused on the financial dealings of Trump associates, sources familiar with the probe said.  Longtime political consultant and lobbyist Paul Manafort is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, said two people familiar with the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Manafort’s spokesman Jason Maloni confirmed on Wednesday that the FBI executed a search warrant at one of Manafort’s homes.  “Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well,” Maloni said in an email. Manafort’s house in Alexandria, near Washington, was raided in the early morning of July 26, the Washington Post reported. The previous day Manafort had met with Senate Intelligence Committee staff, the Washington Post reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the probe. Tax documents and financial records were sought by agents for Mueller in the raid, the New York Times reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Mueller’s team is poring over Manafort’s financial and real estate records in New York and his involvement in Ukrainian politics, the two sources told Reuters last month.   Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal called the raid a “highly significant step” and said it was “typical of the most serious criminal investigations dealing with uncooperative or untrusted potential targets.” The FBI did not immediately return a request for comment. Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for Mueller’s office, declined to confirm the raid. Trump has been attacking Blumenthal on Twitter this week after the senator urged Mueller to press his inquiry forward. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the presidential race, in part by hacking and releasing emails embarrassing to Trump’s opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, to help him get elected in November. Trump has called Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt.” Allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Moscow have hounded the Republican president since he took office in January, presenting a major distraction from his policy agenda. Russia has repeatedly denied meddling in the U.S. election. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office has been trying to track money that Manafort used to buy properties in New York, and looking into millions of dollars of loans later taken out on the properties, according to a person familiar with the matter. The prosecutor issued a subpoena to Federal Savings Bank, a small Chicago bank founded by a former Trump campaign adviser,  and is interested in the loan paperwork, the person said. It is unclear when the subpoena went out, but the first subpoenas in the probe went out months ago, the person said. Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., declined to comment. Steve Calk, the bank’s chairman and CEO, who was named to Trump’s economic advisory council during the campaign, declined to comment through a spokeswoman for the bank.  “Mr. Manafort’s real estate loans are all arm’s length transactions at or above market rates,” said Maloni. “There is nothing unusual about buying real estate through an LLC.” The New York Attorney General’s office also is looking into Manafort’s real estate transactions, another person said. One question for investigators was whether Manafort had knowledge of any Trump campaign dealings with Russia, including meetings with Russians with government ties, said one source familiar with Mueller’s work. The same question was relevant to investigators in regard to Trump’s fired former national security adviser, retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the source said. “Financial matters have paper trails that can be easy to pick up and follow, so that’s a logical place to start,” the source added. Congressional committees are looking at a June 2016 meeting in New York with a Russian lawyer organized by Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Trump Jr. released emails last month that showed he welcomed the prospect of receiving damaging information about Clinton. Manafort attended the meeting. Legal experts noted that the FBI had enough evidence to get approval for a search warrant concerning Manafort.  “Somewhere, there now exists under seal what is likely a very detailed affidavit laying out criminal allegations involving Paul Manafort, and specifically, there is probable cause to believe he has committed a crime or there is evidence of a crime at his home,” said Alex Little, a former federal prosecutor now with the law firm Bone McAllester Norton. A Senate Judiciary Committee aide said the panel has received more than 20,000 pages of documents from Trump’s presidential campaign, Manafort and Trump Jr. ",1
"PARIS (Reuters) - French president Emmanuel Macron s popularity jumped back above 50 percent thanks in part to better ratings among the young and the working class, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday, confirming a rebound that started at the beginning of December. Macron s popularity dropped quickly after he swept to an electoral victory in May on a centrist platform, shattering a long-standing two-party system in France.  But while the former investment banker has struggled to shake off a  president of the rich  tag pinned on him by rivals for policies such as cuts in housing benefits, Macron s efforts to defend French interests abroad have helped lift his ratings.  His popularity rose above 50 percent for the first time since his election in early December, and a new poll on Wednesday, taken on Monday and Tuesday, showed the president scoring a 52 percent approval rating. That was a six-percentage-point jump from November, according to the BVA poll, carried out for Orange and La Tribune and released on the eve of Macron s 40th birthday.  As well as praising Macron s international efforts, those surveyed also highlighted that he was delivering on campaign promises, BVA said, even though some policies like a labor reform that gives employers greater freedom to hire and fire staff were deeply unpopular with many of his detractors.  The president is most popular with older voters and higher earners, but made the biggest progress in the latest poll with the young, BVA added.  Other surveys this week also confirmed Macron was making headway, although a ViaVoice poll for Liberation published on Tuesday put his popularity rating lower, at 46 percent. That was also a six-percentage-point improvement on the previous month.  An Odoxa survey gave Macron a 54 percent approval rating.  Macron s turnaround in polls comes as political rivals are scrambling to regroup and form a stronger opposition, at a time when both the left and right are deeply fragmented. The president s office recently played down attacks from some opponents over Macron s planned birthday celebrations with his family in the grounds of a former royal palace, which drew jibes about him being out of touch.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to name John Rood, a senior executive at defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp and a 20-year veteran of various government roles, as undersecretary of defense for policy, the Pentagon’s No. 3 job, the White House said on Wednesday. Rood, an Arizona native, previously worked for arms maker Raytheon Inc and was a State Department and National Security Council official in the administration of former President George W. Bush. His appointment to the position, which has been vacant since the start of the Trump administration, is subject to Senate confirmation. Rood served at the Defense Department as deputy assistant secretary of defense for forces policy and spent 11 years as an analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency following missile programs in foreign countries. Rood was also a senior policy adviser to former Republican U.S. Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona. At Lockheed, he was senior vice president for Lockheed Martin International, where his responsibilities included managing marketing and government relationships. Army Secretary Mark Esper is a former lobbyist at Raytheon, as well as a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel.  ",1

"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary is facing a frontal assault from U.S. financier George Soros who is attacking the country via his non-government organizations and European Union bureaucrats, a top ruling party politician said on Monday. Fidesz Vice Chairman Gergely Gulyas said Soros  claims that the Hungarian government lied in its campaign against him were  not substantial , adding the billionaire and the European Union pushed the same pro-migrant agenda. He rejected charges by Soros that the government s campaign stoked anti-Muslim sentiment and employed anti-Semitic tropes. ",1
"Jason Kander is a Democrat running for a United States Senate seat in Missouri. The seat is currently held by Roy Blunt, a Republican. Kander, who is 35-years-old and is also Missouri s current attorney general, recently released probably the best political advertisement we will see in the 2016 election.Kander s opponent has been attacking him for supporting more effective background checks on gun sales.That was a major mistake for Blunt. That s because Kander is an Afghanistan war veteran. Which means that he knows his way around firearms, which Kander demonstrates perfectly in his campaign video. The thirty-second advertisement busts a myth that the right-wing has made about gun-law-reformers for decades   that enacting smart safety regulations is tantamount to unilateral gun confiscation.In reality, despite what the NRA would have people think, gun law reformers want to create laws that should be considered common sense. Such as say, not letting people on terrorist watch lists purchase firearms.In the ad, Kander stands in front of a table with a dissembled rifle on the table. Kander proceeds to assemble the weapon while blindfolded. While Kander assembles the rifle he says: I m Jason Kander and Senator Blunt has been attacking me on guns. Well, in the army I learned how to use and respect my rifle. In Afghanistan, I volunteered to be a gun in an unarmored convoy of SUV s. In the state legislature, I supported 2nd amendment rights. I also believe in background checks so that terrorists can t get their hands on one of these. When Kander finishes assembling the rifle, he removes his blindfold and says,  I approve this message because I d like to see Senator Blunt do this. A majority of Americans are in favor of expanding background checks. Yet, Congress has not taken action to support legislation that would create such a system. That s because the NRA is holding our Congress hostage. They donate huge amounts of moneyto political candidates. In 2016, so far the NRA has spent $825,000 dollars in campaign contributions. A paltry sum compared to the total amounts of money they have spent influencing politics. Overall, they have spent more than a quarter million dollars supporting Blunt.They also work endlessly to brainwash their supporters into thinking that all gun-reformers want to get rid of the second amendment. Which is absolutely not true. This ad effectively smashes that conflation in mere seconds.You can watch the ad below in full:https://www.facebook.com/kanderformissouri/videos/1102167116543853/Feature image from video screenshot",0

"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The former finance minister under Brazil s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday accused the ex-president of receiving bribes from contractor Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], adding to a list of corruption accusations that threaten Lula s ability to run for president in 2018. Lawyers for the former finance minister, Antonio Palocci, said he told prosecutors that Lula accepted Odebrecht s purchase of land for an institute in his name, a country house in Sao Paulo state and 300 million reais ($97 million) to be used after he left office. A representative for Lula said in a statement that Palocci, who was arrested a year ago in a corruption investigation, was lying and making accusations without evidence to secure a favorable deal with prosecutors to reduce his sentence. Such testimony from a close confidant could be damning for Lula, who intends to run for president again next year if he can successfully appeal a conviction that would bar him from standing. Lula faces four additional trials. Separately on Wednesday, Brazil s top prosecutor, Rodrigo Janot, charged Lula, ex-President Dilma Rousseff and a former minister with obstruction of justice related to Lula s nomination as Rousseff s chief of staff in 2016. The nomination, later struck down by the Supreme Court, would have shielded Lula from prosecution by lower courts. It was the second charge from Janot in two days. On Tuesday he accused Lula, Rousseff and six other members of their Workers Party for allegedly forming a criminal organization to carry out corruption and other crimes involving state-controlled oil company Petrobras. Lula and Rousseff deny the charges. Palocci leveled his accusations in two hours of testimony on Wednesday as part of a probe into allegations that Lula accepted the land for the institute.   It was a blood pact and a package of bribes that included payment for a property, an estate ranch and 300 million reais that gradually were made available according to a spreadsheet delivered by the contractor,  said Adriano Bretas, one of Palocci s lawyers. Tracy Reinaldet, another of Palocci s lawyers, said the agreement was made during the transition from Lula into Rousseff s first term. Palocci also served as Rousseff s chief of staff initially but was forced to resign due to corruption allegations. ",1

"The only people who think all Jewish people are rich and shrewd with money are anti-Semitic racists, so therefore it should come as no surprise that this is yet another group of bigots that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump would try to appeal to in his attacks on Hillary Clinton. No, Hillary Clinton is not Jewish, but that didn t stop The Donald. You see, he is jealous because when it comes to fundraising, Hillary Clinton is winning. While she has raised roughly $68.5 million in funds during June, while Trump s campaign is broke.Instead of raising money or staying quiet on the issue, Trump, in his own unique brand of childish, racist buffoonery, Trump tweeted out a  Crooked Hillary  image that included a Star of David and a pile of money.

"Attacking women s health is not a  moderate  position.So, it s pretty easy to call bullshit on Ohio Governor John Kasich s insistence that he is the only moderate Republican left in the GOP field.On Sunday, Kasich signed a bill stripping Planned Parenthood of millions of dollars for performing what Republicans call  nontherapeutic  abortions which are defined as any abortion that isn t in the case of rape, incest, or saving the life of the mother.In other words, Kasich and his conservative supporters in the state legislature are telling Planned Parenthood that if they want to continue being funded, they must deny women their constitutional right to obtain an abortion unless they meet one of the three criteria listed above.The problem with this conservative logic is that only 3 percent of services Planned Parenthood provides are abortion-related. Plus, state and federal funding is not used by Planned Parenthood to pay for abortion.What state and federal funds are used for, however, are crucial medical services that women will no longer have access to because Republicans don t care about collateral damage in their war on a woman s right to choose.According to Huffington Post, Planned Parenthood is about to lose $1.3 million that would have been spent on  HIV testing, cancer screenings and programs that help prevent domestic violence and infant mortality. This isn t even the first time Kasich has attacked women s health since becoming governor.He has also signed bills banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, banning public hospitals from accepting transfer patients from clinics, and stripping rape crisis centers from funding if they refer patients to an abortion provider.As for the current bill Kasich signed, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards denounced it and the man who signed it. John Kasich is proudly eliminating care for expectant mothers and newborns; he is leaving thousands without vital STD and HIV testing, slashing a program to fight domestic violence, and cutting access to essential, basic health care. It s clear Kasich has no regard for women s health or lives, and will stop at nothing to block health care for the tens of thousands of Ohioans who rely on Planned Parenthood. And Kasich signed this bill, now one of the most extreme anti-women laws in the nation, as he parades across the country trying to convince everyone, especially women, that he is a  moderate  Republican deserving of their support in his bid to become President of the United States, a position he would absolutely use to ban abortion entirely and eliminate Planned Parenthood.Kasich is not a moderate. He s just another conservative extremist like Ted Cruz.Featured image from Flickr",0
"ABC host George Stephanopoulos sat down with Kellyanne Conway for an interview this morning on  This Week . Stephanopoulos started out the interview by mentioning the new jobs report and the explosion of the stock market under President Trump. He barely took a breath before he jumped directly to a poll that showed despite all of his many accomplishments, that Trump isn t very popular. Kellyanne Conway was quick to point out, that although Trump s poll numbers aren t as strong as she d like them to be, he s keeping his head down and focusing on his agenda. In other words, President Trump is laser focused on honoring the campaign promises he made to American people who elected him. What a novel idea One can only imagine the disappointment Stephanopoulos must have felt when he got the dreaded answer from Conway to his question about President Trump s plans to run in 2020. After all, who could forget when George Stephanopoulos  wife promised (but of course, didn t follow through) that she would move her family to another country if President Trump won the election?Watch:Conway responded to Stephanopoulos  question about Trump running in 2020:  The president says privately and publicly, often, George that he ll be president for seven and a half more years, so he plans on being a two-term president. Last week, the New York Times article attempted to convince their readers that the Republican Party is divided and fractured and that many of the members of the party were attempting to convince Vice President Mike Pence to run for president in 2020.Pence was furious at the accusation that he was somehow involved in a potential coup against President Trump. So much for the wishful thinking of not very credible and very biased New York Times.And finally, it wouldn t be an interview with the mainstream media if they didn t ask about Trump s phony Russia connection. Kellyanne Conway didn t disappoint with her answer as she blasted Stephanopoulos for pushing the fake narrative:  People just can t get over that election, George. It s corrosive to our body politic ",0
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - With a budget deal elusive and a midnight Friday deadline fast approaching, Illinois faces a crisis that threatens everything from its education system to government payrolls and the likelihood of becoming the first U.S. state ever with a junk credit rating. Illinois, which has gone a record-setting two straight years without a complete spending plan due to an impasse between its Republican governor and Democratic legislature, is poised to start fiscal 2018 on Saturday budget-less again. The consequences would be dire for the nation’s fifth-largest state, which has a $15 billion backlog of unpaid bills. S&P has warned that starting a new fiscal year without a budget that reduces a chronic structural deficit could trigger a downgrade to BB-plus. That would put Illinois on the same financial footing as Azerbaijan, Bulgaria and Portugal. “The lack of a budget makes all the difference here,” said S&P analyst Gabriel Petek, who voiced concerns about the state’s ability to control its finances and cash flow. Even the agency that oversees elections is not immune. A top Illinois State Board of Elections official told Reuters the agency faces the loss of certain cyber security protections beginning in September because of an unpaid $9,000 bill. The board is among 21 state election authorities the U.S. Homeland Security Department confirmed were targeted by Russian hackers during the 2016 election. An immediate casualty is the state lottery. For the first time, Illinois suspended sales of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets and announced a delay in payments after Saturday on any prizes exceeding $25,000. The lack of a state budget threatens serious disruption to schools during the next six weeks. Out of Illinois’ 401 public school systems, 144 expect to have less than 90 days of operating cash at fiscal year-end, said Robert Wolfe, chief financial officer for the Illinois State Board of Education. “If there is no budget, it is doubtful we can open our doors on August 15th,” said Ralph Grimm, school superintendent in Galesburg, Illinois. Public universities, which have suffered a steep drop in state funding, now fear further erosion in student enrollment, the loss of accreditation, and bruising spending cuts. Lindsay Perez, a suburban Chicago mother, and her 9-year-old daughter Elena, who survives on a Medicaid-funded ventilator, described for reporters on Thursday the horrific situation of losing some of her medical supplies because of the budget crisis. The girl, who was born without a lung, urged politicians to pass a budget. “If you could try hard enough, you could do it,” she said. Meanwhile, Illinois risks intervention from federal judges overseeing consent decrees requiring the state to fund medical and other services for the disadvantaged. A U.S. judge is weighing how much more Illinois must allocate to pay down $3.1 billion in Medicaid bills to ensure continued medical care for 3 million poor and disabled residents. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, whose office pays the state’s bills, has pledged to fully cover debt service on bonds, but essential payments for pensions and payroll could face reductions if the judge orders a higher priority for Medicaid. Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan offered reporters a murky response on Thursday when asked if a resolution to the fiscal mess could be struck with Governor Bruce Rauner by the midnight Friday deadline. “Oh sure, if everybody is reasonable,” Madigan said of a potential breakthrough. “It could’ve been done two years ago.” The long odds that Madigan and Rauner, who posted a Twitter photo of himself at his desk waiting for a “balanced budget,” could strike a deal appeared to worsen with Thursday’s abrupt resignation of Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno, respected by both parties as an expert negotiator. “I really tried hard. It’s time for someone else to take the reins,” she told reporters. ",1
"Former White House Press Secretary in the Obama administration Jay Carney is sure he knows who the president wants for his successor: Hillary Clinton. President Obama has yet to hand out any official endorsements during this primary season, but, of course, like all major political players, he has his favorite. Carney is sure that person is Hillary. He said to Brooke Baldwin on CNN: I don t think there is any doubt that he wants Hillary to win the nomination and believes that she would be the best candidate in the fall and the most effective as president in carrying forward what he s achieved. I think the President has signaled, while still remaining neutral, that he supports Secretary Clinton s candidacy and would prefer to see her as the nominee. He won t officially embrace her unless and until it s clear that she s going to be the nominee. I think he is maintaining that tradition of not intervening in a party primary. Smartly, the president is refusing to comment on what Jay Carney has said. However, he s done all but given an official nod to Hillary as the primary race heats up. President Obama will likely give the nod to whomever gets the nomination, as we all want a Democrat in the White House. However, he wants Hillary to be that person. That much is pretty clear.It s hard for anybody to speak for President Obama, of course, but his former Secretary of State seems to be his pick. Hopefully, we find out for sure in short order, but it s pretty smart for a sitting president not to endorse one of his party s candidates over the other while waiting to see who actually gets the nomination, especially in a close, neck-in-neck race. He must be pretty antsy, though, being unable to endorse right away.No worries, Mr. President. The primaries will be over soon, and you can speak your piece then.Featured image via screen capture from Flickr",0
"On his 100th day in office, a listless Donald Trump sat down with Reuters to talk about his accomplishments. As fate would have it, Trump had just been told that two servicemembers had been killed in an anti-ISIS raid in Afghanistan, his re-re-remade healthcare bill was dead on arrival, and his plans to build a wall were going up in flames. But he had other things on his mind. For Donald Trump, every day is November 8th, 2016.To the three reporters, Trump passed out a printed picture of the United States, with counties he won in the election colored in red.More than five months after his victory and two days shy of the 100-day mark of his presidency, the election is still on Trump s mind. Midway through a discussion about Chinese President Xi Jinping, the president paused to hand out copies of what he said were the latest figures from the 2016 electoral map. Here, you can take that, that s the final map of the numbers,  the Republican president said from his desk in the Oval Office, handing out maps of the United States with areas he won marked in red.  It s pretty good, right? The red is obviously us. Later he posed for photos, insisting on holding up the map. (Note: Trump s White House photographer, who formerly worked in the Bush White House, likes to take pictures of Trump from really far away. It s unclear exactly why.)So this happened today  pic.twitter.com/UqtgvoyIRj  SalenaZito (@SalenaZito) April 28, 2017here's a pic from reuters of Trump with the electoral maps he showed to reporters yesterday pic.twitter.com/1X3edpeJDQ  Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) April 28, 2017Reporter Jeff Mason recounted the surreal moment the President of the United States interrupted questions on North Korea and China to brag about a map of the election he had won more than 5 months earlier. His expressions cycle from disbelief to pity to humor and back to disbelief.CNN s Chris Cuomo asked the reporters the obvious question: Is Trump really so insecure that he still feels he has to prove that he won the election? Mason said it could be a lot of factors (all troubling from a mental health standpoint): I think that s a good question and it s hard for me to answer that. I think he just wanted to relish in the fact that this map, uh, looks good for him and he said  the red is obviously us  and the red are areas in the country that he won. So he s just very proud of it. And whether that s rooted in a sense that he still has to prove that he won or that he s upset that the media got it wrong in terms of the predictions ahead of time it s hard for me to say. Trump, a 70-year-old billionaire, craves the attention one might give a child for a project they made in art class. He may as well have asked the reporters to pin the map up on their refrigerator doors.Making it even more clear that Trump is suddenly feeling very small, he later admitted that being president is really hard, and it s not as fun as his old life. The fact that running the country wouldn t be as easy as being a semi-retired billionaire and reality tv show host was something that apparently never occurred to Trump prior to being elected. I loved my previous life. I had so many things going. This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier. At least he s got his map.Featured image via CNN",0

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives is unlikely to raise the country’s debt ceiling without conditions to rein in spending, a Republican lawmaker said on Tuesday, raising the specter of another potential clash even as Republicans control both Congress and the White House. The Trump administration has asked Congress to extend the federal borrowing capacity to meet U.S. payment obligations with a “clean” bill that does not include any other provisions.  Asked if the House would act to pass such a bill when lawmakers return to Washington next month, U.S. Representative Tom Cole said “probably not clean.” “Most Republicans want to do something to lower the trajectory of the debt,” Cole, a member of the House  Appropriations and Budget committees, told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program.  Disagreements over the country’s borrowing capacity have prompted skirmishes for years. The latest tussle among Republicans follows a fight over healthcare legislation that left the party unable to make good on years of promises to  repeal and replace Obamacare, and has also raised concern among some investors.. The Treasury is expected to fully exhaust its remaining borrowing capacity in October. More fiscally conservative House Republicans see the debt ceiling issue as tied to deficit-reduction, and want to include spending cuts or the selling off of government assets — something Cole, a more establishment Republican, backed on Tuesday. Representative Mark Walker, who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee, said in a Washington Examiner Op-Ed article that a debt ceiling agreement should also address any future crises and recommended two conservative measures to that end. Both measures would require the government to issue new bonds to pay principal and interest on debt held by the public and by two Social Security trusts. One would also allow the president to rescind budget authority over unobligated funds and to order the sale of government assets.  “Both these measures are steps in the right direction,” wrote Walker, whose group represents the House’s largest conservative caucus. Both the House and the Senate left for summer recess until early September despite requests from the White House to pass a debt limit bill before the congressional break this month.   Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said debate over the issue could stretch into September, when lawmakers must also pass separate legislation to fund day-to-day government activities before the fiscal year ends later that month.

"By now you have all heard that Republican candidate Ted Cruz is absolutely loathed by the people he attended college with   including his former roommate. Craig Mazin, a screenwriter who worked on films like Scary Movie 2 & 3, has an entire Twitter page dedicated to how much he hates Ted; it literally it goes back years. On Saturday night, Cruz s former roommate stepped up his trolling game and leveled attacks against all of the GOP candidates.Here s a sample of his trolling:Ted is listening to Carson and thinking,  What is this road? It is not a low road. It is a  high road? DO NOT UNDERSTAND.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016 Uhhh, someone played the same tape in Rubio s head.

Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016Ted responds to  Maybe you have no heart  with a heartless, calculated chuckle.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016 This is amazing. Trump is attacking the crowd. It s almost admirable.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016Mazin is my new hero. He was absolutely hilarious, and he was spot-on so many times. The New Hampshire debate was filled with so much bullsh*t it was hard to wade through it all. I literally screamed at my television several times, and at least twice it was Cruz who turned me into a demon. In one statement, the Iowa Caucus winner told the crowd that he did not believe that waterboarding fit the definition of torture. Seriously, he doesn t believe that putting a mask on someone and pouring water on their face to simulate drowning is torture. He doesn t believe that making someone think they are going to die over and over and over again is wrong. I guess that means he d be totally cool with a foreign government doing it to our citizens then? The second thing he said that really pissed me off was when he brought up his sister dying of a drug overdose. Wait, no. I m sorry his  half-sister  who died of a drug overdose. You see, he began his monologue about her horrible death by referring to her as his  sister,  but then he quickly corrected himself and made sure everyone knew that they had different mothers. So, he was exploiting her death, but also trying to distance himself from it. Pretty f*cking despicable. The rest of the candidates had the same kind of night. Unlike the other yellfests you could almost feel the desperation of candidates like Ben Carson and Jeb Bush who failed so miserably in Iowa. No matter how bad it was, though, Craig Mazin definitely provided us with some much-needed comedic relief. I hope he shows up for the next debate. Featured image via Twitter/Flickr",0
"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe moved Patrick Chinamasa from the finance ministry on Monday to lead a new cyber security ministry that will focus on crimes on social media and other websites ahead of an election due next year. Chinamasa will be replaced at the treasury by Home Affairs Minister Ignatius Chombo in a cabinet reshuffle that also diminished the role of Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, seen as a potential successor to Mugabe. Chombo s move, announced in a government statement, comes against the backdrop of a severe hard currency shortage that has dealt a fresh blow to confidence and investment in the southern African economy, which uses the U.S dollar. Chinamasa was appointed finance minister after Mugabe s re-election in 2013 and his move to head the new Ministry of Cyber Security, Threat Detection and Mitigation was unexpected. Its creation comes after Chinamasa said last month the government would now treat social media as a security threat after accusing users of spreading rumors about shortages of basic goods, which caused panic buying and price increases. The government has been uneasy with social media after activists such as pastor Evan Mawararire and his #ThisFlag movement last year used social media to organize a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade. Government critics took to Twitter deriding Chinamasa as new  minister of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp affairs . Chinamasa, a lawyer by training, will also be responsible for bringing to parliament a long awaited cyber crimes bill that criminalize false information posted on the internet, revenge porn, cyber-bullying and online activity against the government. Meanwhile Chombo, who does not have a finance background and is a staunch Mugabe supporter who comes from the 93-year-old leader s rural home district, was the surprise pick for minister of finance. He will have to contend with a serious shortage of foreign currency that has seen U.S. dollar bank balances lose value against cash dollars, fanning a thriving black market. The worthless Zimbabwe dollar was replaced by the U.S. dollar in 2009 but the economy has struggled over the past 18 months because of a massive domestic shortage of greenbacks. As a result, cash, especially crisp, new, $100 bills, has enjoyed a steady 10 percent to 20 percent premium over dollars stored electronically in bank accounts - nicknamed  zollars  - meaning people have to transfer more than face value to the person selling the dollars on the black market. When Mugabe said on Saturday he was going to review the performance of his ministers, speculation was rife that Mnangagwa, who said last week he had been poisoned in August, would be among the casualties. Mnangagwa has come under attack from a ruling party faction that accuses him of seeking to force Mugabe to resign in his favor. The ZANU-PF is divided into two camps, one supporting Mnangagwa to succeed him and another rallying behind First Lady Grace Mugabe. Mnangagwa, who denies the accusations, lost oversight of the Justice Ministry to the head of Zimbabwe s spy agency Happyton Bonyongwe. Bonyongwe, a retired army general who headed the national intelligence agency for 15 years, will be responsible for new legislation and will supervise the election due next year, including determining which foreign observers to invite. Mugabe, who has ruled the former British colony since independence in 1980, has said he plans to run for another 5-year term next year, his last under the constitution, when he will be 94. In total, 10 cabinet ministers changed posts while two were dropped entirely. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate’s No. 2 Republican said on Monday that he hoped a vote could be held next week on a bill to roll back Obamacare and that a revised Republican healthcare plan could be released later this week, The Hill reported. “We’re just trying to get a good picture of what the alternatives are, and hopefully next week we’ll be prepared to take the bill up and vote on it,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told reporters, according to the publication. Cornyn said Republicans were still waiting to hear back from the Congressional Budget Office on some proposed changes to their initial draft bill, The Hill said. ",1

"It s hard to imagine a President who could be more anti-American and more pro-terror than Barack Hussein Obama. And then my mind drifts to Hillary and Benghazi The Obama administration is emptying the military s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of avowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but several American service members languish in another military prison for actions on those same battlefields that their supporters say merit clemency, if not gratitude.Among the prison population at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, are remaining members of the so-called  Leavenworth 10,  convicted service members doing terms ranging from 10 to 40 years for heat-of-the-battle decisions their supporters say saved American lives.[quote_box_center] The very people who protect our freedoms and liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties taken away,  said retired U.S. Army Col. Allen West, a former congressman and political commentator.  I think it s appalling and no one is talking about this issue. [/quote_box_center]The  Leavenworth 10  is the name given to a fluctuating number of men housed at Leavenworth for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that their supporters say were justified. Over the years, a handful have been paroled, and more have been incarcerated.Among the more well-known cases is that of Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012 in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after the prior leader and several others were killed days before. The Taliban suspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who flew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.A Facebook page devoted to Lorance s case has drawn more than 12,000 likes, and supporters have launched a website, FreeClintLorance.com, dedicated to winning his release. A WhiteHouse.gov petition calling for Lorance to be pardoned garnered nearly 125,000 signatures, but the White House has not taken action.Critics say Lorance was given a military trial, and his conviction was based in large part on the testimony of men serving under him.It was September of 2010 when Sgt. Derrick Miller of Maryland, on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan, was warned the unit s base had been penetrated. An Afghan suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation and wound up dead. Miller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun and that he shot him in self-defense. But he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.U.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley   a highly decorated, 20-year vet who served in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq War   also is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems from an April, 2007, incident in Iraq in which he and his unit captured enemies following a firefight. He radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify officials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go, according to his legal team.Two years later, a sergeant who had served with Hatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer and falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told investigators that Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a remote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He claimed their bodies were dumped in a canal, though none was ever found.Hatley, now 47, insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but believes he was punished in the interest of the government s relations with Baghdad. When concerns over appeasing a foreign country are allowed to interfere with justice for the purpose of the U.S. government or the military demonstrating that we, the military or the U.S. government will hold our soldiers accountable using a fatally flawed military judicial system, it doesn t matter what the truth is; it matters only that there is only the appearance of the truth,  he wrote in a message to supporters posted on freeJohnHatley.com.Law experts say military service members face a daunting task once accused of committing crimes in the heat of war. Killing on the battlefield is not the same as [a police officer] killing someone on the streets,  Dan Conway, an attorney who specializes in military law, told FoxNews.com.  When a cop uses force, there s a line of duty investigation. When a soldier uses force, it is investigated as criminal, and non-infantry investigators handle the case, many who have no combat experience. If you had experts handling the investigation, you d have much more balance,  he added.While the military rightly holds its soldiers to a high standard of justice, detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay have been freed even with no mitigating circumstances or reasonable belief of rehabilitation. The release of Gitmo detainees began during the presidency of George W. Bush in 2005 when nearly 200 detainees were released before any tribunals were held.According to a March 2015 memo released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, of the 647 detainees transferred or released, 17.9 percent were confirmed of re-engaging in extremist activity with another 10.7 percent suspected of doing the same.

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The speaker of Indonesia s parliament, who is being investigated for his suspected involvement in a $170 million graft scandal, has tendered his resignation, two members of the assembly said on Monday. Setya Novanto was arrested last month over his suspected role in the scandal linked to a national electronic identity card scheme. Anti-corruption investigators then took him into custody from where he sent a letter to assembly leaders pleading to be allowed to keep his job while he fought the charges.  Mr Novanto has resigned,  member of parliament Yandri Susanto told Reuters, referring to a letter in which Novanto announced his decision.  He didn t say why.  A replacement for him as speaker was expected to be decided by his party, Golkar, at an extraordinary meeting on Dec. 19, said Dito Ganinduto, a member of parliament from Novanto s Golkar party. Novanto had not resigned as chairman of Golkar, Ganinduto said. A lawyer for Novanto, Maqdir Ismail, deferred questions on the matter to acting Golkar chairman Idrus Marham. Marham could not be reached for comment. Novanto had clung to power through several previous corruption cases. His latest battle with the graft agency has gripped Indonesia, where newspapers have splashed the story on front pages and social media posts mocking him have been widely shared.  Before his detention last month he had for months declined to answer summonses for questioning by the Corruption Eradication Commission, known by its Indonesian initials KPK. The allegations against Novanto have reinforced the perception among Indonesians that their parliament, long regarded as riddled with entrenched corruption, is a failing institution. Indonesia was ranked last year at 90 out of 176 countries on Transparency International s corruption perception index. The watchdog has singled out parliament as Indonesia s most corrupt institution, and in July called on President Joko Widodo to protect the KPK against attempts by the legislature to weaken the commission s powers. Critics inside and outside the parliament say the root problem is money politics. ",1
"DETROIT (Reuters) - A federal judge halted late on Monday the deportation of all Iraqi nationals detained during immigration sweeps across the United States this month until at least July 10, expanding a stay he imposed last week. The stay had initially only protected 114 detainees from the Detroit area. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith sided with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union who filed an amended complaint on Saturday seeking to prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from deporting Iraqis from anywhere in the United States.  The ACLU argued those being deported could face persecution, torture, or death because many were Chaldean Catholics, Sunni Muslims, or Iraqi Kurds and that the groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq. Goldsmith agreed with the ACLU on the grave consequences deportees may face, writing in his seven-page opinion and order that: “Such harm far outweighs any interest the Government may have in proceeding with the removals immediately.” On Thursday, Goldsmith ordered a stay in the Michigan Iraqis’ deportation for at least two weeks while he decided whether he had jurisdiction over the merits of deporting immigrants who could face physical danger in their countries of origin. He expanded his stay on Monday to the broader class of Iraqi nationals nationwide, saying it applies to the removal of all Iraqi nationals in the United States with final orders of removal who have been or will be detained by ICE. There are 1,444 Iraqi nationals who have final deportation orders against them, although only 199 of them were detained as part of a nationwide sweep by immigration authorities, federal prosecutors said in court on Monday. Those detained had convictions for serious crimes, including rape and kidnapping, ICE said. Goldsmith also said his stays were designed to give detainees time to find legal representation to appeal against their deportation orders, and to give him time to weigh the question of his jurisdiction. Daniel Lemisch, acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, called the opinion “highly extraordinary.” “But it’s a very extraordinary circumstance because of the on-the-ground situation in Iraq,” Lemisch said by phone, referring to the danger faced by possible deportees.  ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt praised the ruling for saying that “the lives of these individuals should not depend on what part of the United States they reside and whether they could find a lawyer to file a federal court action.” Goldsmith’s order came the same day the U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory to President Donald Trump by reviving parts of a travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries. The roundup in Michigan followed Iraq’s agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from Trump’s revised temporary travel ban. Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to the agreement in March. ",1
"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri rescinded his resignation on Tuesday, drawing a line under a month-long crisis triggered when he announced from Riyadh that he was stepping down and remained outside Lebanon for weeks. His coalition government, which includes the Iran-backed Hezbollah group, reaffirmed a state policy of staying out of conflicts in Arab states. Hariri s Saudi allies accuse Hezbollah of waging war across the Middle East as agents of Iran. Hariri s shock resignation had thrust Lebanon to the forefront of the regional quarrel between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has been played out on battlefields in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Lebanese officials said Saudi Arabia had coerced Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally, into resigning and put him under effective house arrest until an intervention by France led to his return to Lebanon. Saudi Arabia and Hariri have denied this. President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, refused to accept his resignation while he remained abroad. Saudi concern over the influence wielded by Shi ite Muslim Iran and Hezbollah in other Arab states had been widely seen as the root cause of the crisis, which raised fears for Lebanon s economic and political stability.  The Lebanese policy of  dissociation  was declared in 2012 to keep the deeply divided state out of regional conflicts such as the civil war in neighbouring Syria. Despite the policy, Hezbollah is heavily involved there, sending thousands of fighters to help President Bashar al-Assad. In its first meeting since Hariri s resignation, the cabinet on Tuesday reaffirmed its commitment to the policy.   All (the government s) political components decide to dissociate themselves from all conflicts, disputes, wars or the internal affairs of brother Arab countries, in order to preserve Lebanon s economic and political relations,  Hariri said. Lebanon, where Sunni Muslim, Shi ite, Christian and Druze groups fought a civil war from 1975-1990, has a governing system designed to share power among sectarian groups. Hariri, a wealthy Sunni businessman with long ties to the kingdom, had denounced Iran during his resignation speech and said he was outside Lebanon because he feared for his family s safety. His father, an ex-prime minister, was assassinated in 2005. In a speech during the cabinet session, Hariri warned that the tensions in the region could easily drag Lebanon down a dangerous route, and the issues which had led to the crisis could not be ignored.  Developments in the region suggest a new wave of conflict ... Perhaps the conflict is nearing the end, and Lebanon cannot be plunged into chaos on the finish line.  If we are rejecting interference by any state in Lebanese affairs, it cannot be that we accept that any Lebanese side interferes in the affairs of Arab states,  Hariri said, an apparent reference to Hezbollah.  We have to address this issue, and take a decision announcing our disassociation, in words and deeds,  he said.     Hariri s resignation was accompanied by a sharp escalation in Saudi statements targeting the Lebanese state, with Riyadh at one point accusing the Beirut government of declaring war against it. Western governments, including the United States, stressed their support for Hariri and Lebanon.  Hariri will be in Paris on Friday for a meeting of the International Lebanon Support Group, a body that includes the five members of the U.N. Security Council - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. The meeting, to be opened by French President Emmanuel Macron, aims in part to put pressure on Saudi Arabia and Iran to desist from interference in Lebanon, diplomats said.

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian Defense Ministry on Tuesday denied allegations that its air strikes had killed civilians in Syria s Idlib province, saying that in recent days it had only bombed Islamist militant fighters in the area. Moscow said it was responding to assertions from the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which on Monday said six civilians had been killed in the province, including a woman and a child.  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu criticized Moscow on Monday for the same reason, saying that recent Russian bombing in Idlib had killed civilians and moderate rebels and that this would be discussed with Russian President Vladimir Putin when he visited Turkey this week. Putin is expected to meet his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Thursday for talks on Syria. Major-General Igor Konashenkov of the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the Russian and Syrian air forces did not bomb residential areas and accused the observatory of making up allegations and of sympathizing with radical Islamist militants.  In the last few days, after drone reconnaissance and confirmation via other channels, Russian planes struck 10 terrorist targets in Idlib Province,  Konashenkov said.   These were militant bases, ammunition stores, armored vehicles, rocket systems, and workshops fitting out  jihad jeeps  which were located a long way from residential areas,  he said. Konashenkov said Russia had data to confirm the accuracy of its attacks and the ministry on Tuesday published video of the strikes on Idlib to back its assertions that it had only bombed militant targets. The targets struck had taken part in a militant offensive on Sept. 18 which had surrounded 29 Russian military policemen who then had to be broken out in an operation backed by air power, he added.

"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe takes its next step into the post-Mugabe era soon, when its new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, names two vice presidents - appointments that will signal whether he is breaking with the country s old guard. Mnangagwa, whose sacking as vice-president triggered the removal of Robert Mugabe, made no comments to the media on Wednesday before the first meeting of the ruling ZANU-PF party s bosses. Party spokesman Simon Khaya-Moyo has said he will choose his deputies either this week or later. Khaya-Moyo told reporters after the meeting that Mnangagwa assured senior party officials they would serve their full terms, comments that allayed concerns of a purge of the G40 faction loyal to Mugabe and his wife, Grace. Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko, who was considered an ally of the G40, has already been sacked from the party and his post, and some Mnangagwa supporters have called for unspecified action against G40. But the president has urged citizens not to undertake any form of  vengeful retribution . Party and government officials have refused to comment on speculation in privately owned newspapers and on social media that Mnangagwa is likely to make military chief General Constantine Chiwenga one of his deputies, as a reward for spearheading the de facto coup that ended Mugabe s rule. The new president has been criticized by some Zimbabweans and opposition parties for appointing Air Marshall Perrance Shiri as lands, agriculture and rural resettlement minister and Major-General Sibusiso Moyo as foreign and international trade minister, rather than bringing in younger candidates less associated with the Mugabe era. Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa, who is the party s legal affairs secretary, presented a report on the economy at Wednesday s meeting, where he reiterated that the  new dispensation  in the country had brought hope and confidence in the economy, Khaya-Moyo said. Chinamasa promised in a budget speech last week to re-engage with international lenders, curb spending and attract investors to revive the economy.  Mnangagwa is under pressure to reverse the economic decline before elections next year and has vowed to focus on rejuvenating the struggling economy and creating jobs. Once seen among Africa s most promising economies, Zimbabwe now has an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent. ",1

"Just hours before Donald Trump s new Muslim ban was set to go into effect, a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the executive order. U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled on Wednesday afternoon that the travel ban still doesn t still doesn t pass legal muster. The illogic of the Government s contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,  Watson wrote. Equally flawed is the notion that the Executive Order cannot be found to have targeted Islam because it applies to all individuals in the six referenced countries,  Watson added.  It is undisputed, using the primary source upon which the Government itself relies, that these six countries have overwhelmingly Muslim populations that range from 90.7% to 99.8%. It would therefore be no paradigmatic leap to conclude that targeting these countries likewise targets Islam,  Watson added.  Certainly, it would be inappropriate to conclude, as the Government does, that it does not. Trump then proceeded to fly into a rage during a campaign rally in Nashville, Tennessee. (Yes, this man is seriously still holding campaign rallies. But I digress.) While speaking, Trump said the ruling was  terrible  and promised to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court if he had to. We re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court,  Trump said. We re going to win. The danger is clear. The law is clear. The need for my executive order is clear. Obviously fuming over the decision, Trump insisted that Judge Watson ruled against his Muslim ban for  political reasons.  After all, it simply couldn t be because it s based on bigotry. Trump said that this  makes us look weak  when it comes to fighting terrorism.According to Trump, his latest attempt to ban Muslims from the country was tailored to the dictates of the flawed ruling  on his first ban. This is a watered-down version of the first one,  Trump said.  And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to to in the first place. Trump also whined that he couldn t say the things he really wanted to say about the judge s decision to halt his bigoted ban because he would be  criticized. I have to be nice otherwise I ll be criticized for speaking poorly about our courts,  he told the crowd.  Among the most dishonest people in the world, I will be criticized.

"UNITED NATIONS/COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump wants the United Nations Security Council to take  strong and swift action  to end violence against Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims, Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday, declaring the crisis a threat to the world. Speaking at a Security Council meeting on peacekeeping reform, Pence accused the Myanmar military of responding to militant attacks on government outposts  with terrible savagery, burning villages, driving the Rohingya from their homes.   Unless this violence is stopped, which justice demands, it will only get worse. And it will sow seeds of hatred and chaos that may well consume the region for generations to come and threaten the peace of us all,  Pence said. Pence s remarks were the strongest U.S. government response yet to the violence in Myanmar s Rakhine state that began on Aug. 25 and forced 422,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh, fleeing a military offensive the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. Even so, the chances of forceful action by the world body appear scant. Diplomats say the Security Council could consider adopting a formal statement if the situation does not improve, but China and Russia are unlikely to agree to stronger action that would require the adoption of a resolution they could veto.  A U.N. Security Council resolution would need nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France.  Myanmar said earlier this month it was negotiating with veto powers China and Russia to ensure their protection. China, which has close economic and diplomatic ties with Myanmar and is a competitor to the United States for influence in the strategically important country, has called for understanding of the government s efforts to protect stability. U.S. officials, for their part, have said that any return to sanctions imposed when Myanmar was under military rule is unlikely.      Pence repeated a U.S. call for the Myanmar military to end the violence and support diplomatic efforts for a long-term solution for the Rohingya, who are denied citizenship in a country where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants. The 15-member U.N. Security Council has met twice behind closed doors since the Rohingya crisis began on Aug. 25 and last week issued an informal statement to the press condemning the situation and urging Myanmar authorities to end the violence. Pence s stark warning suggested Washington was concerned the crisis could spiral into the kind of sectarian, or religious, conflict plaguing parts of the Middle East and South Asia, where militants like Islamic State and al Qaeda gained a foothold.    It comes at a time when the Trump administration has been seeking to limit refugees entering the United States and to ban travel from six Muslim-majority countries. Trump has argued that the ban is needed to prevent terrorist attacks and to allow the government to put in place more stringent vetting procedures. The violence began when Rohingya insurgents attacked about 30 police posts and an army camp, killing about 12 people. Iran s President Hassan Rouhani told a news conference in New York on Wednesday that  the government should be pressured to end this ethnic cleansing.  French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned  unacceptable ethnic cleaning  on Tuesday and pushed for U.N. Security Council action.  In her speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May urged the Myanmar authorities to end the violence and allow full humanitarian aid access.  Pence said the United States welcomed comments by Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a national address on Tuesday that returning refugees have nothing to fear. Suu Kyi s assurances were reiterated on Wednesday at the annual United Nations General Assembly by Myanmar s Vice President Henry Van Thio, who said security forces had been instructed to take  full measures  to avoid collateral damage and harming innocent civilians. But Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh said on Wednesday they took little hope from the 1991 Nobel peace laureate s speech.   I have no hope to go back. My documents were stripped from my forefathers decades ago,  said Shafi Rahman, 45. He said he had arrived in Bangladesh two weeks ago after soldiers and civilian mobs burned his village. Rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes responded with violence and arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population. Myanmar rejects the charge, saying its forces are tackling insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who it has accused of setting the fires and attacking civilians. Van Thio said the government was concerned by reports that Muslims were continuing to cross into Bangladesh even though there had been no armed clashes since Sept. 5 and added:  We would need to find out the reason for this exodus.  Smoke could be seen rising from at least two places in Myanmar on Wednesday, a Reuters reporter in Bangladesh said. It was not known what was burning but rights groups say almost half of Rohingya villages in the region have been torched. In her Tuesday speech, Suu Kyi condemned abuses and said all violators would be punished, adding that she was committed to the restoration of peace and the rule of law. However, she did not address U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing by the security forces, drawing a cool international response. Suu Kyi has for years been feted in the West as a champion of democracy during years of military rule and house arrest but she has faced growing criticism over the plight of the Rohingya. Western diplomats and aid officials had hoped to see unequivocal condemnation of violence and hate speech in her address. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy is in Myanmar and is due to meet government officials and representatives of different communities in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine state. The United States said on Wednesday it would provide an additional $32 million in humanitarian assistance to help deal with the crisis, bringing its total assistance for refugees from Burma in the region to nearly $95 million for fiscal 2017.  We applaud the government of Bangladesh s generosity in responding to this severe humanitarian crisis and appreciate their continued efforts to ensure assistance reaches people in need,  the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said she talked to  Trump on Monday about Rohingya Muslims flooding into her country, but expected no help from him as he has made clear how he feels about refugees.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia welcomed on Friday the release of classified pages of the official report on the Sept. 11 attacks, and hoped their release would clear up suspicions about Riyadh’s actions, intentions or long-term friendship with the United States. “Since 2002, the 9/11 Commission and several government agencies, including the CIA and the FBI, have investigated the contents of the ‘28 Pages’ and have confirmed that neither the Saudi government, nor senior Saudi officials, nor any person acting on behalf of the Saudi government provided any support or encouragement for these attacks,” Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States, Abdullah al-Saud, said in a statement. “We hope the release of these pages will clear up, once and for all, any lingering questions or suspicions about Saudi Arabia’s actions, intentions, or long-term friendship with the United States.” ",1
"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Benghazi s commercial port officially reopened on Sunday after a three-year closure due to fighting between rival factions in the east Libyan city. To mark the opening Abdullah al-Thinni, prime minister of a government based in the east, arrived on board a tanker sent from the eastern city of Tobruk. The port does not export oil, but imports gas and some petroleum products as well as general cargo, and local costs for these would be reduced by the port s reopening, port spokesman Nasser Al-Maghrabi said.      Today Benghazi port opened and a tanker from Tobruk entered as a message to the world that the port is safe and we are ready to receive tankers,  port manager Abdulazim Al-Abbar said by telephone.  Until now we have not received notification of tankers arriving for exports and imports - for now we are starting up and waiting.    Like Benghazi s airport, the port had been closed since 2014 because of a conflict between forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar and an alliance of Islamists and other opponents. Haftar declared victory in early July, though isolated skirmishes continued. Benghazi airport reopened in mid-July. ",1
"Obama has shown favoritism towards the Muslim Brotherhood terror group almost since the first day of his presidency. Many are convinced Obama is tied to the terror group through his brother, and his desire to prevent Americans from referring to this group as a  terror group  doesn t do much to convince us he doesn t have some sort of ties to them. Obama quietly offered his support when the riots Arab Spring uprisings took place in Egypt, paving the way for the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist, Mohamed Morsy to take over as President of Egypt through  fair  elections The House Judiciary Committee passed a bill on Wednesday calling on the State Department to classify the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group, by a 17-10 party-line vote.The GOP leadership under Speaker Paul Ryan supports the legislation, a high-ranking Republican source told the Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT) on background. This makes floor passage more likely.The bill states that it is the  sense of Congress that the Muslim Brotherhood meets the criteria for classification as a foreign terrorist organization. Under the bill as amended by committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Secretary of State John Kerry would have 60 days to issue a detailed report to Congress indicating whether the Brotherhood meets the criteria qualifying it as a terrorist group. The Brotherhood s strategic goal in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and  sabotaging  its miserable house from within so that it is eliminated and God s religion is made victorious over all other religions,  Goodlatte said, quoting the Brotherhood s 1991 Explanatory Memorandum, in a statement given before the vote.Here is Muslim terror expert, Brigitte Gabriel explaining the plan by the Muslim Brotherhood to jihad in North America. After watching this, you may ask yourself what has taken Congress so long to act? The Brotherhood and its leaders and affiliates, such as Hamas, have supported Islamist terrorism   directly, through fundraising, and through exhortation. Each of these activities constitutes an act of terrorism under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under the bill, the Obama Administration would be forced to deny admittance to any foreign national tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.Since Obama became President, people connected to the Muslim Brotherhood have received entry visas despite their open support for terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.There are many who believe the Muslim Brotherhood has been given special treatment by our very own  President,  and that he is somehow tied to the group:HERE, Rep Louie Gohmert (R-TX) is asking why the Obama regime gave $1.5 BILLION to the Muslim Brotherhood:Previously banned individuals such as Sheikh Rached Ghannouchi, head of Tunisia s branch of the Brotherhood, and Tariq Ramadan, grandson of Brotherhood founder Hasan al-Banna, have been welcomed to the US by the Obama Administration despite their vocal support for Hamas. Ramadan fought his ban on entering the US in court, and won an appeal.Other foreign Brotherhood speakers such as Ragheb Elsergany exploit the platform given to them by the Obama Administration to advocate for Muslims to support Palestinian  mujahideen  fighting against Israel.If the Brotherhood were designated as a terrorist group, it would be a crime for people in the United Sates to provide material support to it, and the Treasury Department could force banks to block financial transactions related to the Brotherhood. The bill lists US groups, including the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), and the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), as groups under the control of the international Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood continues to pose a global threat. The jihadist movement actively supports and finances terrorist networks around the world, including al-Qaida and Hamas. The United States must recognize and sanction the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization as part of our national security strategy,  co-sponsor Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, (R-Fla.), said in a statement. Via: The Alemeiner ",0
"LONDON (Reuters) - One of the  Chennai Six  group of ex-British soldiers jailed in India was dragged to a psychiatric hospital and force-fed anti-psychotic tablets during his time in jail, a London court considering whether to extradite Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya was told on Thursday. Mallya, 61, is wanted in India on fraud and money-laundering charges relating to his defunct Kingfisher Airlines and Indian authorities want to recover about $1.4 billion they say Kingfisher owes.  The businessman, co-owner of the Force India Formula One team, who moved to Britain in March last year, says the case him is politically motivated and is fighting extradition on several grounds including a claim that jail conditions in India are incompatible with British human rights laws. As part of this, his lawyer quizzed prison conditions expert  Dr Alan Mitchell about a conversation he had had two days ago with one of the former British soldiers who had been held for four years in India on weapons-smuggling charges after the vessel they were working on strayed into Indian waters in 2013. The soldiers were released from jail in Chennai, eastern India, after a successful appeal and began arriving back in Britain last week. The ex-soldier, named only as  A , said he had been grabbed by 15 prison guards and prisoners and taken to a psychiatric hospital because he had been  excessively walking  around the prison, Mitchell told London s Westminster Magistrate Court.  While in the psychiatric hospital, he stated he was tied up, gagged, he was beaten and he was forcibly injected. In addition he described being force-fed anti-psychotic tablets that he managed to spit out,  Mitchell said. Asked by Mallya s lawyer Clare Montgomery about assurances given over the treatment of Mallya, who she said had diabetes, coronary artery disease and sleep apnoea, Mitchell said the British government had likewise told parliament that the Chennai Six were being well looked after.  Despite assurances having been given in parliament,  A  was extremely disappointed by what effect the involvement of the High Commission and the UK government had on conditions in which he and his fellow prisoners were held,  he said. Mark Summers, the lawyer representing the Indian government, said Mitchell s evidence involved an uncorroborated account which could be used as a  platform for a compensation claim against the UK government . He said conditions in Chennai would bear no relation to the jail in Mumbai where Mallya would be held. Another hearing in the London extradition case against Mallya will be held on Jan. 10 with a decision expected at a later date. ",1

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese authorities on Monday arrested a Japanese citizen suspected of spying, local state media said. The arrest was made in the port city of Dalian in the northeastern Liaoning province, which borders North Korea, the official Dalian Daily s online report said. The report said Ken Higuchi was being investigated by the Dalian City National Security Bureau on suspicion of spying against China, and that prosecutors had approved his arrest. The character given for Higuchi s first name could also be the names Takeshi or Takeru. It was unclear from the report, however, whether Higuchi was a new case or whether he had been detained earlier, and the latest development was his formal arrest. China detained six Japanese nationals in March on suspicion of illegal activities. Four of the six returned to Japan in July, three of whom were there doing geological research into hotsprings, according to their employer. China s foreign ministry also in July said that a single Japanese citizen was being investigated on suspicion of harming China s national security. Reuters was unable to contact Japan s foreign ministry by telephone. Monday was a national holiday in Japan. China s relationship with Japan has been strained for decades over the legacy of Japan s wartime aggression, while a maritime territorial dispute over small islands in the East China Sea has in recent years added to the suspicion between the two sides. In 2010, four Japanese nationals were detained in China on suspicion of entering a military zone and taking photographs without permission. At least two Japanese citizens were arrested on suspicion of espionage in 2015. Last year, China said it was investigating a Japanese citizen on suspicion of endangering national security. ",1
"BERLIN (Reuters) - One month away from a national election, Germany s Social Democrats are struggling in their efforts to narrow a yawning gap in support behind Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives. The left-leaning Social Democratic Party (SPD) is languishing on around 24 percent support, polls show, far behind Merkel s conservatives bloc, on some 38 percent. Germans go to the polls on Sept. 24. The SPD is having difficulty in differentiating itself from the conservatives, with whom it rules as junior partner in a  grand coalition  - an alliance the party wants to avoid repeating, but which polls suggest is the only partnership that can guarantee a majority.  We need to get more emotional, to fight and force Merkel to speak in clear terms so that the differences become clear,  SPD Labour Minister Andrea Nahles told business daily Handelsblatt. Nahles accused Merkel, who is campaigning for a fourth term on a platform of economic stability, of trying to cruise through the election without staking out clear positions. Last year, Germany s refugee crisis threatened Merkel. But with the migrant flow now stemmed and unemployment at a record low, she is able to project herself as an anchor of stability in an uncertain world. Trying to rock her, SPD leader Martin Schulz has grown increasingly critical of Merkel this week, accusing her of blocking his party s efforts in the ruling coalition to win better pay for temporary workers and improve workers  rights. On Thursday, Schulz takes his campaign to Essen, in the heart of the Ruhr area of North Rhine-Westphalia that was at the center of Germany s post-war  economic miracle  but which is now a rust-belt. Germany s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia has traditionally been an SPD stronghold but the party lost there in a state election in May - one of three regional votes Merkel s conservatives won earlier this year. Schulz, 61, led the SPD to a brief poll surge after the party selected him as leader at the start of the year. But the revival quickly fizzled as his campaign for  social justice  failed to gain traction. A former European Parliament president, he cannot match the clout of Merkel, 63, gained in 12 years of experience as leader of Europe s biggest economy. Searching for another point of difference, Schulz pledged on Tuesday to have U.S. nuclear weapons withdrawn from German territory if, against the odds, he defeats Merkel.  Schulz s election campaign is jumping around so many areas that it is impossible to discern a theme,  the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung wrote in an editorial. Striking a defeatist note, Schulz said earlier this month he wanted to stay on as SPD leader even if his party loses the election. ",1

"LONDON (Reuters) - Northern Ireland s main political parties pointed on Tuesday to fresh obstacles to restoring a devolved power-sharing government in the British region after meeting Prime Minister Theresa May, who urged them to resume talks next week. The province has been without a regional government for almost a year, destabilizing the delicate balance between Irish nationalists and pro-British unionists that has already been shaken by Britain s vote to leave the European Union. The latest efforts at breaking the stalemate in Belfast collapsed this month, prompting Britain to begin setting a budget for the province, a major step toward imposing direct rule from London for the first time in a decade. The head of the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Arlene Foster accused Irish nationalist rival Sinn Fein - the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army - of the  glorification of terrorism  in a party conference last weekend.  Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in turn accused May of  acting in bad faith  by including a potential statute of limitations covering crimes by British forces in a planned consultation on new laws to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland s 30 years of sectarian violence. May struck a more positive tone, saying the issues dividing the parties were relatively few and that she believed an agreement could be reached. In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that if an administration could not be formed, he would seek a meeting in the New Year of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, a joint decision making body recognizing the Irish government s special interest in Northern Ireland that last met a decade ago.    Analysts have said a fresh round of talks is unlikely to be even contemplated until after both parties  annual conferences, culminating with the DUP s meeting on Saturday. The DUP has said it was upset by prolonged cheering at Sinn Fein s annual conference at the weekend after MP Elisha McCallion spoke of former Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness  pride in his role in the IRA.  The IRA killed hundreds in its campaign against British rule before a ceasefire in 1994. Around 3,600 died on all sides in the conflict, fought over whether Northern Ireland should be part of the United Kingdom or Ireland, before it ended with a 1998 peace agreement.  It was quite disgraceful to look at the glorification that happened at the weekend of the IRA and terrorism and of course that makes it more difficult for us,  Foster, whose father narrowly escaped alive from an IRA shooting, told reporters. Foster, who warned ahead of the talks that further steps toward direct rule looked inevitable unless there is a change of direction, said her party remained committed to devolution. ",1

"21st Century Wire says  The mainstream media have gone to great lengths to hide obfuscate the following story.During an interview with CBS News on March 7, 2015, President Barack Obama claimed he only learned about Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server,  the same time everybody else learned it through news reports. Subsequent email leaks show, however, that Obama in fact lied when he said he  didn t know  Clinton used an unsecure private server. According to the Daily Caller, newly released FBI documents show that: Obama used a pseudonym when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton s private email server. This proves two things: not only did Obama break White House security protocol by carelessly trading private emails  off grid  with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server   but he also lied about it after the fact.(NOTE: This would not have been as big of an issue for Obama had he simply not commented on the issue, or actually told the truth, but this is president who struggles on both those fronts) COVER-UP: Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey, and President Obama.This leads us to the FBI  led by its director and elite fixer, James Comey, the FBI carefully whitewashed over the Clinton email case   to protect the President. Cleary, the FBI and the DOJ closed ranks to protect the President, but  from what  you might ask? This is why: any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as  born classified.   The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers.It also proves that Hillary Clinton is lied when she claimed that  no classified emails  lived on her private server. They both lied.From the beginning of this scandal, at every turn it seems, the Democratic Party nominee has lied about having classified emails on her unauthorized private server, and this week we discover that one of her State Department operatives, Patrick Kennedy, tried to shield her culpability by asking the FBI to downgrade the classification of certain emails in exchange for  quid pro quo  political favors.Maybe it s an attitude certain people in Washington have (especially if they are the party in power), that they are  above the law  and not subject to the same rules as their lessers in Washington. But the fact remains: both Clinton and Obama lied to the American people, but let off by a corrupt US media who appear to be more concerned about getting Clinton elected   than holding any Washington s power elite accountable.According to Clinton though, all this is somehow  Vladimir Putin s fault.

"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday: Trump endorses Republican legislation to replace the Obamacare healthcare law, but it faces a rebellion by conservative groups and lawmakers who denounce it, complicating its chances for congressional approval. The House Republican health insurance plan suggests post-Obamacare health insurance will be less affordable, investors, insurers and industry sources say, raising questions about future enrollment and insurance company participation. Large U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology company shares sell off after Trump says he is working on a system to reduce drug prices. Senate Democrats, seeking to capitalize on revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russia, urge a top Republican lawmaker to obtain the president’s tax returns as a matter of national security. The lawyer who will take over an investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, if he wins Senate confirmation to become deputy attorney general, rebuffs Democrats’ demands for the appointment of a special prosecutor in the case. The Senate Armed Services Committee overwhelmingly approves Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster as Trump’s second national security adviser, despite concern about his handling of a sexual assault case. White House spokesman Sean Spicer says he has no reason to think Trump does not support FBI Director James Comey after a dispute over the president’s allegation without evidence that he was wiretapped last year. The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee says he has seen no evidence to support Trump’s allegation he was wiretapped by then-President Barack Obama during the 2016 presidential campaign. The Trump administration pledges in a statement to show “great strictness” over restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities imposed by a deal with major powers but gives little indication of what that might mean for the agreement. The United States starts deploying the first elements of its advanced anti-missile defense system in South Korea after North Korea’s test of four ballistic missiles, U.S. Pacific Command says, despite angry opposition from China.

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian petrochemical holding Sibur said on Monday it had no direct dealings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and that its ties to its partners were not in breach of sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis. Sibur was commenting on reports that Ross has kept investments in Navigator Holdings, a shipping firm which has supplied services to Sibur. Stakeholders in Sibur include an associate of Russian Vladimir Putin who is subject to U.S. sanctions. In a statement, Sibur said that in the first half of this year, Sibur spent $15.9 million on services provided by Navigator, or 2.8 percent of Sibur’s overall expenditure on logistics. It said Navigator was never a sole contractor for shipping Sibur’s petrochemical products. “All negotiations and meetings were held solely by Sibur management and solely with management of those companies (which were shipping Sibur’s liquefied petroleum gas) and without shareholders’ involvement,” Sibur said in an emailed statement. “In connection with the introduction in 2014 of sanctions with regard to one of the company’s shareholders, our counter-parties conducted all necessary checks into whether there were any restrictions on working with Sibur. No such restrictions were found,” the statement said. “Sibur expresses its surprise at the politically-charged interpretation in certain media publications of regular commercial activities, over many years, which from the outset were reflected in the company’s published accounts.” Sibur’s shareholders include Gennady Timchenko, a close Putin ally who has been under U.S. sanctions since 2014. Another Sibur shareholder is Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov. Shamalov did not reply to an email from Reuters seeking  comment. Spokesman for Volga Group, an investment vehicle for Timchenko’s assets, declined to comment.  The New York Times and other publications, citing leaked documents from an offshore law firm, reported that partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings. Reuters has not independently verified the documents. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has found at least one Democrat willing to entertain his tax reform pitch: Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who plans to travel with him on Air Force One on Wednesday to a tax event in her home state. Trump is trying to persuade Democrats to support his push to cut tax rates and simplify the tax code this year, a plan critical to bolstering Republicans heading into 2018 midterm elections, but which so far has included few details. The White House plans to put Trump out on the road on a near-weekly basis this fall to sell his plan, which faces huge obstacles in Congress. Republicans control Congress but have so far been unable to pass Trump’s top legislative priorities. He has appealed to Democrats to help, but lawmakers from the party are furious about his recent comments about white supremacists and his move on Tuesday to end a program that gave work permits to some immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children. Last week, Trump made his first major tax reform speech in Missouri, urging voters to reject that state’s Democratic U.S. senator, Claire McCaskill, in the 2018 midterm elections unless she supports tax reform. Similarly, Wednesday’s speech is aimed in part at Heitkamp, a Democrat up for re-election in a Republican stronghold, who has been willing to buck her party in the past. “Both of the Reagan tax cuts were passed by a Democratic majority in the House (of Representatives), a Democratic speaker, and the vast majority of Democrats in the Senate, including a Democratic senator from the great state of North Dakota,” Trump will say, according to excerpts released by the White House. On Friday, Heitkamp said both parties need to work together on tax reform, which she views as critical for businesses and families in her state. “I hope President Trump uses this visit to address the kitchen-table issues that keep the North Dakotans I’ve met with across the state this past month up at night,” Heitkamp said in a statement. Trump’s political push on tax reform will get an assist from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbying group, which is set to begin a multimillion-dollar, multi-state campaign in New York on Thursday, a Republican familiar with the plan said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The campaign will be aimed at Republican members of Congress and some members of the conservative Freedom Caucus. “It talks about the need for a sense of urgency, the need to change tax loopholes, the need for family tax relief, and it’s got to happen now,” the official said.

"Judge Jeanine Pirro SLAMS Hillary Clinton after Clinton blamed WikiLeaks and Jim Comey s letter on October 28th for losing the election to President Trump.Judge Jeanine called Clinton a  loser  and told her to go back into the woods Hillary, snap out of it,  Pirro said.  I m tired of going through this with you. You re a two-time loser who lost because you were a lousy candidate, you didn t have a message, you lied every time you opened your mouth; you didn t know what states to campaign in, you put our national security at risk with your amateur email setup, you were in a foundation that was nothing more than an organized criminal enterprise parading as a charity, four men died under your watch as you lied about a video, and there were a billion dollars missing from the State Department when you left. And I could go on and on, but I just don t have the time. So, stop with the poor me nonsense. We ve had it with you Clintons always claiming victimhood. The two of you haven t followed the rules since the day you both showed up in your bell bottoms in Arkansas. Be careful, Hillary. Be very, very careful. You pulled the wool over Jim Comey s eyes once, and you actually got the president to say you re a nice lady. Don t be so sure you re going to get away with your new game, given your illegal, ill-advised, and incompetent instincts.You re a loser, Hillary. Face it. Face it, and get back in the woods! ",0
"The rumors that Hillary Clinton is sick have been flying around the right as conservatives desperately search for any way possible to take her down and elevate the disaster that is Donald Trump. Even Katrina Pierson tried to claim that Hillary has a  rare brain disease  with no evidence whatsoever. These not-so lovely people point to videos of her coughing and appearing to have a seizure, criticize her for getting helped up some stairs, and even claim that her glasses are evidence that she s gravely ill.Rudy Giuliani, who s increasingly extreme and will do anything to remain endeared to Donald Trump, earned a lot of flak for claiming that Hillary Clinton is sick, too, without a any evidence other than online videos. The Washington Post decided to hit Giuliani back on that with an op-ed titled,  Is Rudy Giuliani Okay? The first three paragraphs of the op-ed are both scathing and sarcastic, and perfect for what Giuliani has done: During his 15-minute speech at the GOP convention last month in Cleveland, it was notable that when he said Donald Trump loves  all people, from the top to the bottom,  Mr. Giuliani animatedly gestured toward his knees as he said  top,  and above his head as he said  bottom.  Also, why did he say that he and his wife, Judith, have been friends with Mr. Trump for 30 years, though he met his wife in 1999, only 17 years ago?Also   we re noting this purely out of concern   during his speech he often licked his lips, indicating dry mouth, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, can be a symptom of nerve damage, stroke or Alzheimer s disease. At the end of his address, beads of sweat were visible on his pate   did that not suggest heart disease?Mr. Giuliani is just 72, but he seemed slightly stooped as he walked to the lectern, where his wide stance made us wonder if he s unsteady on his feet. Then there was his slurred diction, as when he referred to  jushtified  police shootings and Syrian  refyoongees.  More evidence of a stroke? Come to think of it, Giuliani did look a bit decrepit at the convention, didn t he?See how he can t seem to stand up straight? (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) And what is up with that squint? Did he have a a stroke that affected his vision? (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)We can make ludicrous claims like Giuliani, too.The Post wanted to give Giuliani and the rest of the right wing a taste of what it s like for people who aren t doctors of any sort, let alone their doctors, tell the world that they re obviously ill. The truth, however, is that we actually have less cause to question Hillary s health than The Donald s, because Hillary has had a real medical exam and released it.Trump, however, has not. The record he released was a complete sham (like literally everything else he s done), his doctor is a quack at best, and, like his taxes, he won t release his actual health records. So how are we to know how healthy he really is, despite his quack s assertions that he d be the healthiest president ever?Of course, the Post acknowledges that their assessment of Giuliani s health is ridiculous, as they should and as we did above. Their goal was to put the entire  Ermagherd Herllery ers serck  crowd on the right in their place, and they did an outstanding job of it.So how does it feel to have someone who is not your doctor, or a doctor of any kind, diagnosing you with health problems based solely on how you appeared on television, Mr. Giuliani?Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",0
"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet former U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday morning to discuss the political crisis in Northern Ireland, May s spokesman said. During his time as president, Clinton played a central role in brokering peace in the British province, where a power-sharing administration collapsed in January and opposing sides have since been unable to break the political deadlock. Clinton traveled to Belfast this week to meet political parties and try to break the impasse.  He and the PM wanted to take this opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland ..,  May s spokesman said.  Obviously work is ongoing in trying to reach a solution and to get the compromises that are necessary to get the devolved administration up and running again,  he added. Earlier the British government minister for the province said the chances of reaching a deal there were  not positive .  The meeting with Clinton is due to take place at 0830 GMT in May s Downing Street office. ",1
" (Corrects this Nov. 14 to clarify details of Bolton’s recess appointment, paragraph 8.) By Warren Strobel and John Walcott WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite his professed opposition to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, President-elect Donald Trump is considering several of the major advocates of that war for top national security posts in his administration, according to Republican officials. Among those who could find places on Trump’s team are former top State Department official John Bolton and ex-CIA Director James Woolsey. Both men championed the Iraq invasion, which many analysts have called one of the major U.S. foreign policy debacles of modern times. Also involved in transition planning for Trump’s presidency is Frederick Fleitz, a top aide to Bolton who earlier worked at the CIA unit that validated much of the flawed intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs. Although it is impossible to predict how a Trump foreign policy might evolve, one U.S. official who has served in Iraq said advocates of the 2003 invasion might be more inclined to commit additional U.S. forces to the fight against Islamic State there, despite the absence of a status of forces agreement that protects Americans from Iraqi legal action. Paul Pillar, the top U.S. intelligence official for the Near East from 2000 to 2005, said that because Trump had little foreign policy experience and had given conflicting accounts of what policies he would pursue, the Republican president-elect’s senior personnel appointments would be crucial. “What we’re seeing going on - and we should be worried about it - is a new president who on so many foreign policy issues has been all over the map,” said Pillar, now at Georgetown University. “Thus, the senior appointments game that we go through every four years has more consequences than it usually does.”   Bolton, who is under consideration as Trump’s secretary of state, the officials said, and Woolsey, reported to be in the running for U.S. director of national intelligence, did not respond to requests for comment. The Trump transition team also did not immediately respond when asked for comment.Even if Bolton is nominated, Senate confirmation is not a foregone conclusion. In 2005, Senate Democrats - with the support of a single Republican – blocked a vote to confirm him as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He was appointed to that post by Republican President George W. Bush while the Senate was in recess. Fleitz, in a brief phone conversation, confirmed he was involved in Trump’s transition effort, but declined further comment.  A return to power for the three officials would represent a change of fortune for them and other “neoconservatives” who provided the intellectual backing for the invasion of Iraq. During the presidential campaign, some leading neoconservatives and Republican foreign policy veterans opposed Trump, saying he was unfit to lead. The group saw its clout wane in Bush’s second term, as U.S. troops in Iraq found themselves mired in a sectarian civil war, and has watched from the sidelines during Democratic President Barack Obama’s eight years in power. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he opposed the invasion of Iraq, in which more than 4,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died, and which led to the creation of al Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner to the violent, ultra-hardline Islamic State group. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction and ties to al Qaeda, used to justify the invasion, proved to be nonexistent.  “As you know, for years I’ve been saying: ‘Don’t go into Iraq.’ They went into Iraq. They destabilized the Middle East. It was a big mistake,” Trump said in August 2015 on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program. His account that he always opposed the war was challenged during the campaign by Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who cited a 2002 interview Trump gave to radio host Howard Stern in which he replied: “Yeah I guess so” when asked if he supported invading Iraq. Consideration of Bolton, Woolsey and others is “another demonstration of how those who supported one of the biggest mistakes in American foreign policy have not been - they don’t seem to be sufficiently discredited to be removed from the Washington foreign policy dialogue,” Pillar said.

"Trump keeps saying that  bad people,  a.k.a radical Islamic terrorist groups, are happy that he s been unable to keep immigrants, refugees and travelers from seven Middle Eastern countries from coming into the U.S. But that s not what makes them happy. What makes them happy is actually that Trump is in the White House. He s a bumbling idiot who s going to piss off so many Muslims that these groups feel they won t have any trouble recruiting and growing, and throwing off the shackles of the  oppressive West. Al Qaeda s leader in Yemen has already expressed his sheer joy at Trump s bungled raid there. Hezbollah has joined the fray, too, saying something that should be offensive as all hell to Trump: We are very optimistic that when an idiot settles in the White House and boasts about his idiocy, this is the beginning of relief for the oppressed around the world. One of the reasons they feel optimistic is likely the fact that Trump is busy pissing off the entire world, which will galvanize various groups into working together assuming enough of the world gets angry.There are squillions of theories out about why these groups hate us so much, such as the anti-Muslim propaganda that s been circulating here with growing frequency over the last 15 years. Many people the world over view that kind of propaganda as coming from our government, and now, with Trump, that view has been vindicated.Trump is a master of anti-brown people propaganda to the point where terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS have used him in recruiting videos. He s said  Islam hates us,  and claimed we would  wipe out Islamic terrorist groups.  Four Islamic non-profit organizations have rejected federal funding intended to help them fight radicalization because of Trump. They feel that both the funds and Trump himself merely promote hatred, fear and intolerance, and that he s declared war on Muslims.There s much more, too. Trump is pigeonholing Muslims as a naturally violent group that must be exterminated. It alienates Muslims of every stripe. So really, is it any wonder that Hezbollah or anyone else is happy that Trump was elected? He s helping their cause. Trump is making things more dangerous for us. He will never do anything that will make us safer.Featured image by Chris Kleponis via Getty Images",0
"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has found faults with the central State Bank of Vietnam, including poor supervision of credit organizations and inefficiency in preventing corruption, the government said on Saturday. The announcement, which was published on the government s website, came amid an intensifying crackdown on corruption that has pushed many state executives and government officials into the spotlight. The Government Inspectorate found the bank slow and not complying with regulations when publicizing its properties and revenues, the report said, without elaborating.  Government officials have to reveal their incomes and properties to the public. Inspectors also pointed out violations by SBV s banking supervision agency, a department in charge of overseeing and examining credit organizations, from 2010 to 2015.   Credit organizations had several faults but during inspection, the supervising department did not promptly detect them to deal with and prevent them,  the government said. The inspectorate has called for the state bank governor to investigate groups and individuals behind the violations.  Vietnam s crackdown on corruption and mismanagement, with a focus on inefficient state-owned companies, earlier led to the rare dismissal of a member of the politburo and the sacking of a vice-minister. Four more officials from a scandal hit state-oil firm are being prosecuted over links to investment losses in a local bank. ",1

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives said they were willing to open formal talks on forming a government with Germany s Social Democrats (SPD) - but her chosen partner was expected to take two more days to decide how to proceed. Weakened by heavy election losses to the far-right and then by the collapse last month of talks on a three-way alliance, Merkel is pinning her hopes on the SPD for a fourth term as chancellor and to avoid new elections. Leaders of Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) and her Bavarian conservative allies (CSU) sought to persuade their SPD counterparts to drop their objections to a renewal of the  grand coalition  the two parties have been governing in since 2013.  The CDU and CSU representatives made clear that they wanted to begin exploratory talks with the SPD on creating a stable government,  the conservative camp said in a statement. But an SPD official said the party first needed to hold consultations before announcing a decision on Friday. After four years of governing with Merkel, the center-left party scored its worst election result since 1933 - and few members want to repeat that experience. Sensing that Merkel s lack of alternatives leaves it in a strong position, the SPD has said it would agree to share power only if it wins commitments on more generous social policy.  A decisive point for the SPD is that the social agenda has more prominence in Germany,  leading Social Democrat Carsten Schneider told German television ahead of the talks, demanding  fairness for ordinary heroes.  But the mood between the two parties is still sour and Merkel herself has been a frequent target of criticism by the Social Democrats. The secrecy surrounding the talks underlined their sensitivity. With both sides having a lot to lose, the parties plan no public statements when talks conclude on Wednesday evening. SPD leader Martin Schulz has made a pitch for EU integration leading to a  United States of Europe  by 2025, and the SPD wants a big spending boost on education, more nursery spots and a big healthcare reform. Merkel wants to maintain Germany s solid finances, cut some taxes and expand the digital infrastructure.  The SPD had vowed to go into opposition after its dismal election result and only softened its approach, agreeing to meet Merkel, due to pressure from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who wants to avoid new elections. The SPD pulled no punches in attacking Merkel during the election campaign. Schulz has described Merkel, known for pragmatism rather than vision, as a vacuum cleaner of ideas and has also accused her of silencing debate on issues.  A row last month over a conservative minister breaking protocol to back an extension for an EU license for a weed-killer despite SPD opposition hurt ties at a crucial time.    One of the SPD s deputies, Ralf Stegner, adopted a combative tone on Wednesday, saying nobody could dictate the terms to the SPD as the conservative bloc needed the party to rule.  Some in the SPD are prepared to contemplate another grand coalition, albeit with a clear SPD signature, but others prefer the idea of tolerating a minority government under Merkel.  One other option is a  KoKo  (cooperation coalition) agreement under which the SPD would agree to work with Merkel in some areas, such as the budget and European and foreign affairs, but force her to seek ad-hoc majorities for other policies. This idea is unpopular with conservatives who prefer a grand coalition.  We have to try it - but please, seriously,  Carsten Linnemann, head of a group representing small and medium-sized businesses in the conservative bloc, told ARD television. ",1

"Tonight s the night of the Golden Globe Awards, and comedian Jimmy Fallon was tapped to emcee the event. Before he even started his opening monologue, his teleprompter failed, so he ad libbed the whole thing. And he used the opportunity to take an awesome dig at Donald Trump for it.We all know by now that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million, but Trump still won thanks to the way the Electoral College works. Fallon touched on that when he said: This is the Golden Globes, one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote. Our manchild of a  leader  doesn t like things like this very much. Trump has been railing off and on about the popular vote controversy, despite the fact that his electoral votes secured his win, despite the fact that the electors still voted for him on Dec. 19, and despite the fact that Congress just certified that vote over the protests of several House Democrats and many Americans. He has been quiet of late about it, but he still seems to be smarting over his popular vote loss.Fallon didn t stop there, though. He also compared Trump to  Game of Thrones  King Joffrey, saying: [Game of Thrones] has so many plot twists and shocking moments, a lot of people are wondering what it would be like if King Joffery had lived. Well, in 12 days we re gonna find out,were carefully tabulated by the accounting firm Ernst and Young and Putin.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., will testify privately to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday as it investigates allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump Jr. had been invited to testify in public in a hearing in July, but reached an agreement to speak privately with committee staff. “We look forward to a professional and productive meeting and appreciate the opportunity to assist the committee,” Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr., said in a statement on Wednesday. Russia has loomed large over the first seven months of the Trump presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia worked to tilt last year’s presidential election in favor of Trump, the Republican candidate. Special counsel Robert Mueller is leading an investigation examining potential collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign. Several congressional committees are also looking into the matter, with the Senate and House intelligence committees conducting the main congressional investigations. Trump Jr. is expected to testify before Senate Intelligence sometime later this year. “I’m not interesting in talking to principal witnesses until I’ve talked to everybody else that was in the room,” Senator Richard Burr, the panel’s Republican chairman, told reporters. Congressional investigators have focused on a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower whose attendees included a Russian lawyer and lobbyist and Trump associates including his son, and what came out of it, if anything, in terms of the relationship between Russians and the Trump campaign or Trump business interests. Separately, Susan Rice, who was national security adviser for former President Barack Obama, testified on Tuesday before the House Intelligence Committee for about four hours. Erin Pelton, a spokeswoman for Rice, said she had met voluntarily with the committee as part of its investigation. “Ambassador Rice remains fully supportive of bipartisan efforts to determine the extent and scope of Russia’s outrageous efforts to interfere in the 2016 election,” she said in a statement. Rice had been subpoenaed by the committee as it looked into Republican concerns about whether anyone from the administration of Obama, a Democrat, had asked to “unmask” names of Trump campaign advisers picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts. Several U.S. officials have told Reuters that all such requests by Obama administration officials were properly scrutinized and appropriate. Moscow has denied any meddling. Trump denies collusion by his campaign. ",1

"AACHEN, Germany (Reuters) - Social Democrat Martin Schulz on Saturday read out a message he received via Facebook from a young Syrian migrant who called on Germans to exercise their right to vote in Sunday s national election. In an open letter to the German people, Abdul Abbasi, a translator at a migrant legal clinic in Goettingen, talked of watching friends killed before his eyes while participating in pro-democracy demonstrations in Syria in 2012, Schulz said.  Their goals and desires were things that are considered normal in Germany in 2017. They died because they wanted to live as free people ... they wanted the right to participate in the politics of their country,  Abbasi wrote.  The ability to vote and live in a democratic country is a dream of many in this world,  he said.  Go vote and protect your democracy, protect us from people who divide us into categories, fight against our ability to live together and want to divide the society.  Abbasi was not immediately available to comment. His Facebook profile said he was from Aleppo, Syria, and was studying dentistry at the University of Goettingen. Schulz said the letter underscored the importance of voting at a time when the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is poised to become the first far-right party in the Bundestag since the end of World War Two. Abbasi posted the open letter in response to a Facebook posting in which Schulz called the AfD  a danger to our democracy  and said it  has no business being in parliament . Founded in 2013 to oppose large bailouts of financially strapped euro zone countries, the AfD has gained popular support after Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015 opened the doors to about a million migrants. It is now polling around 13 percent.  What a wonderful letter, and what a challenge for us,  Schulz told thousands of supporters gathered for his final campaign appearance. With support of around 21 percent, the SPD is running far behind Merkel s conservatives in the polls, which are at 34 percent. Electoral arithmetic might yet force Merkel to renew her coalition with the SPD, or she might opt for a three-way alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmental Greens. ",1
"DUBAI (Reuters) - A Bahrain court sentenced three family members of a prominent activist to jail terms on weapons charges on Monday, rights group the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said and accused authorities of using torture to extract confessions. In a separate case, Bahrain s Public Prosecutor announced on Monday that it had sentenced 19 unnamed defendants to prison terms for contacts with a banned party it says is backed by Iran and involved in militant attacks. The cases underscore how authorities in the kingdom is cracking down on perceived threats nearly six years after pro-democracy protests inspired by the  Arab Spring  were quashed with help from Gulf Arab neighbors. Bahrain hosts the U.S. Fifth Fleet. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD s head of advocacy, said his relatives were convicted based on confessions gained by torture and said the court was persecuting the family for his activism. Alwadaei s mother-in-law Hajer Mansoor and brother-in-law Sayed Nizar Alwadaei were each sentenced to three years in jail for planting a  fake bomb,  BIRD said, while his cousin Mahmood Marzooq was sentenced to a month and half for obtaining a knife. Representatives of the Bahraini government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Alwadaei, who is based in Britain, said he believed the case against his relatives was motivated by his human rights work and especially a protest last year in which he took part against the attendance of Bahrain s king at a royal horse show in Britain.  I was distraught to see my family suffer torture, persecution and interrogations about my activities ... I will not rest until they are freed,  Alwadaei said in a statement. Bahrain, which has a Shi ite Muslim majority population and is ruled by a Sunni royal family, denies clamping down on dissent. The government, citing years of deadly bombing and shooting attacks against its security forces, says it faces a militant threat backed by arch-foe Iran. According to the prosecutor, a court sentenced eight defendants to life terms, nine to 15 years and two for ten years for  conspiring with a foreign state and terrorist organisation working for its interests and receiving funds from it to carry out hostile acts and in order to harm national interests.  Fifteen of the defendants had their citizenship revoked. The group it cited was the Islamic Wafa Movement, a political party that is banned in Bahrain and which authorities accuse of receiving money and support from Iran. A leader in Wafa, Murtada al-Sanadi, an exiled Bahraini cleric who was named by the United States this year as a  specially designated global terrorist  and appears to be based in the Iranian city of Qom.

"(Reuters) - Kansas Governor Sam Brownback on Thursday shrugged off the political backlash and budget woes stirred by his aggressive tax-cutting policies at home as he looked forward to a new role as the Trump administration’s chief defender of global religious tolerance. The two-term Republican addressed both topics at a news conference in Topeka a day after the White House announced that he would soon be nominated as U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom, a State Department post. Brownback, who previously represented his home state in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, was a sponsor of the 1998 law that created the diplomatic post he now aspires to fill. “International religious freedom is going the wrong way. It’s getting worse around the world, not better,” Brownback told reporters. “It affects all faiths, it affects all religions.” One of Brownback’s most notable forays into the realm of faith as governor came in 2015, when he issued an executive order to protect the religious convictions of clergy as Kansas began to comply with the landmark ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage. His gubernatorial legacy, however, has been largely defined by 2012 legislation he championed to roll back tax rates to help stimulate Kansas’ economy. The deep cuts shrank state coffers and caused Kansas to miss revenue targets, turning the state into a cautionary tale of fiscal mismanagement.  “It’s amazed me, too, that a tax cut done in a Midwestern state in 2012 has been the dominant tax discussion in America the last five years,” Brownback said on Thursday. He mostly defended his tax strategy, though conceded some resulting spending cuts could have been carried out “more artfully.”  More than a dozen conservative allies in the state legislature lost their seats in the November election in what was seen as a political repudiation of Brownback’s fiscal policies. Earlier this year, both chambers of the Republican-controlled legislature voted to raise taxes and overrode Brownback’s attempt to veto that measure. Republican state Representative Melissa Rooker, in a separate interview with Reuters, called Brownback’s tax policy “an unmitigated disaster.” Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer, a physician who previously served in the legislature, would succeed Brownback if he resigned to assume the diplomatic post. It was unclear how soon Brownback might move to Washington, D.C. In the meantime, his standing at home is low. Brownback ranks as the second-least popular governor in the United States, with a 66 percent disapproval rating, according to the nonpartisan political research company Morning Consult. ",1
"BEIRUT/RIYADH/AMMAN (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia pulled no punches when it condemned President Donald Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But Palestinian officials say Riyadh has also been working for weeks behind the scenes to press them to support a nascent U.S. peace plan. Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Wednesday with his announcement and instructions to begin the process of moving the embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, despite warnings that it would drive the wedge between Israel and the Palestinians deeper.  The Saudi royal court described the decision as  unjustified and irresponsible  and  a big step back in efforts to advance the peace process.  But Arab officials privately say that Riyadh appears to be on board with a broader U.S. strategy for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan still in its early phases of development. Four Palestinian officials, who spoke on condition they not be named, said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas discussed in detail a grand bargain that Trump and Jared Kushner, the president s son-in-law and adviser, are expected to unveil in the first half of 2018. One official said Prince Mohammed asked Abbas to show support for the U.S. administration s peace efforts when the two met in Riyadh in November.  Another Palestinian official said Prince Mohammed told Abbas:  Be patient, you will hear good news. This peace process will go ahead.  The U.S.-Saudi relationship has improved dramatically under Trump, partly because the leaders share a vision of confronting Riyadh s arch-rival Iran more aggressively in the region.  Kushner, 36, whose father knew Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, has also nurtured strong personal ties with the 32-year-old crown prince as he asserts Saudi influence internationally and amasses power for himself at home. The Saudi royal court did not respond to requests for comment. A White House official said Kushner did not ask the crown prince to talk to Abbas about the plan. Palestinian officials fear, and many Arab officials suspect, that by closing the door on East Jerusalem as the future capital of a Palestinian state, Trump will align with Israel in offering the Palestinians limited self-government inside disconnected patches of the occupied West Bank, with no right of return for refugees displaced by the Arab-Israeli wars of 1948 and 1967. The Palestinian officials said they were concerned that the proposal that Prince Mohammed communicated to Abbas, which purportedly came from Kushner, presents exactly that scenario. As told to Abbas, the proposal included establishing  a Palestinian entity  in Gaza as well as the West Bank administrative areas A and B and 10 percent of area C, which contains Jewish settlements, a third Palestinian official said.  Jewish settlements in the West Bank would stay, there would be no right of return, and Israel would remain responsible for the borders, he said. The proposal appears to differ little from existing arrangements in the West Bank, widening Palestinian control but falling far short of their minimum national demands.  This is rejected by Palestinians. Abu Mazen (Abbas) explained the position and its danger to the Palestinian cause and Saudi Arabia understood that,  the official said. The White House official denied that Kushner communicated those details to Prince Mohammed:  It does not accurately reflect any part of the conversation.  Trump sought to temper the blow from his Jerusalem announcement with a phone call to Abbas on Tuesday, stressing that the Palestinians stood to gain from the plan being drawn up by Kushner and U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt.  President Trump in a phone call told Abu Mazen:  I will have some proposals for you that you would like . When Abu Mazen pressed him on details, Trump didn t give any,  the first Palestinian official said. A Saudi source said he believed an understanding on Israeli-Palestinian peace would nonetheless begin to emerge in the coming weeks.  Do not underestimate the businessman in (Trump). He has always called it the ultimate deal,  the source said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject.  I don t think our government is going to accept that unless it has something sweetened in the pipeline which (King Salman and the crown prince) could sell to the Arab world   that the Palestinians would have their own state.   Trump s decision on Jerusalem is seen almost uniformly in Arab capitals as a sharp tilt toward Israel, which has only signed peace deals with Egypt and Jordan.  Jordan, a U.S. ally which has played a key role in the peace process since inking its bilateral deal with Israel in 1994, insists that no peace can be achieved without Jerusalem. Jordanian political analyst Oraib Rantawi, who spoke with King Abdullah after the monarch met with top U.S. administration officials last week, said Amman is worried about being bypassed in favor of Saudi Arabia.  There are direct dealings and a desire to present a deal that is unfair to the Palestinians in return for securing U.S. backing and paving the way for Gulf-Israeli cooperation to confront Iran,  he said. Most Arab states are unlikely to object to Trump s announcement because they find themselves more aligned with Israel than ever, particularly on countering Iran, said Shadi Hamid, senior fellow at Brookings Institution in Washington,   If Saudi officials, including the crown prince himself, were particularly concerned with Jerusalem s status, they would presumably have used their privileged status as a top Trump ally and lobbied the administration to hold off on such a needlessly toxic move,  he wrote in an article published in The Atlantic.  It s unlikely Trump would have followed through if the Saudis had drawn something resembling a red line.              Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, a member of the security cabinet, told Army Radio in November that Israel has had covert contacts with Saudi Arabia, a disclosure of long-rumored secret dealings between the two countries which have no official ties. Saudi Arabia denied the reports. It maintains that normalizing relations hinges on Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war, territory Palestinians seek for a future state. But with both Saudi Arabia and Israel viewing Iran as a major main threat in the Middle East, shared interests may push them to work together. Under Prince Mohammed, the kingdom is pushing back at what it sees as growing Iranian influence in and around its borders.   They ve got an unprecedented level of support from Washington right now and seem to be making the most of it,  said a diplomat in the region.  They re not willing to jeopardize that. They ve got bigger fish to fry.  ",1
"RUSH LIMBAUGH GOT IT WRONG EARLIER TODAY BUT MAKES A GREAT POINT ABOUT THE WASHINGTON ELITES:Conservative radio great Rush Limbaugh announced to his audience Tuesday that he s been told that  George W. Bush and Laura Bush voted for Hillary Clinton today,  the Washington Examiner reports. On one level, it s personal. Remember what Trump said about Jeb. And Trump has had some unkind things to say about George W. Bush,  Limbaugh explained, referencing Donald Trump s habit during the Republican primary of calling Jeb Bush  low energy. But aside from that, think about party loyalty, think about issues, think about the direction of the country,  Limbaugh added.  How does anybody vote for Hillary Clinton? Limbaugh issued a stern warning to the  elites in Washington and New York,  members of the  club  of powerful, self-interested political and media figures. I submit to you that if you re in the club, and by the club I mean the establishment, if you are among the few elites in Washington and New York that actually, for lack of a better term, run the country, you re going to hang together with other club members,  Limbaugh said.  That s how I think this happens. Hillary Clinton s not seen as a Democrat  She may be, on one intramural level, an opponent, but she s certainly not an enemy when somebody outside the club happens to be running,  Limbaugh continued.  Members of the club   they re going to hang together to preserve the existence of the club and its exclusivity. Via: Breitbart ",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team can now begin work with officials at certain government agencies as they prepare for the new administration to take over in January, the White House said on Thursday.  “The President-elect’s team has now completed the necessary steps for an initial group of authorized individuals to begin receiving briefings and other materials from our transition teams at select agencies across the government,” said White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine in a statement. “We expect to receive additional names for a wider range of agencies from the President-elect’s team as the transition work continues, and we will facilitate those requests on a rolling basis,” Hoffine said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. government watchdog has agreed to review how classified information is kept secure at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, the agency said on Monday, after Democratic lawmakers raised concerns about the issue last month. The Government Accountability Office’s review will examine whether Secret Service agents subject Mar-a-Lago guests to any security screening, and evaluate the expenses incurred by government employees who travel with Trump to Mar-a-Lago, according to a letter the agency sent the lawmakers on Friday. The GAO will also check whether Trump has made any payments to the U.S. Treasury from profits at his hotels, the letter said. Trump’s lawyer pledged at a Jan. 11 news conference to donate Trump Hotel profits from foreign governments to the Treasury.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump’s handling of U.S. security information at Mar-a-Lago came under congressional scrutiny in February after photos taken by private guests in the club’s public dining area showed Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reviewing documents following a North Korean missile launch. The White House denied afterward that any classified material was present in the dining room. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said on Monday the GAO would be able to conduct an “independent review” of how Trump spends his weekends at the resort, which the Republican president has dubbed his “Winter White House.” In a Feb. 16 letter, Cummings and Democratic Senators Tom  Udall, Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse asked the GAO to assess whether Trump and his staff had violated security protocol when hosting foreign dignitaries and handling classified information at the Florida resort.  Udall said on Monday the American people “deserved to know who has access to the president, how much it’s costing to protect him and whether the Trump Organization is benefiting from that protection.” He introduced a bill on Friday that would require the White House to publish logs of people who meet with Trump there and at other locations.     The GAO is expected to begin the review in a few months. ",1
"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s ruling party lawmakers gave preliminary approval on Friday to two bills allowing parliament and the president to replace top judges, plans the opposition and the European Commission denounced as a threat to the rule of law. Once finally approved and signed into law by the president, the bills would likely deepen the right-wing government s standoff with the EU, potentially reducing the flow of EU development funds to Poland. Law and Justice (PiS) party deputies sent the bills authored by PiS-ally President Andrzej Duda to parliamentary committees after Duda vetoed in July PiS-sponsored bills that would have given the justice minister large powers over judges. Duda cast his veto after prolonged mass protests across Poland in July. Several thousand people in more than 100 cities protested the bills again on Friday night, although the demonstrations fell short of the mass summer rallies.  I do not suppose that something will change in the way the authorities act, because these authorities are not listening to the people,  said 29-year-old Jakub, a company worker who did not want to give his last name.  But we are here to show that we will not agree to everything, we will not agree to laws, which lead to us leaving the European Union.  In November, Duda and PiS reached an agreement on the shape of the judicial reform, according to which parliament will need a three-fifths majority to appoint new members of the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), a key panel that appoints judges in Poland.  Details of the judicial reform bills are expected to be revealed on Tuesday and PiS has said all work on them could be finished in December.  The PiS currently has an absolute parliamentary majority, but not a three-fifths one.  The euroskeptic PiS says reform of the judicial system is needed because the courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist-era mentality.  But critics of the government said the bills are part of a PiS plan to increase its powers over the judiciary and reflect its drive towards authoritarianism, both charges PiS denies.  Will this demolition speed up court cases? No,  lawmaker Krzysztof Paszyk of the opposition PSL told parliament on Friday, adding the bills would introduces  pathology  into the justice system. The European Commission s deputy head, Frans Timmermans, said earlier in November that Duda s bills - which row back from direct government interference in the judiciary envisaged in the original PiS bills - were still not acceptable. The socially conservative PiS, in power since late 2015, is already at loggerheads with fellow members of the European Union over migration policy, its push to bring state media under more direct government control, as well as over an earlier overhaul of the Constitutional Tribunal. Also on Friday, PiS deputies initially approved a bill amending the electoral system, which the opposition said would threaten the fairness of elections. ",1

"ISE-SHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Thursday he expects the Taliban to continue a strategy of violence following the appointment of a hardline leader, adding that the United States aims to uphold Afghanistan’s fragile democratization and prevent its use as a base by Islamic State.   “This continues to be an organization that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in Afghanistan,” said Obama, told reporters during a Group of Seven summit at Ise-Shima in central Japan. “In the short-term, we anticipate that the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and blowing up innocent people.”  “Our goal right now is to make sure (Afghanistan’s) constitution and democratic process is upheld (and) maintain the counter-terrorism platforms that we need in the region so that al Qaeda and now ISIL are not able to take root and use it as a base to attack us in the United States,” he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. The selection of cleric Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada as the new Taliban chief on Wednesday all but dashes Obama’s hopes for opening peace talks before he leaves office, one of his top foreign policy goals, current and former U.S. defense and intelligence officials said. Akhundzada, a conservative Islamic scholar from the Taliban’s stronghold in southern Afghanistan, succeeded Mullah Akhtar Mansour four days after he was killed in a U.S. drone strike.  Some U.S. officials had expressed hope that Mansour’s death would eliminate an obstacle to peace negotiations between the Taliban and the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. ",1
"Colin Powell is a Republican, but he voted for our beloved President Obama twice, and now he is again angering the nutty wing of his party by refusing to stand by the disgraceful 2016 GOP nominee that is Donald Trump. He s gone even further than that, though, and has endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Now, considering Powell s voting habits of the last eight years, one could argue that he is just a RINO at this point (Republican In Name Only). But, we must remember   he was Secretary of State under President George W. Bush. You don t get much more traditionally Republican than that. On the other hand, he is a smart, reasonable human being who loves his country and has served it proudly in a prestigious and celebrated military career, rising all the way up the ranks to become a General in the United States Army.Powell s revelation comes after leaked emails revealed that he views Donald Trump as a  national disgrace.  To that end, one would expect that General Powell would want nothing to do with today s version of the party he has been a proud member of for so long.This is the biggest blow yet to Donald Trump and the GOP writ large, considering how respected Colin Powell is in this great nation, regardless of party affiliations or political leanings. This is especially powerful considering that we are now exactly two weeks from Election Day. This is a great sign that Americans will do the right thing, and to reject the bigotry, misogyny, and demagoguery that is Donald Trump.As for the Republican-elected officials that continue to stand behind Trump   shame on you.

"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Armed insurgents stopped and torched a Bangkok-bound passenger bus on a highway in southern Thailand on Sunday, police said. All 14 passengers, as well as the bus driver and his assistance, survived the attack, although their luggage were burned with the bus. The attack occurred in Yala, one of the predominantly ethnic Malay Muslim provinces in the south where a separatist insurgency has dragged on for more than a decade. More than 6,500 people have been killed since 2004. Police said at least 10 gunmen were involved in the latest attack. They all escaped, blocking the road with tree trunks and nails to thwart any pursuers. An army spokesman was not available for comment. As with most violence in Thailand s deep south, there was no claim of responsibility. The insurgents are fighting for secession from predominantly Buddhist Thailand. Thailand s military government has, since 2015, held talks brokered by Malaysia, aim at ending the violence. The process, which aim to established a  safety-zone  as a confidence-building measure by early next year, has been stalled. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mayors of 21 cities in Florida on Friday called on the moderators of next week’s presidential debates in Miami to ask candidates how they would deal with rising sea levels caused by climate change, a concern of the state’s coastal communities. “It would be unconscionable for these issues of grave concern for the people of Florida to not be addressed in the upcoming debate you will be hosting in the state,” the mayors wrote in an letter to CNN, The Washington Post, Univision and the other media outlets hosting the Democratic and Republican debates on March 9 and March 10 in Miami.  The bipartisan group of mayors, who represent coastal cities and towns from Miami to Tampa, have complained that the issue of climate change has not been raised in the dozens of televised debates held to date. Of the four remaining Republican candidates, none say they believe that anything should be done to address climate change and all have called for federal environmental rules to be scaled back. One of the letter’s signatories, Pinecrest Mayor Cindy Lerner, traveled to New Hampshire in February to press Florida Republican candidate Senator Marco Rubio to discuss the issue. Rubio has said that the climate has always been changing and that he will not support policies to combat climate change that will “destroy our economy.” Billionaire businessman Donald Trump has called climate change a conspiracy invented by China, while Texas Senator Ted Cruz called climate science “pseudoscientific theory.” Ohio Governor John Kasich has said climate change is a problem but has not proposed a plan to address it. Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders have made climate change a top-tier issue that needs to be addressed. Southeast Florida is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels. Four counties in the region formed the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact six years ago to coordinate their response and pool funding to deal with its impact. The issue has gotten little attention in the national presidential debates.   The mayors provided debate moderators three questions on climate change, all of which were directed to Rubio. They warned that higher sea levels will pose a costly threat to Florida’s economy. Florida coastal communities could experience about a 2-foot (60-cm) rise in sea level by 2060, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigating whether Russia tried to sway the 2016 U.S. election has taken over FBI inquiries into a former British spy’s dossier of allegations of Russian financial and personal links to President Donald Trump’s campaign and associates, sources familiar with the inquiry told Reuters. A report compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele identified Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the Russian government. A spokesman for special counsel Robert Mueller declined comment. The FBI also declined comment. Three sources with knowledge of Mueller’s probe said his investigators have assumed control of multiple inquiries into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump, a Republican. Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election. Two officials familiar with the investigations said that both Mueller’s team and the Senate Intelligence Committee are seeking any evidence that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort or others who had financial dealings with Russia might have helped Kremlin intelligence agencies target email hacking and social media postings undermining Trump’s election opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday, the Senate panel’s chairman Richard Burr told reporters that the issue of whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia remains an open question. “We have not come to any determination on collusion,” Burr said. Trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax, has faced questions about the matter since he took office in January.     Trump was told by former FBI director James Comey that Steele’s report contained salacious material about the businessman-turned-president. Burr said on Wednesday that the Senate panel had made several attempts to contact Steele and to meet him and “those offers have gone unaccepted.” “The committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub-sources,” Burr said.  Burr said the panel wanted to finish its investigation by the end of the year. Although several news organizations, including Reuters, were briefed on Steele’s dossier before the election in November, most decided not to report on the material because its inflammatory and sometimes salacious content could not be verified. In a report published in January four U.S. intelligence agencies said they took the dossier’s allegations seriously. Separately, three Russian businessmen, Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan have sued Washington investigations firm Fusion GPS and its founder, Glenn Simpson, with allegations that they were libeled in Steele’s dossier. A spokeswoman for Simpson and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the lawsuit filed on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington. The lawsuit said that Steele’s reports were “gravely damaging” to the businessmen because they accused them “of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with the ‘Kremlin’ to influence the 2016 presidential election.”  The information on Trump collected by Steele, whom officials say was one of MI6’s most respected Russia hands, was laid out last year in political “opposition research” initially financed by supporters of one of Trump’s Republican primary election opponents. After Trump won the Republican nomination in July, backers of Clinton picked up the support of Steele’s work. The lawsuit said the dossier’s allegations are false in implying an improper “ongoing” relationship between the businessmen, the Alfa Group financial company in which they were investors and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that a Russian government official acted as middleman in such contacts.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - The humanitarian situation in the besieged eastern suburbs of Damascus is  an outrage  and parties to the conflict must allow food and medicine to reach at least 350,000 trapped Syrians, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein said on Friday.  The shocking images of what appear to be severely malnourished children that have emerged in recent days are a frightening indication of the plight of people in Eastern Ghouta, who are now facing a humanitarian emergency,  Zeid said in a statement. The tightening siege has pushed people to the verge of famine in the rebel enclave, residents and aid workers have told Reuters.  I remind all parties that the deliberate starvation of civilians as a method of warfare constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law, and may amount to a crime against humanity and/or a war crime,  Zeid said. Zeid s office had a list of several hundred people who needed medical evacuation, but the government had reportedly imposed severe restrictions on such evacuations, leading to the deaths of several civilians, the U.N. statement said.  A U.N. convoy last reached the besieged area on Sept 23, with aid for 25,000 people. Food prices have rocketed since forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad took control of several neighborhoods in May and destroyed tunnels that had been used to smuggle goods into the siege. This month they closed Eastern Ghouta s main access checkpoint and imposed a big rise in taxes imposed on traders. Last week two food warehouses were looted in  a possible sign of growing desperation , the U.N. statement said. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A company promoting a plan for the United States and Russia to jointly build nuclear reactors in the Middle East denied in a letter made public on Monday that its director received an Inauguration Day text message from incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn saying the project was “good to go.” Citing a confidential informant, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives’ Oversight and Government Reform Committee last week said Flynn and Alex Copson, managing director of ACU Strategic Partners, communicated during President Donald Trump’s inaugural address about the project, which would have required lifting U.S. sanctions on Moscow. Thomas Cochran, a business partner of Copson, wrote in a letter to the lawmaker, Representative Elijah Cummings, that the informant’s allegations are “patently false and unfounded.” Reuters was unable to identify the confidential informant or independently confirm the informant’s information that was provided by Cummings.  Copson has not responded to numerous requests for comment in recent months. Cochran attached to the letter records for Copson’s cell phone which, he said, show that he exchanged three text messages on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, none of them with Flynn. “Since Mr. Copson did not receive a text message from General Flynn during the Inauguration, other allegations of the ‘whistleblower’ are equally false and unfounded,” wrote Cochran, who is ACU Strategic Partners’ senior scientist. Flynn is a retired Army general. Reuters and other news organizations have reported that Flynn continued to promote a version of the nuclear project after he began work at the White House. As part of his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, special counsel Robert Mueller is looking at whether Flynn or other Trump aides tried to influence U.S. policy to improve relations with Russia.   Proponents of the reactors project argued it would provide nuclear energy in the Middle East without the threat of weapons proliferation, improve U.S.-Russia relations and revive the U.S. nuclear industry. Flynn served just 24 days as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for misleading Vice President Michael Pence about whether he discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to Washington.  He pleaded guilty on Dec. 1 to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Reuters reported that day that documents it had reviewed showed that ACU Strategic Partners bragged after Trump’s Nov. 8, 2016, election that it had Flynn’s backing.  Cummings wrote back to Copson on Monday, requesting that he participate in a transcribed interview “so that our staff attorneys could ask you questions about your relationship and communications with General Flynn.” “It remains unclear why your colleague sent this letter rather than you,” he wrote. Cummings’ office released Cochran’s letter but not the attached phone records.  ",1
" In a speech at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida on Tuesday, President Obama declared that  [n]o foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland.  The claim earned perfunctory applause, but a closer look at the reaction of many of the servicemen and women there made clear what they really thought about the administration s handling of national security.Obama speaks to our troops at MacDill Air Force Base about foreign terror attacks on our homeland:The President s claim  which he has repeated in some form or fashion over the last few years  is an obvious rhetorical attempt to gloss over the reality of the threat of radical Islamic terror on American soil. The attempt to disconnect lone wolf  terrorists from the terror organizations who often inspire them does nothing to alleviate the pain of those who have suffered at the hands of jihadists and only hurts prevention efforts. Rhetorical tricks aside, the reality is that during Obama s tenure scores of innocent Americans have been murdered on U.S. soil by jihadists, most of whom were inspired by or acting under the direction of foreign terror groups, particularly the Islamic state.Below is a list of the major, verifiable radical Islamic terror attacks  successfully planned and executed  on U.S. soil since Obama first took office in 2009 (the first section provided by Daily Wire s Aaron Bandler): Little Rock, Arkansas, June 1, 2009. Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad shot and murdered one soldier, Army Pvt. William Andrew Long, and injured another, Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, at a military recruiting station in Little Rock. Muhammad reportedly converted to Islam in college and was on the FBI s radar after being arrested in Yemen a hotbed of radical Islamic terrorism for using a Somali passport, even though he was a U.S. citizen. In a note to an Arkansas judge, Muhammad claimed to be a member of al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, the terror group s Yemen chapter.Fort Hood, Texas, November 5, 2009.

Hasan was in contact with al-Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki prior to the attack and shouted Allahu Akbar! as he fired upon the soldiers on the Fort Hood base. After being sentenced to death, Hasan requested to join ISIS while on death row. It took six years for Obama to acknowledge the shooting as a terror attack instead of  workplace violence.

"When asked by the other hosts on the show,  Where would you go?  Whoopie pauses, then realizes there really is no better country on the earth, as she sheepishly replies,  I don t know, I ve always been in America.  There s usually a good reason that people don t give up their citizenship Whoopie. There s probably a reason so many people are willing to break the law and illegally enter our country. Despite the drivel you and your cohorts push on  The View,  every American doesn t believe they re somehow a victim, and most Americans agree with Trump that we shouldn t be willing to give up all that makes America great just because the Left wants to shore up their voting block. If you wanna know what is really getting under Whoopie s skin, it s the idea that no one in the media can control Trump. That s what s really got the girls on  The View  freaking out Wednesday on ABC s  The View,  co-host Whoopi Goldberg said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump needs to  stop blaming  others for the problems in America and threatened to  move  out of the country.https://youtu.be/NwE2ZvcpKUsGoldberg said,  People don t like being the butt of the jokes and now that people say, listen, you can t make me the butt of your jokes, I don t like it. You can t use me as some sort of stereotype. I don t like it. That s the PC people are talking about. And the bottom line is this find a different way to say what you re going to say. People are not going to take it anymore. So if that s what s pisses you off, you re going to stay angry. Co-host Joy Behar said,  A lot of it has to do with their pocketbook. They re not making as much money as they used to make, that particular group of people. Maybe jobs are overseas, maybe technology has taken over, they don t have the background for it. They re ticked off. Goldberg interjected,  But then you can t blame immigrants for that. Behar continued,  That s scapegoating. It s as old as the hills. What do you think World War II is all about? You know that. It s all about blaming the Jews. Now it s the Mexicans and the Muslims. Blame everybody but yourself. Later in the segment, Goldberg continued her rant. Listen, he can be whatever party he wants to be,  she said.  What he can t be is he can t be the guy that says it s your fault stuff isn t working. That s not the president I want. Find a way to make stuff work. Stop blaming everybody because all of this, as American citizens, this is our   we did all of this. We ve allowed all this stuff, so we have to fix it. But you can t say,  Oh, you re Lebanese or you re black or you re Mexican or you re a woman.  Stop blaming everybody. Let s fix the crap. Let s just fix it. If you can fix it, I will listen to what you have to say. The minute you start pointing and saying that person is a rapist and a murderer, it pisses me off because I ve been part of that when they just use a blanket statement to talk about black people or when they use a blanket statement to talk about white people or women or any other group. I don t think that s America. I don t want it to be America. Maybe it s time for me to move, you know. I can afford to go,  she added.  I ve always been an American, and this has always been my country and we ve always been able to have discussions. And suddenly now it s turning into, you know, not them, not them. And you know, we have a lot of friends whose parents saw this already. They don t want to relive this   So I need all the candidates to get it together. Get back to American values. Behar said,  I must be naive maybe but I do believe that at the end of the day the American people will not vote for that type of xenophobia. The fact that they voted twice for President Obama, twice for President Clinton, people like that. I really do believe they will come to their senses. You know what, he can t win without 40 percent of the Hispanic vote and he has alienated the Hispanics. Via: Breitbart News",0

"Another hypocritical  Christian  politician gets caught sexually abusing a child and has the gall to blame the victim instead of taking personal responsibility.Former Hubbard, Ohio mayor Richard Keenan faces a lengthy prison sentence after being indicted on eight counts of rape and 12 counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition last month.In 2010, Keenan bragged about his so-called  Christian  values upon becoming the new mayor.  I m a Christian,  Keenan told the Youngstown Vindicator at the time.  Dedicating my life to Jesus has changed my life. Don t preach it, but live it. Over the course of three years, Keenan repeatedly sexually abused a little girl from when she was 4-years-old until she turned 7.Keenan admitted to the crimes after the girl told his wife, who is a pastor, about the abuse.The 65-year-old Keenan also admitted to what he had done to other relatives in a group session at a hospital.He also told a social worker at a psychiatric facility about raping the girl, saying that the abuse began in 2013 but then blamed the little girl for his actions, calling her a  willing participant  who somehow consented to being raped by him.For some reason, Keenan was allowed to go free on $75,000 bond and won t stand trial until April of next year.If convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison.This is yet another example of a supposed  Christian  committing a heinous crime and being a complete hypocrite.At least in this case the pastor did the right thing by reporting her rapist husband to authorities instead of trying to cover it up like a church in Ohio did earlier this year when a youth pastor raped a teen girl repeatedly. Columbia Road Baptist Church could have prevented the sexual abuse had they fired and reported the pastor for obsessively sending text messages to the girl. But they basically looked the other way and gave the pastor the opening to take his obsession with the teen girl to a sick new level and then disgustingly blamed the victim and demanded that the girl apologize to the pastor s wife.And conservative  Christians  wonder why people are abandoning religion. THIS is why.Featured image via Wikimedia",0
"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A failed Republican effort to replace Obamacare raised new concerns on Tuesday for U.S. health insurers over whether the government will continue to fund billions of dollars in medical benefit subsidies. The healthcare bill under consideration in the U.S. Senate would have settled the funding question, but was scrapped after Republican leaders were unable to rally enough party members to win approval.   Its demise will test the ability of Republicans and Democrats to stabilize an insurance market serving some 10 million Americans in time for 2018.  Republican President Donald Trump has suggested several times that he could eliminate the so-called cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which help pay for consumers’ out-of-pocket healthcare expenses.  The administration could do so as early as August. Insurers have braced for an end to these payments, in many cases raising proposed premium prices for 2018 more than 20 percent to make up for the lost funding. Insurers said on Tuesday they would like Congress to appropriate the funds for these payments. If that does not happen, and the Trump administration takes further measures to undermine Democratic former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, more insurers may pull out of markets for next year ahead of a late September deadline.  That could force consumers to change plans or insurers - or leave them with no options at all. “Our members and all Americans need the certainty and security of knowing coverage will be available and affordable for them,” said Justine Handelman, senior vice president in the Office of Policy and Representation at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents insurers nationwide.  “We have consistently urged that there be immediate, certain funding for the cost-sharing reduction program, which helps those most in need with out-of-pocket costs when they access medical care.” Molina Healthcare Inc (MOH.N), which provides Obamacare health plans to more than 1 million people, said the fate of cost-sharing subsidies is one of its top concerns. The Trump administration could take other steps on its own to undermine Obamacare, including refusing to enforce the individual mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine.      Trump has repeatedly said Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, is collapsing, and on Tuesday suggested letting it “fail” to force Democrats to work on a healthcare fix. Earlier this year, the administration backed off more strictly enforcing the individual mandate and pulled ads that encouraged people to sign up for health insurance. Uncertainty over the government’s next steps on Obamacare weighed on insurer shares on Tuesday, with Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) down 1.4 percent and Aetna Inc (AET.N) off 1.1 percent. UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N), which pulled out of the Obamacare individual insurance business, rose 0.3 percent after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote in the coming days on a full repeal of Obamacare with no replacement, but he did not appear to have the necessary support to push it through. Some Republicans and Democrats say they should attempt a joint fix, but the deep divisions between the two parties were on display over the subsidies on Tuesday. Democratic Senator Patty Murray said that bipartisan work can begin by having Congress fund the cost-sharing subsidies. “We know that’s what needs to be done,” she said in an interview. “It would send a very strong message to the market.” Several Republican senators were quick to deride the payments. “Those who will be interested in moving an insurance bailout later this year should be ready to explain how they want to pay for it,” said Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s security forces killed 10 suspected militants on Sunday in a shootout during a raid on two apartments in central Cairo, the Interior Ministry said. Nine policemen, including four officers, were injured during the two raids, it said in a statement. An insurgency led by Islamic State in Egypt s rugged Sinai peninsula has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen since the Egyptian military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013, but attacks have increasingly moved to the mainland in recent months. Authorities received information about militants fleeing North Sinai to hideouts in Cairo, where they were preparing to carry out attacks on more centrally located provinces, the ministry statement said.  The police suffered their injuries after a suspected militant detonated an explosive device to block them from entering the building and during an exchange of fire that followed, security sources said.    One of the security sources said authorities suspect the individuals to be members of Hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the Egyptian capital targeting judges and policemen since last year. Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this.  ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Thursday launched an effort to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign supplies of critical minerals used in smartphones, computers and military equipment, which he said poses a national security and economic risk. Under a directive from President Donald Trump, Zinke will  work with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to publish in 60 days a list of non-fuel minerals that are vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and necessary for manufacturing and will develop a strategy to lessen U.S. dependence on foreign suppliers. The policy would aim to identify new domestic sources of critical minerals; increase domestic exploration, mining and  recycling; giving miners and producers electronic access to better mapping and geological data; and streamlining leasing and permitting for new mines. “The United States must not remain reliant on foreign competitors like Russia and China for the critical minerals needed to keep our economy strong and our country safe,” Trump said. The order comes after the Interior Department and the U.S. Geological Survey published a report earlier this week that detailed U.S. dependence on foreign competitors for its supply of certain minerals. The report identified 23 out of 88 minerals that are priorities for U.S. national defense and the economy because they are components in products ranging from batteries to military equipment. The list included rare earths metals, lithium, graphite and other minerals.  That report did not offer policy recommendations, but Zinke said he would rely on the findings as he prioritizes research into certain mineral deposit areas on federal land and plans policies to promote mining. Twenty of the 23 critical minerals that the United States relies on are sourced from China. Much of the world’s lithium is produced in Australia and Chile, with the bulk of the world’s reserves straddling huge salt flats in the so-called lithium triangle of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina.  Lithium exports from Chile, for example, approached $600 million in 2016, or roughly 40 percent of the global market by volume, according to Chile development agency Corfo. Lithium producers SQM, Albemarle and FMC Lithium are among the region’s top producers. ",1
"SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean soldier who suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash over the border to South Korea this week stabilized on Wednesday after a second round of surgery, a doctor treating him said. The soldier, whose rank and identity have not been disclosed, was flown by helicopter to hospital on Monday after his escape to South Korea in a hail of bullets fired by North Korean soldiers. Wednesday s surgery was  successful  in terms of staunching bleeding and the soldier had  stabilized much , said Lee Cook-jong, the surgeon in charge of his treatment. However, he remained unconscious and was not out of the woods, as complications from a severe hip fracture and possible infection remained major concerns, Lee said.   We will be able to tell you after about 10 days,  Lee told reporters at a briefing, when asked about the soldier s chances of surviving. On Tuesday, government and military officials said the soldier was in critical condition but doctors expected him to live. The soldier made his escape in a border  peace village  on the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas. At first, he sped toward the border in a four-wheel drive vehicle but was forced to abandon it and flee on foot when one of its wheels came loose, South Korean officials said earlier. He was hit by about seven bullets before he took cover behind a South Korean structure in a Joint Security Area (JSA) inside the demilitarized zone. Doctors removed five bullets from him earlier and one more on Wednesday. North Korea has remained silent on the issue, while no unusual activity has been detected at the border where the soldier defected, the South s Unification Ministry said.   There will need to be some questioning on why he defected after his treatment is over,  ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a regular briefing.  Monday was the first time since 2007 a North Korean soldier had defected across the JSA. ",1
"Almost immediately following the Nov. 8 election, Trump and his fledgling administration made a point of denying that they were in contact with Russia about anything. Now his own national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is saying otherwise. Flynn has more or less said that he might have discussed the sanctions privately with Russia s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. But there are nine officials who all say he definitely did.Flynn first denied the allegations rather emphatically, according to a report from the Washington Post. However, he walked it back through his spokesman later on, who said that he  indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn t be certain that the topic never came up. That s an interesting way of not answering a question, but it might get him off the hook just a little. The Post reports that no fewer than nine officials, who have access to reports from law enforcement and intelligence agencies that monitor communications of Russian diplomats, say that Flynn s references to the sanctions Obama imposed following the election were explicit and clear. Two also said that Flynn actually told Russia not to overreact to the penalties since all of this could be discussed again after Trump was sworn in.A third official said that either Flynn had lied to Mike Pence, who flatly denied the allegations, too, or that Pence misspoke (knowing this administration, it s the former).Pence told CBS   Face the Nation  the following: I talked to General Flynn about that conversation and actually was initiated on Christmas Day he had sent a text to the Russian ambassador to express not only Christmas wishes but sympathy for the loss of life in the airplane crash that took place. It was strictly coincidental that they had a conversation. They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States  decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia. After host John Dickerson pressed him on whether Flynn had ever had a conversation about sanctions with Kislyak at any time, Pence said: Well, look. General Flynn has been in touch with diplomatic leaders, security leaders in some 30 countries. That s exactly what the incoming national security advisor should do. But what I can confirm, having spoken to him about it, is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions. He then finished that part of the interview with,  I don t believe there were more conversations. U.S. intelligence agencies became suspicious after Putin s lackluster response to our kicking out all of their diplomats, and they began to look for evidence suggesting that he was promised relief. They discovered that conversations between Flynn and Kislyak had happened around the time we announced the new sanctions and kicked their diplomats out.The administration s position was to deny, deny, deny, because of course. But Flynn isn t exactly denying it anymore. This may have something to do with Congress seeking to limit Trump s ability to ease the sanctions. It may have anything to do with anything   maybe he just feels backed into a corner now.The point is, of all the lies coming out of this administration, this is one of the biggest and the worst thus far. Oddly enough, both Flynn and his son seem to have deleted their Twitter accounts. That could be for any reason, but it s just a little too coincidental to the Post s report.Now we get to wonder what else this administration has done to aid an official enemy. Working to rebuild relationships and strengthen ties is one thing. Working to aid an enemy is another, and that s what Flynn (and by extension, Trump) has done.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",0
"If you haven t heard, the Trump administration is making conservative wet dreams come true by gutting every social program imaginable   including Meals on Wheels, which provides elderly and disabled people with food and occasional company. This development is not shocking to most of us, but 56-year-old Georgia resident Linda Preast somehow had no idea this sort of thing would happen when she voted for a gigantic orange billionaire with a long history of telling the poor to f*ck off.Preast has been wheelchair-bound since she had a stroke two years ago and relies on Meals on Wheels for food. But now that it s not just about building a wall and getting all those damn Muslims out of the country, now that sh*t is getting real, Preast is realizing she may have made a mistake.Are you surprised?  CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller asked Preast about the cuts to the Meals on Wheels program. Yeah,  Preast said.  Because he was told   I was under the influence that he was going to help us. To be clear, there was never any reason to think Donald Trump would help anyone outside his tax bracket. We can t spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great,  says White House Budget director Mick Mulvaney, who calls the cuts to Meals on Wheels and other programs designed to help the less fortunate  compassionate. Asked what she would tell Donald Trump to convince him not to cut funding to a program that helps her, Preast replied What if it was your momma? But it s not Donald Trump s  momma  and he doesn t care about the majority of Americans   even his supporters.While the government has decided that a program that feeds 2.4 million people a year  doesn t work,  Americans disagree. Ever since the budget was announced, donations have been pouring in from people who desperately want to save a program that helps so many. The program has seen a 500 percent increase in volunteers and a 50 percent increase in online donations, but it s still not enough. The scary thing about that is that funding is already not keeping up with pace,  Jenny Bertolette, vice president of communications for Meals on Wheels America says.  There are already demands that we can t meet. There is already a waitlist crisis   If this budget was enacted, it would obviously just make matters so much worse.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rick Santorum withdrew from the race for the U.S. Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday and said he would endorse Senator Marco Rubio in the race for the White House. Santorum, a 57-year-old former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, won the Iowa caucuses four years ago but managed only 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa contest on Monday. Santorum, in an appearance on Fox News announcing his withdrawal and endorsement of Rubio, called the Florida senator “a tremendously gifted young man and ... a born leader.” He said Rubio “can bring this country together, not just moderates and conservatives but young and old.” Rubio, 44, finished third in Monday’s Iowa caucuses, the first contest in the state-by-state battle to decide who will be the Republican nominee in the November presidential election. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas finished first in Iowa, putting a dent in real estate tycoon Donald Trump’s standing as the Republican front-runner. Santorum’s withdrawal leaves nine Republican candidates in the 2016 White House race, with the next contest in New Hampshire on Tuesday. U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky announced earlier on Wednesday he was suspending his campaign after a fifth-place finish in Iowa.  A favorite of the Christian right, Santorum announced his White House bid in May with an eye on economic issues. He campaigned on a promise to boost the middle class,eliminate the Internal Revenue Service and crack down on illegalimmigration. Santorum won a reputation as a strong social conservative in Congress, where he opposed same-sex marriage and the teaching of evolution in schools.

"PARIS (Reuters) - France s foreign minister said on Wednesday that Donald Trump s verbal jousting with North Korea was perhaps not the best method to handle the nuclear crisis and urged the U.S. president to focus his attention on raising diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang. Bellicose statements by Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in recent weeks have created fears that a miscalculation could lead to action with untold ramifications, particularly since Pyongyang conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3.  Trump s method is perhaps not the best, but at the same time we shouldn t mix up the responsibilities,  Jean-Yves Le Drian told BFM TV.  The country that is breaking with nuclear international agreements is North Korea. President Trump is reacting forcefully to this, but without a doubt there is a way to act in a different way by putting pressure and sanctions.   North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho on Monday accused Trump of declaring war on North Korea and threatened that Pyongyang would shoot down U.S. warplanes flying near the Korean Peninsula after American bombers flew close to it last Saturday. The North Korean minister was reacting to Trump s Twitter comments that Kim and Ri  won t be around much longer  if they acted on their threats toward the United States. Le Drian repeated that a maximum amount of pressure needed to be placed on Pyongyang to get it back to the negotiating table, but warned there was a risk of an accidental military escalation.   The world is living in a dangerous period,  he said.  At the moment we re at a verbal clash, but there could be an incident. We need to avoid incidents.   ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said on Friday it had dropped a site in Redington Township, Maine, from a list of potential U.S. sites to deploy more ground-based missile defense interceptors in addition to those in Alaska and California. The agency said other potential sites in New York, Michigan and Ohio remained under consideration, but stressed that no decision had been made to deploy or construct an additional site. MDA said the decision was made after extensive surveys of the potential Maine site, the Center for Security Forces Detachment Kittery Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape Facility (SERE East). “The (Maine) site presented irreversible environmental impacts, significant constructability concerns, and extensive costs associated with developing infrastructure in a remote area,” MDA said in a statement. The Pentagon said in January 2014 that it would conduct environmental impact studies for the four possible missile defense sites in line with a directive from Congress in 2013. The Missile Defense Agency reiterated on Friday that current interceptors on the West Coast would be able to defend the country against missile attacks from countries such as North Korea and Iran. U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern about Iran’s efforts to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles. MDA said that completing the required site studies and environmental impact statements would shorten the timeline to build such a site, if a decision were made in the future to proceed. Kingston Reif, director of disarmament and threat reduction policy at the nonprofit Arms Control Association, said the remaining three environmental impact studies were due to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2016, which ends Sept. 30. Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said the Maine site was likely deemed too far north to provide protection for sites in the central United States. ",1
"Speaking to BBC Newsnight in a rare interview, Justice Ginsburg reiterated the importance of the free press. I read the Washington Post and the New York Times every day, and I think that the reporters are trying to tell the public the way things are,  she said.Justice Ginsburg was nominated by Bill Clinton and is regarded as a liberal.Justice Ginsburg was careful to avoid commenting directly on Donald Trump s presidency.Before the election, in July 2016, Justice Ginsburg criticised Donald Trump   calling him  a faker . She later said she regretted making the comments.Watch: Think of what the press has done in the United States,  she said citing the Watergate scandal.  That story might never have come out if we didn t have the free press that we do. Asked about the rise of the so-called  post truth world , Justice Ginsburg said:  I am optimistic in the long run. A great man once said that the true symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle. It is the pendulum. And when the pendulum swings too far in one direction it will go back. Some terrible things have happened in the United States but one can only hope that we learn from those bad things. Justice Ginsburg said she was encouraged by the Women s March, which saw millions in the US and around the world take part in anti-Trump protests. I ve never seen such a demonstration   both the numbers and the rapport of the people in that crowd. There was no violence, it was orderly. So yes, we are not experiencing the best times but there is there is reason to hope that that we will see a better day. Justice Ginsburg has been on the Supreme Court since 1993 and   at 83 years-old   is the oldest serving member.Asked how much longer she would stay in post, she said:  At my age you have to take it year by year. I know I m OK. What will be next year? She added:  I m hopeful however, because my most senior colleague the one who most recently retired, Justice John Paul Stevens, stepped down at age 90. So I have a way to go.    BBC",0
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner reported personal income of more than $188.1 million in 2015, and 90 percent of the former private equity investor’s earnings came from capital gains, according to income tax returns he released on Friday. Rauner, a Republican, and his wife, Diana, paid federal taxes of $51.6 million and $6.9 million in state taxes in 2015. Of the total income, $169.5 million was from capital gains, though no details were released on the source of those profits. “I believe as the good book says to whom much has been given from whom much is expected in return,” Rauner said at a news conference when asked about his tax returns. Rauner, who has led a fight against Democrats controlling Illinois’ legislature in the country’s longest-running state fiscal impasse, and his wife contributed $21.7 million individually to various Illinois political campaigns this year to weaken Democratic control of the state legislature and dislodge the state’s long-running budget stalemate, campaign records show. Illinois has not had a full operating budget for 17 months. Republicans netted four seats in the Illinois House and two seats in the state Senate in Tuesday’s elections, but Democrats retained control of both legislative chambers and defeated Rauner’s choice for comptroller. A separate filing from Rauner’s family’s foundation showed $53.6 million in assets at the end of 2015 and $11.6 million in charitable giving for the year. In 2014, Rauner and his wife reported $58.3 million in earnings. Because the Rauners’ assets are in a blind trust, an aide said the couple is “screened from all financial decisions” and cannot explain the increase in their income. A spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan  declined comment on the governor’s earnings, but a top Madigan ally said Rauner’s wealth puts him out of touch with the electorate. “I don’t know how he can claim to ever understand the problems of regular, ordinary Illinoisans,” said Democratic Representative Lou Lang. Madigan and Democratic Senate President John Cullerton, Chicago attorneys who maintain property-tax appeal practices, do not release their tax returns. ",1
"George Soros is sticking his nose into voter ID laws and throwing money into lawsuits in several states to get the law overturned. Is this a true effort to overturn the laws or just an effort to gin the base up to vote? There s absolutely nothing wrong with having voter ID! Soros needs to slither away .Hillary Clinton s top campaign lawyer is behind a multi-state push challenging voter identification laws implemented in recent years, efforts that are expected to reach numerous other states ahead of the 2016 elections.Marc Elias, a top campaign lawyer for Hillary Clinton and a partner at the Washington, D.C., law firm Perkins Coie, has filed lawsuits in three states thus far. The nationwide campaign is being fueled with money from the liberal billionaire George Soros.Elias first began exploring the possible challenges back in January 2014. Soros then became involved, vowing to throw his weight behind the effort in collaboration with Elias. We hope to see these unfair laws, which often disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in our society, repealed,  Soros told the New York Times. It is disingenuous to suggest that these laws are meant to protect against voter fraud, which is nearly nonexistent,  Soros political adviser Michael Vachon added.  Clearly they are meant to give Republicans a political advantage on Election Day. Soros has pledged $5 million to propel the campaign. Elias did not return a request for comment concerning his dealings with Soros or the total number of lawsuits they plan on bringing forward. A request for comment from George Soros s press office was also not returned by press time.Democrats ramped up their efforts last month to challenge voter ID laws implemented by Republican legislatures and governors, claiming that the laws disenfranchise minority voters.The first in the series of lawsuits was filed in Ohio on May 8. Three weeks later, on June 1, a second suit was filed in Wisconsin. On June 11, a third lawsuit was filed in Virginia. Further suits are expected to follow in other states.Elias is working independently on behalf of his firm, Perkins Coie, though the Clinton camp supports the effort. Perkins Coie has pulled in more than $40 million from Democratic clients since 2000.The suits came as Hillary Clinton made comments about voting in a number of public speeches.During a speech in Houston on June 4 at historically black Texas Southern University, Hillary Clinton called for a universal, automatic voter registration for 18-year-olds along with early voting up to 20 days before an election. I call on Republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear-mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they re so scared of letting citizens have their say,  Clinton said during the speech.True the Vote, a right-leaning vote-monitoring organization, sees the campaign as a political stunt to rile up apathetic voters who may not have the same excitement for Clinton as they did for Obama.Read more: WFB",0
"While most people have pretty much forgotten that Florida Governor Jeb Bush was actually a Republican presidential candidate not too long ago, it seems that he can t let it go. After being overshadowed by candidates like Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and the party s presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, Jeb has come to the surface to let everyone know that it wasn t his fault he lost.On Monday, the younger Bush reminded everyone that just like his big brother, he is also capable of spewing moronic garbage. In an interview with former Bush press secretary Nicolle Wallace, sore loser Jeb! made sure to remind Americans that the real reason he didn t win in South Carolina was because of the Pope.In discussing what went wrong in his presidential campaign that prevented him from surpassing the other candidates, Jeb said,  The Pope intervening in American politics didn t help. Wallace was shocked and pointed out You re Catholic, blaming the Pope! Bush reiterated that he wasn t blaming the Pope   but clearly Pope Francis  inconvenient mass had cost Jeb everything: No, no. I m not blaming. Talking about, basically, open borders at a time with the whole Trump phenomenon was to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. he goes to the border for a massive mass, and he had every right to preach the gospel there, I don t think he should be intervening, I don t think he understood he was intervening in our political affairs. That generated a lot of news and stopped the momentum. When Wallace asked Jeb to specify just how Pope Francis had helped the media kill his campaign, Jeb explained: The news cycle was dominated by that. Trump, to his credit, was very smart at exploiting these kind of opportunities. He s a master at understanding how the media works more than anybody I ve ever seen in politics, kudos for him for kind of creating the environment and then manipulating the environment to his effect. Jeb s comments are so ridiculous, they might as well have come from Ben Carson. Not only is Jeb criticizing the Pope, but he s praising Trump, who dissed the Catholic leader. Jeb is also in an insane amount of denial over the  three-way tie  for second place, because he seriously thinks that if the Pope hadn t ruined everything, he could have won. According to statistics, Trump, Rubio and Cruz all had over 22 percent of the vote each. Jeb lost South Carolina with 7.8 percent. But I m sure it was because of  the Pope. You can watch Jeb blame the demise of his disastrous campaign on the world s most famous religious leader below:Featured image via Gage Skidmore and Martin Schulz",0

"Speaking to Bill Maher about her participation in the Women s March in DC,  Hanoi Jane  Fonda remarked about her ability to use her celebrity to express her hate for Donald Trump to the masses. Fonda told Maher that one of the benefits of being a celebrity is that you can bring attention to things that need to be addressed, she then went on to refer to President Trump as the  Predator in Chief . Of course, Hanoi Jane had no evidence whatsoever to back up such a hideous claim, yet, she made the claim anyhow. As it turns out, Hanoi Jane actually knew about a certain sexual predator who actually assaulted a much younger actress only one year ago. That younger actress was Rosana Arquette, who shared her horrible experience with the  celebrity  Jane Fonda. Fonda, who bragged about having so much power to bring attention to important issues, did absolutely nothing about it.Hypocrite Hanoi Jane would rather stay mum about an actual sexual predator who was harming so many young women in her industry, than risk being ostracized in Hollywood. It was better to just stick to the  hate Trump  script and get along with the other sickening hypocrites in Hollywood than to expose a serial sexual predator who should ve been stopped years ago if there weren t so many self-serving and shallow human beings running around Hollywood. Watch:Hanoi Jane s very comfortable trashing President Trump who she believes can t hurt her career, but when it comes to the mega-Democrat donor, and Hollywood kingpin producer, Harvey Weinstein, all bets are off..

It came as a shock and a great disappointment,  Fonda said. I only met Harvey when I was old and Harvey goes for young because that s more vulnerable. She added that she was proud of the victims for speaking out but it wasn t a unique or isolated case and specifically mentioned Bill Cosby s history. This is not unique, this goes on at the most horrendous high levels,  she said. I m glad it s coming out, I m so proud of those fellow actors that are speaking up. I know that it has taken a long time. It is a very, very, very hard thing to do. You don t get anything out of it as the person who has been victimized but it is important that it come out.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump created a commission on Thursday to investigate voter fraud and suppression, the White House said, a move that follows Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump signed an executive order creating the bipartisan Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which would be chaired by Vice President Mike Pence, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. The move provoked anger among top U.S. civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers, who called it a voter suppression tactic. Trump, who took office in January, has said there was  widespread voter fraud in the November election. The Republican won the White House through victory in the Electoral College, which tallies wins in states, but lost the popular vote to  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by some 3 million ballots. Trump said in January he would seek an investigation into voter fraud in the election, even though the consensus among state officials and election experts is that it is rare in the United States. “The President’s ‘Election Integrity’ Commission is purpose-built to encourage and enable voter suppression,” said U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in a statement. She said the commission would lend legitimacy to state efforts to enact discriminatory voting laws. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Elijah Cummings, ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, issued similar statements. Top civil rights leaders said the commission would encourage voter suppression by justifying new barriers like requiring identity cards for voting.  “When Attorney General Jeff Sessions led a similar effort as a former prosecutor in Alabama, it had a chilling effect on the black vote,” said Kristen Clarke, the head of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.  Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union voting project, said, “Signing a piece of paper will not make Trump’s false statements about voter fraud true.” The bipartisan commission would not be limited to investigating Trump’s election fraud claims but look at issues that have been raised over many years.  “The commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American people’s confidence in the integrity of federal elections, and provide the president with a report that identifies system vulnerabilities,” Huckabee Sanders said. She said the report would be complete by 2018. The new panel coincides with several U.S. investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the November election, including selectively leaking hacked emails and circulating false news reports. Russian officials have denied such interference. ",1

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama met on Monday with a team of national security advisers to discuss U.S. efforts to combat Islamic State following last week’s attacks on Brussels, the White House said. “The President was briefed that there is currently no specific, credible intelligence of any plot to conduct similar attacks here in the United States,” the White House said.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations called on Thursday for a humanitarian pause to allow an estimated 20,000 trapped civilians to escape from the Syrian city of Raqqa, and urged the U.S.-led coalition to rein in air strikes that have caused casualties. Amnesty International said on Thursday that a U.S.-led coalition campaign to oust Islamic State from Raqqa had killed hundreds of civilians, and those remaining face greater risk as the fight intensifies in its final stages.   On Raqqa, our urging today from the UN side to the members of the humanitarian task force ... is that they need to do whatever is possible to make it possible for people to escape Raqqa,  Jan Egeland, U.N. humanitarian adviser on Syria, told reporters in Geneva.  Boats on the Euphrates must not be attacked, people who come out cannot risk air raids when and where they come out,  he said.  Now is the time to think of possibilities, pauses or otherwise that might facilitate the escape of civilians, knowing that Islamic State fighters are doing their absolute best to use them as human shields,  he said. Humanitarian pauses were agreed between the warring sides last December to allow the evacuation of civilians from then rebel-held eastern Aleppo, Egeland said. But he added that the United Nations has no contact with Islamic State fighters who have controlled Raqqa since 2014. Egeland, referring to U.S-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said:  There is heavy shelling from the surrounding and encircling SDF forces and there are constant air raids from the coalition. So the civilian casualties are large and there seems to be no real escape for these civilians.  Syrian government forces, backed by the Russian air force and Iran-backed militias, have also been advancing against IS south of the River Euphrates that forms Raqqa city s southern edge.  Inside Raqqa city, on both sides, conditions are very bleak and it is very hard to assist in all areas,  Egeland said. The United Nations is still assessing the outcome of talks held this week in Riyadh between the three Syrian opposition groups - who failed to unite - Ramzy Ezzeldin Ramzy, the U.N. deputy special envoy for Syria, said.  Asked whether Syria peace talks would be held in Geneva in September, he said:  We are waiting to get a full picture as to what happened in Riyadh, and we will have further consultations with the interested parties.  And on that basis a decision will be taken as to when these talks will take place.   ",1

"Iowa Rep. Steve King (R-Of Course) is currently under fire for tweeting out something that would only be said by a white supremacist   that we can t  restore our civilization with somebody else s babies. While King s message earned ALLCAPS praise from former KKK leader David Duke, the rest of us are left wondering why Iowans would want this alleged man to represent their state.On Monday, King stopped by CNN to attempt to explain away his hateful tweet, and it didn t go well for him at all. Well, of course I meant exactly what I said,  King told CNN s  New Day  as he blamed  the Left  for wanting to destroy  Western civilization : This is an effort on the left, I think, to break down the American civilization, the American culture, and turn it into something entirely different. I m a champion for western civilization and yes our English language is a big part of it. It s a carrier of freedom. Embarrassingly, King refused to say that Muslim-Americans, Christian-Americans, and other Americans of different background are equal, instead saying that they contribute differently to our culture and our civilization. I d say they re all created in the image of God, and they re equal in his eyes. And if they re citizens of the United States, they re equal in the eyes of the law,  King said.  Individuals will contribute differently not equally to this civilization and certain groups of people will contribute more to this society than other groups of people will, that s just a statistical fact. King says he is  promoting the birth rate in America  to restore the  rule of law  to what he views as a  superior civilization.

"How many times more are we going to get to say this before 2017?  While Republicans were bashing Obama for <insert situation here>, he was busy taking care of the same problem they were crying about better than they ever could have hoped to do.  This is a common theme between Republicans and President Obama. Every time President Obama does something good, they call it the biggest disaster imaginable. Do they think we re not watching?Remember during President Obama s Iranian nuclear deal, when Republicans said  going easy  on Iran (translation   not invading their country) would only make them a worse threat?Huge shock incoming: literally nothing Republicans swore would happen from the Iran deal happened. In fact, yet again the exact opposite happened.The latest proof of President Obama s phenomenal and historic success comes with news of the recent Iranian elections. Supporters of Hassan Rouhani swept to power in run-off elections that gave the Iranian moderate reformist movement legislative control of the Iranian parliament for the first time in over 10 years.Forty-two percent of the total seats were won by Rouhani s moderate supporters. Independents took nearly 30 percent of the remaining seats, and the vast majority of them are also moderate reformists. This leaves a paltry 28 percent left for the Iranian hardliners, which essentially amounts to a seat at the  kid s table,  where their rhetoric means diddly squat and they can do no legislative harm.The landslide success of the Iranian moderate reformists has been linked directly to the success of the nuclear agreement reached between President Rouhani and the United States. The deal brought a great amount of both social and financial relief to the people of Iran, and Rouhani s big win is being viewed as an endorsement of it by the Iranian people.The seriousness of this would be difficult to overstate. President Obama not only won on the Iran deal, but he helped move into place a reformist government that could carry things far beyond the deal alone.As if the electoral results were not enough of a statement for a more moderate future in Iran, the first priority of the new government is going to be a bill to guarantee citizens  rights. This is IRAN we are talking about. The idea of citizen rights being the first priority for a newly elected government is astounding, considering they were viewed by most of the world as a terrorist state for decades.While Iran won t be turning into a mirror image of the West anytime soon, just the fact that the nation took such a huge pivot so quickly is all anyone needs to know when it comes to how President Obama did on the Iran deal.Republicans just can t win when it comes to President Obama. Every time they bash the hell out of him in the media for handling a situation poorly, he literally does the exact opposite   quite often simultaneously   while the rest of the world laughs at the GOP. We sure are going to miss him.Featured image via Getty",0
"Hillary Clinton s camp took aim at Donald Trump and his recent efforts to lure black voters into backing him, slamming his  minority outreach  efforts as  shameful, insulting and cowardly. Marlon Marshall, Hillary for America s Director of State campaigns and Political Engagement, released a statement on Thursday in response to the latest update on Trump s upcoming visit to an African-American church in Detroit. Not only will Trump not be speaking to the congregation, but the one-on-one interview he will be having with the pastor after the service will be carefully scripted. Donald Trump s latest gimmick to act as if he cares about the black community is downright shameful, insulting and cowardly,  Marshall wrote. After 14 months of neglecting us, Donald Trump is once again dodging substantive conversations and ducking questions about the issues that impact our community. Not surprisingly, Trump s ignorance on issues like the economy, criminal justice reform, the meaning of quality health care or systemic racism, has forced him to resort to scripted conversations and staged engagements with our communities. According to the leaked script, the questions that will be asked by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson will be written in advance and the GOP nominee s answers will be carefully prepared ahead of time as well. Marshall slammed Trump for this bogus attempt at  scripted  outreach to the black community. The problem is, our community can see through this: outreach to African Americans cannot be scripted; leaders ought to be prepared to address the hard truths about race and justice in our country,  Marshall wrote. And Trump s discomfort on addressing these issues only reinforces that he s unfit to be our president. Trump s so-called  minority outreach  has not been going over as well as he hoped. What was his master plan to woo black voters and make them forget that he is endorsed by the KKK? Tell them that their lives suck so bad already that they don t have anything to lose by voting for him. Gee, I simply can t imagine why bedbugs and the Bubonic plague are polling better than Trump among blacks and Hispanics right now.Featured image via Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images",0

"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya s European-backed coast guard on Saturday turned back more than 150 migrants trying to reach Italy by boat amid its heightened efforts to block such crossings of the Mediterranean. The migrants, packed into a single rubber boat, were intercepted off the coast between the towns of Al Khoms and Garabulli, east of Tripoli, after traveling through the night. The boat was close to an Italian coast guard ship patrolling in international waters when they were cut off and taken aboard a Libyan vessel, dashing their hopes of reaching Europe. The rubber boat was being rocked by heavy waves and the motor had cut out.  We were shouting,  they are blocking us, they are blocking us . We were crying, pleading for help,  said Patrice Emani, a 27-year-old from Mali. He said he was making his second attempted crossing from Libya. He was detained in the western Libyan city of Zawiya earlier in the year, but his family paid for him to be released. The captain of the Libyan ship that returned the migrants to Tripoli port, Colonel Abdelhamid Adengouz, said they had been rescued from drowning in rough conditions, with cooperation from Italy.  The migrants were saved from death,  he said.  There was an Italian ship present that helped us.  A large majority of migrants traveling to Europe by sea depart from western Libya, where people smuggling has flourished amid lawlessness and a collapsing economy. But there has been a sharp drop in departures since July due to armed factions preventing boats from leaving parts of the coast and increased activity from Libyan coast guard units which have received training and technical support from Italy and the European Union. Human rights groups have criticized European policy, saying no migrants should be returned to a country where they face widespread abuse. After migrants are brought back to Libya, they are registered by international agencies before being taken to overcrowded detention centers. Some are offered the chance to return home, while others languish in detention or seek a way out. Most of those intercepted on Saturday were from West African countries, including Mali, Guinea, and Nigeria, and some were from Bangladesh. All but one were male. They said they had paid between 1,500 and 3,000 Libyan dinars ($176-$353 at unofficial market rates) to make the crossing.  I suffered a lot - kidnappings, demands for ransom,  said Christopher Daniel, a 20-year-old Nigerian.  They blindfolded me and forced me to give them money,  he said of a period he spent in captivity in the southern city of Sabha last year.  I don t know what to say or do. All the money I have wasted - what will I tell my parents?  ",1

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday there could be no normal relations with Russia until Moscow ended its support for separatists in Ukraine and returned Crimea, in comments likely to reassure Western allies. Speaking after a dinner where he discussed Russia with NATO foreign ministers on Tuesday, Tillerson took a tougher stance than U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sought better relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said last month after meeting Putin in Vietnam that he believed Putin s denial of accusations that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. That was despite U.S. intelligence agencies  evidence of Russian interference.  At NATO, Tillerson criticized  Russia s continued use of hybrid warfare  and its attempts  to undermine Western institutions  in a reference to the mix of state-sponsored computer hacks and Internet disinformation campaigns that NATO allies  intelligence agencies say is targeted at the West.  This stands as a significant obstacle to normalizing our relations,  Tillerson told reporters. At the NATO dinner with ministers, Tillerson also blamed Russia for interfering in the U.S. election, said a diplomat who was present. Russia has denied meddling. Trump, whose former aides are being investigated after accusations that Putin influenced the election that brought him to the White House, has repeatedly emphasized that it would be better if Russia and the United States could work together.      Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive, has spent much of his time as secretary of state trying to smooth the  America First  foreign policy that has alarmed Trump s allies, but the president has publicly undercut the secretary of state s diplomatic initiatives. His trip to Europe this week was partly overshadowed by reports the White House had a plan to replace him, which Tillerson denied on Wednesday. [L8N1O63LC]   Tillerson stressed to ministers that the Ukraine crisis, which was sparked by Moscow s 2014 annexation of Crimea, was the central issue that blocked better U.S.-Russia ties because seizing sovereign territory was unacceptable, according to a second diplomat present.  The conflict between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014. Russia denies accusations it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters.  People are still dying every day from that violence,  Tillerson said.  Tillerson, who in 2013 as head of Exxon Mobil was awarded the Order of Friendship by Putin, a Russian state honor, said he hoped to agree to deploy U.N. troops to eastern Ukraine, an idea the Russian president floated in September. With an internationally-agreed ceasefire long broken and efforts to revive a 2015 peace deal stalled, peacekeepers could end hostilities and allow trade to resume between Russia and Ukraine. But Tillerson warned there was still a  significant difference between the mandate that a peacekeeping force would be given and the scope of their mandate .  We hope we can close those gaps,  Tillerson said. Russia is keen to see the end of Western sanctions imposed over the Ukraine crisis but European officials fear U.N. peacekeepers would freeze the conflict rather than solving it. Tillerson also cautioned against treating Russia as a partner, saying all meetings with Moscow should be based on issues, not agreed on the basis of a calendar, quashing any hopes of a detente in Moscow s relations with Washington.   I think there is broad consensus among all the NATO members that there is no normalization of dialogue with Russia today,  he said. ",1
"According to the right-wing pastor, Mark Burns, Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders, does not believe in god. That s what Burns told an audience of Trump supporters Thursday in Hickory, North Carolina during a Donald Trump campaign event. Sanders is a Jewish man who has lived a mostly secular life.Burns even went as far to say that Bernie Sanders needs to convert to Christianity. Here s what Burns said in full: Bernie Sanders, who doesn t believe in God, how in the world (are) we going to let Bernie   I mean, really? Bernie s got to get saved, Bernie s got to meet Jesus. He s got to have a coming to Jesus meeting. While he does not participate in organized religion, Sanders has expressed that he does believe in god. During an interview in Rolling Stone, Sanders was asked if he believed in god. Sanders responded, saying: Yeah, I do. I do. I m not into organized religion. But I believe that what impacts you impacts me, that we are all united in one way or another. When children go hungry, I get impacted. When kids die because they can t afford medicine, I get impacted. We are one world and one people. And that belief leads me to the conclusion that we just cannot turn our back on human suffering. Sanders  beliefs are found in both the Jewish faith. From the Talmud,  Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world. Alternatively, the same beliefs are found in the secular organized labor movement. In particular, the International Worker s Union s motto,  An injury to one is an injury to all,  encapsulates Sanders  belief system as he has described it.This is all happening against Trump s threats to Sanders and his supporters. While at the same time, the Republican primary front-runner and his supporters escalate their violent tactics against protestors.Here s a video of Burn s opening address. The relevant comments begin five minutes into the speech.Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube",0
"Our refugee resettlement program needs to bed stopped right now. We need to rethink and regroup on everything about it. The cost is HUGE but security is a big issue too. Here s one example :Two al Qaeda terrorists who had killed American soldiers were able to enter the country as refugees, according to a report released Wednesday from the House Homeland Security committee.Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, two Iraqi refugees settled in Bowling Green, Kentucky, after killing American soldiers, whom they bragged about having  for lunch and dinner.  In 2010, they were caught handling weapons, including included a machine gun and a missile launcher, that they planned to smuggle to insurgents in Iraq. I wouldn t be surprised if there were many more than that,  said Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.  And these are trained terrorists in the art of bombmaking that are inside the United States; and quite frankly, from a homeland security perspective, that really concerns me. The committee s report found that the administration s refugee resettlement program proposal will have  a limited impact on alleviating the overall crisis but could have serious ramifications for U.S. homeland security. Jeh Johnson, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, admitted in October at a hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee that organizations such as the Islamic State might attempt to exploit the Syrian refugee resettlement program. It is true that we are not going to know a whole lot about the Syrians that come forth in this process,  he said.President Obama s refugee resettlement program is now under scrutiny after deadly terrorist attacks in Paris killed more than 120 people and left more than 300 injured on Friday. It is suspected that one of the terrorists entered the country as a refugee.In addition to these attacks, men in Minnesota were apprehended by the feds for trying to join the Islamic State. There is growing concern that the state would be a recruiting ground for the Islamic State because of its large community of Somali refugees.Read more: WFB",0
"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry paid tribute to the European Union on Monday as it tries to heal the wound of Britain’s vote to leave, saying detractors were overlooking what it had achieved in alliance with America. “I ask anyone who questions the importance of the EU or its relationship with the United States, (to consider) not just the history that I articulated, but the increase of prosperity, the rise in the standard of living ... the better protection of rights for individuals in the EU, as a consequence of what we have done together,” Kerry said in Brussels. He was speaking at a joint news conference with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini after a meeting with his European counterparts including Boris Johnson, Britain’s new foreign minister, who led the Leave campaign. His comments sounded like a jab at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who last month forecast the break-up of the EU due to fears over immigration, and at Johnson, who during the campaign compared the EU’s ambitions with those of Hitler and Napoleon. Kerry, a Democrat, spoke of the close ties between the United States and European Union dating back to the U.S. role in freeing Europe from Nazism in World War Two. But he acknowledged that such memories were fading.  “There’s a whole separation of time which has changed attitudes of some people,” he said, adding that in the face of common threats such as Islamist militancy, the EU-U.S. partnership was “as important as it has ever been”. Mogherini responded that it sometimes took a clear-sighted transatlantic view to put Europe’s value into perspective. “I would like to thank you personally, and through you the U.S. administration of President Obama for the strong message and clear message that we always hear from you on the need for a strong and united Europe,” she said.  “Sometimes we need our closest friends, our best friends, to remind us of the extraordinary value of the European Union.” ",1

"The vast majority of Donald Trump s campaign promises were both unworkable and, well, hateful. His promise to  lock (Hillary Clinton) up,  was as empty as it was unifying for those on the rabid right. It was the same with his promise to build a wall along the Mexican border and his promise to  repeal and replace  Obamacare on day one. Occasionally, though, like a broken clock, Trump occasionally got it right, and now Democrats want him to make good on one such promise.Despite the fact that nearly everything Trump adorns with his name is made elsewhere, one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaigns was to force manufacturers to employ Americans.Republicans are doing everything in their power to ensure that Trump doesn t get to keep this campaign promise. There s a bill in the Senate that would help deliver clean water to Americans and help Flint, Michigan with emergency funding. Originally, there was a  buy American and hire American  provision in the bill. That should be non-controversial, right? Well, Republicans, who seem to stand against absolutely everything that s good and right, stripped that part out of the bill back in December. Now Dems want them to bring it back.Sen.

Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) March 24, 2017 Now is the time for President Trump to decide if he will keep his promises by supporting this legislation, or will he go along to get along with Congressional Republicans who have embraced the status quo and blocked this legislation that puts in place a strong Buy America standard,  said Baldwin, who planned to announce the bill at a Wisconsin foundry that makes manhole covers for cities throughout the United States.  The choice for the Republican establishment in Washington is clear: Do you stand with American manufacturers and workers or do you support spending taxpayer dollars on Chinese and Russian steel for American water infrastructure projects?

Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) March 24, 2017Baldwin s bill deals with the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which in the last two decades has delivered nearly $28 billion in financing for more than 12,000 drinking-water projects across the country. Her legislation would mandate that moving forward, the program targets its funding to projects that use only American-made iron and steel.It s unlikely the bill will pass with this provision, but it does put Trump s feet to the fire. If he signs the Republican version (which he almost certainly will), it will be just more evidence that the emperor has no clothes.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",0
"BEIJING (Reuters) - No free fruit in hotel rooms, no free hair cuts and no prawns on the menu - delegates at this week s Communist Party Congress in China can expect austere treatment in keeping with President Xi Jinping s pledge to crack down on corruption and extravagance. Part of Xi s fight against deep-seated graft has been to ensure officials are not seen abusing their positions and wasting public money, after a series of scandals involving high-living bureaucrats ignited public anger. Wang Lilian, who has helped oversee hospitality for delegates at three previous party Congresses, told state radio in remarks reported on Sunday that this time, things are going to be very different. Delegates will, for example, find their hotels bereft of the large welcoming banners and displays of flowers common in previous years. But the biggest difference will be with their rooms and food, Wang said.  There won t be any more fruit put out in rooms, whereas previously there were for delegates and staff. There s none of that this time,  he said. The food was also going to be home-style and simple, Wang said.  There s no sea cucumber, prawns or the like. It s all buffet style.  Delegates won t get free hair cuts or beauty treatments and there won t be any gift shops.  There s none of these services this time,  Wang said. Xi himself has lead the way in promoting simple living, with state media widely reporting on the basic food he eats when on trips around the country, and giving extensive coverage to cases where officials are found to have hoarded gold, owned multiple houses or had a fondness for banquets. Xi has warned, like others before him, that if corruption is not tackled it could affect the party s grip on power. The once-in-five-years Congress opens on Wednesday with a major speech by Xi. ",1

And there s only one thing to say: Yay!  Colbert said during his monologue.  I won!

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court sentenced opposition leader Alexei Navalny to his third jail term this year on Monday, disrupting plans by the long-time Kremlin critic to campaign before Russia s coming election. Russia holds a presidential election in March next year. The incumbent Vladimir Putin has yet to announce his candidacy but is widely expected to do so and to win. Navalny hopes to run, even though Russia s central election commission declared him ineligible because of a suspended prison sentence, which he says was politically motivated. He was detained by police on Friday as he left his Moscow home to attend a pre-election rally in a provincial town and later charged with repeatedly violating laws governing the organisation of public meetings and rallies. A court sentenced him to 20 days in jail on Monday, a term which means he will miss a campaign rally planned in Putin s hometown of St Petersburg on Oct. 7 - the Russian leader s birthday.   Old man Putin is so scared of our meetings in the regions that he decided to make himself happy with a small gift for his jubilee,  Navalny said on Twitter after his sentencing. Navalny has been jailed twice already this year after organising rallies and protests against government corruption. Russian opposition activists say they are coming under increased pressure as the election approaches, with authorities  frequently turning a blind eye to violent attacks.

It would be Scaramucci s first step toward shaking up the communications shop, which has been dominated by former Republican National Committee staffers loyal to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, a former RNC chairman. Short originally worked for the Trump campaign placed on it by Priebus and quit the campaign, sources tell Breitbart News, after the Access Hollywood tape came out. Politico confirmed this report, noting that Short walked out in the middle of the campaign leaving his computer behind only to show back up in January at the behest of the Republican National Committee (RNC) allies in the White House. He was scorned by many of his colleagues for quitting the Trump campaign, only to rejoin as a White House staffer because of Priebus,  Palmeri wrote of Short.  In a story often retold by campaign staffers, they arrived at Trump Tower one morning, months before the election, to see Short s computer left open on his otherwise empty desk. He had quit the campaign that day and never returned. The next time he was seen by former campaign staffers was in January on their first day in the White House, where some were stunned to learn that they were going to have to work alongside him or for some of the press assistants subordinate to him. Multiple White House sources tell Breitbart News that Short was a leaker, and worked closely with now former White House deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh another RNC wing official who was terminated earlier this year for her own suspected leaking.  Breitbart NewsCould Reince Priebus be next?Heavy   Could Short s and Spicer s resignations be a bad omen for the future of Priebus, the former RNC chairman turned chief of staff who once ran the Republican Party in Wisconsin?There certainly seems to be a diminishing in the ranks of his supporters inside the Trump bubble (and he was reported to have opposed the hiring of Scaramucci by The New York Times and other publications). However, Priebus and Scaramucci have publicly spoken positively about each other since Scaramucci was hired. Trump seems to be relying more than before on a tight circle of family members and political outsiders like Scaramucci. The potential shake-up has exacerbated long-simmering tensions between Scaramucci and chief of staff Reince Priebus,  reported The Washington Post. Scaramucci reports to Trump, not Priebus.",0

"SEOUL (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh from violence in Myanmar have been  drained  by the trauma they suffered during the crisis and a struggle to overcome desperate want, the United Nations refugee chief said on Wednesday. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar since late August this year for neighboring Bangladesh, driven out by a military clearance operation in Rakhine State. The refugees  suffering has caused an international outcry, spurring appeals by aid agencies for millions of dollars in funds to tackle the crisis.  I found this was a population that had almost no response. Very passive,  said Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, describing his visit late in September to camps where the refugees were staying.  You almost felt there was nothing left and that everything had been drained by this,  he told Reuters in an interview in his first visit to the South Korean capital. He saw the lassitude as a symptom of trauma, he added.  We haven t seen this kind of trauma for a very long, long time,  the Italian diplomat said.  Maybe I saw it in the  90s in central Africa.  Grandi coordinated UN humanitarian activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo during its 1996-97 civil war. The success of aid efforts by the United Nations and non-government bodies depends on the Myanmar government to defuse the hostility facing humanitarian workers in Rakhine, Grandi said.  It s not political work, it s not to favor one community over the other,  he said.   On the contrary, it s directed to all those who are in need. And when members of the Buddhist community are in need, they certainly qualify for that. I think it s important that they stress that, they do that more,  said Grandi. Tension had been rising between the government and aid agencies even before the spasm of violence that began in late August. Officials had accused the World Food Programme of aiding insurgents after high-energy biscuits were discovered in July at a forest encampment the authorities said belonged to a militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.  Longstanding antipathy among ethnic Rakhine Buddhists - who say the UN and nongovernment bodies favor the Rohingya with aid deliveries   spiked in August, with protesters demanding that aid agencies leave and the U.N. warning staff against rising hostility. Since the Aug. 25 militant attacks in Rakhine, the government has barred most aid agencies, except for the Red Cross organizations, from working in the state s north, and curtailed their activities elsewhere in the state. In several cases aid deliveries have been forcibly blocked by Rakhine Buddhists. The U.N. s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has said the World Food Programme resumed some food distribution in northern Rakhine this month, but limited access meant agencies still do not know how many people were internally displaced over the last three months.   Access remains restricted for most humanitarian actors in northern Rakhine, preventing them from reaching many people in need,  the agency said.  In central Rakhine, humanitarian organizations also continue to face access constraints.  ",1

The ad highlights the landslide victories in Washington and Alaska on Saturday, and Idaho and Utah earlier in the week.The victories are quite impressive because of the sheer number of voters who overwhelmingly supported Sanders. In Idaho, he won with 78% of the vote. While in Utah he received 79%, Alaska 81%, Washington 72%, and Hawaii with 70%.The Sanders  campaign definitely seems to be gaining momentum towards the possibility getting the Democratic nomination. It will be interesting to see how this may help him going forward through upcoming primaries.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOgd3kmaosc]Featured image via video screenshot.",0

"Keep buying Jay Z and Beyonce s music and keep telling us you like their music and see no connection between buying their music and using it to fund Obama s race war Rap mogul Jay Z has quietly used his wealth to post bail for people arrested in protests across the United States against police, an author close to him said Sunday.Dream Hampton, a writer and activist who worked with Jay Z on his 2010 memoir  Decoded,  made the revelations in a series of messages on Twitter that were deleted but were posted by the hip-hop magazine Complex. When we needed money for bail for Baltimore protesters, I  hit Jay up, as I had for Ferguson (and he) wired tens of thousands  of dollars within minutes, read one tweet.She also tweeted that Jay Z and his pop superstar wife Beyonce wrote a  huge check  to support the burgeoning  Black Lives Matter  movement aimed at stopping police brutality.Protests spread last year after a white police officer shot dead African American teenager Michael Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.Major demonstrations, some turning violent, erupted last month in Baltimore after another African American man, Freddie Gray, died from a spinal injury sustained in police custody. The tweets appeared aimed at defending Jay Z and Beyonce, who have faced accusations from some activists that they have only paid lip service to the cause without tapping into the couple s estimated $1 billion net worth.Hampton later wrote that she deleted the tweets because Jay Z  would be pi-issed to see I was offering evidence  that he is taking action.Jay Z on Saturday performed in New York as an exclusive for Tidal, the music streaming service he has launched with fellow stars.In a freestyle segment, Jay Z paid homage to Brown and Gray   and belittled Tidal s rivals Spotify and Apple.Jay Z and Beyonce met with Brown and Gray s families last week at a peace concert in Baltimore by Prince, leaving without making public appearances.The power couple are also strong supporters of President Barack Obama, throwing a multimillion-dollar fundraiser for him during his 2012 campaign.Via: Yahoo News",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said he had a “very productive” meeting with President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday and was encouraged by progress in talks on the Air Force One replacement fleet and on fighter planes. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements on Air Force One, streamlining the process ... all that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost.

"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump has dismissed his vulgar sexual comments about women that surfaced on a video as “locker room talk,” but his explanation did little to soothe the queasiness of Esther Rosser, a 71-year-old grandmother from Virginia. “I know he apologized, and all you can do is apologize, but he could have said more,” said Rosser, who has voted Republican her whole life but decided this weekend that she would support Trump’s rival for president, Democrat Hillary Clinton. “He disrespected us,” she said of Trump, referring to women in general. Rosser’s misgivings echoed many of the sentiments expressed by more than two dozen women voters interviewed by Reuters who, as recently as September, had not decided whether they would support Trump or Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. In the informal survey conducted by phone the day after Sunday’s presidential debate, many women said they were appalled by the 2005 video in which Trump bragged of kissing and groping women without consent. The video surfaced on the Washington Post’s website on Friday afternoon.  Several of the voters also said they disliked the Republican presidential candidate’s strategy of highlighting the infidelities of Hillary Clinton’s husband, Bill Clinton, in an effort to defend his own conduct, or shift attention away from it. “I didn’t like the fact that he was attacking Hillary on things her husband did,” said Connie Sasso, a 66-year-old retiree from Missouri. “It’s wrong - it’s just wrong.” In the second presidential debate with Clinton on Sunday in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump said he was embarrassed by the video but dismissed his comments as “locker room talk.” He also accused Hillary Clinton of attacking women who had alleged sexual misconduct by her husband, who was president from 1993 to 2001. Trump’s criticism of Bill Clinton’s infidelities drew applause from supporters at a Monday rally he held in Pennsylvania. But Trump, whose core voters are overwhelmingly male, has struggled to appeal to women, who made up 53 percent of the U.S. electorate in the 2012 election. If Trump is unable to narrow the gender gap, he will be unable to overcome Clinton’s lead in the polls. “I can’t with good conscience vote for someone with that kind of mindset to the presidency,” said LeighAnn Chase, a 27-year-old nursing student from Lakeland, Florida.  As a woman, she was “floored” by Trump’s comments, and disgusted that others would seek to justify them, said Chase, a registered Republican who said she is now backing Clinton. Patsy Bennewise, 58, of North Little Rock, Arkansas, never voted for Clinton’s husband during the nearly 10 years he was her state’s governor. But her streak of never voting for a Clinton is set to end in November when she said she will cast her ballot for the Democratic candidate. She said of Trump: “He’s turned the presidential election into a mockery.” Not all undecided women voters contacted by Reuters came out against Trump. Amy Fryzelka, a 37-year-old tutor from Kansas City, Missouri, said she thought Trump’s comments were “horrible” but she believed his personal life would not influence how he would govern. She said she is leaning toward the Republican candidate because she believes Clinton is too deceptive. “I’d prefer not to vote for either of them, really,” Fryzelka said. Jane Simmons, 78, of Sterling Heights, Michigan, also said she would rather not vote for either Clinton or Trump. Simmons, whose mail-in ballot arrived on Friday, hours before she and other Americans learned of Trump’s lewd comments, said the video led her to consider backing Clinton.  “This is an indication of what the man is, although it was a decade ago, I don’t think he changed very much,” she said. “I don’t believe he’s got a conscience.” For Rosser, the Virginia grandmother, the decision to cast her vote for Clinton came when her 14-year-old granddaughter asked her to explain why Trump would say the things he said in the video. “He’s not a good role model for kids,” she said.

"Oh boy! This is getting good! Bill Clinton is now accusing the FBI of serving up a  load of bull  in the comments about the investigation into Hillary s e-mails. How idiotic is it to publicly slam the FBI? I guess  Slick Willy  isn t so slick anymore. all we have to say about this is KEEP ON TALKIN  SLICK WILLY!Bill Clinton is accusing the FBI director of serving up  the biggest load of bull I ve ever heard    marking the first significant public comments from the husband of the Democratic nominee on the scandal that s plagued his wife s campaign for over a year. First of all, the FBI director said, when he testified before Congress, he had to amend his previous day s statement that she had never received any emails marked classified,  Clinton told journalists at an Asian American Journalists Association meeting in Las Vegas on Friday, making a strong defense for Hillary Clinton.He added,  They saw two little notes with a  C  on it   this is the biggest load of bull I ve ever heard   that were about telephone calls that she needed to make. The State Department typically puts a little  C  on it to discourage people from discussing it in public in the event the secretary of state, whoever it is, doesn t make a telephone call.

"Four months ago, Oprah, the woman who made her fortune off preying on women s emotions and counting on their inability to think for themselves, gave Hillary s vagina an endorsement. She gave women absolutely no credible reason to support her, but reminded them, when you walk into the voting booth the choice is clear, one candidate has a vagina and the other one does not: Regardless of your politics, it s a seminal moment for women. What this says is, there is no ceiling, that ceiling just went boom! It says anything is possible when you can be leader of the free world. What Oprah s essentially saying to women who hang on her every word is that it doesn t matter if you or your husband don t have a job. It doesn t matter if you live in a town supported by coal that Hillary promised to destroy. It doesn t matter that Hillary left our nation s top secret classified emails exposed for anyone in the world to see, simply because she believed she was above the law, or that every other person in the history of our government has been punished for less serious breaches of our national security.  Much like she tried to convince her viewers in 2008 that American needed a black President, she s now trying to convince her viewers they need to elect our first woman for President. Am I the only woman who finds Oprah s dumbing down of women to be an insult to my intelligence? Yesterday, Oprah weighed in on the election and gave an endorsement for Hillary that was an insult to the intelligence of every woman still clinging to her failed network. She essentially told them, you may not be smart enough to follow the news or to understand the seriousness of the content of the emails being leaked that prove Hillary was using her position as Secretary of State to funnel money into her Clinton Foundation. You may not even be smart enough to understand the seriousness of the recent videos released by James O Keefe of Project Veritas that show Democrats admitting to committing massive voter fraud for decades and inciting violence at Trump rallies. You may not even be smart enough to know these people featured in the undercover videos admit that Hillary and the DNC are fully aware of, and are funding their illegal activities. Yes, these same people are tied to Hillary who admit on tape they were responsible for the unprecedented violence a horrified America witnessed at Donald Trump s rally in her hometown of Chicago But let me tell you, that nasty woman you see on TV just ignore what you see, because, as Oprah states,  She s not coming over to your house! You don t have to like her,  she said.  You don t have to like her. Watch Oprah below. She apparently couldn t offer her female viewers one concrete reason to vote for Hillary, so instead she focused on reasons to overlook her negatives and vote for her anyhow. Is this really an endorsement that will help Hillary Clinton win with thinking women or will they just use her endorsement to point out to other women that Oprah couldn t even think of one good reason to vote for Hillary other than the obvious argument used for the low information voter she has a vagina.Here s a video of Hillary speaking down to a young reporter in Oprah s beloved Africa. Maybe Oprah s decided that it s okay for women in positions of power to talk to women like this, as long as you don t invite them over for dinner:",0
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s navy is supplying fuel to U.S. ballistic missile defense (BMD) ships in the Sea of Japan, in a sign of deepening co-operation between the allies amid the growing threat from North Korea, a source said. By providing fuel to the U.S. Aegis destroyers as well as its own BMD ships, Japan hopes to ensure patrols can be maintained without unnecessary gaps, said the source, who has knowledge of the operation. The refueling began in April, the Nikkei financial daily reported earlier. North Korea threatened on Thursday to sink Japan with nuclear weapons for  dancing to the tune  of the United States for backing a U.N. Security Council resolution that imposed fresh sanctions on Pyongyang. The U.S. Navy s Seventh Fleet usually has around six Aegis ships assigned to BMD operations around Japan. Japan operates four ships of its own. They are armed with interceptors designed to shoot down warheads in space before they plunge to their targets. Around half of the ships would normally be at sea at any one time. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s administration in 2015 won lawmaker approval to expand the role of the nation s Self Defence Forces (SDF) under the pacifist constitution to allow them to take on a bigger role in the alliance with Washington, including resupplying and defending U.S. ships. Japan has delivered fuel to U.S. ships in the past under ad hoc legislation, including vessels deployed to support military operations in Afghanistan a decade ago. But this is the first time it has been undertaken under the new security law. Japan s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga at his regular morning press briefing on Thursday said that this kind of co-operation would be undertaken by the allies. He declined to comment on the Aegis ship fuel shipments saying  it could reveal details of SDF and U.S. Navy operations.  ",1
"Make it STOP! Every day another truth is revealed about something Obama or the Obama administration has done to put the citizens of the United States in danger. These stories are so incredible it makes every thinking American wonder how they can be true. More importantly, how can this be happening and no one in America is able to stop it? This is one of those stories The Obama administration is withholding from Congress and the American people detailed information about more than 86,000 illegal aliens who have committed serious crimes and continue to walk the streets in the United States, according to conversations with a member of Congress, who disclosed to the Washington Free Beacon that  if the public knew about this there would be total absolute outrage  over the matter.Rep. Brian Babin (R., Texas) told the Free Beacon that the administration is trying to suppress information about the release of some 86,000 criminal illegal immigrants who have committed 231,000 crimes in just the past two and a half years.Babin, who is spearheading new legislation to boost the deportation rate of these criminals, many of whom continue to walk free across America, warned that the administration is not taking action to deport these criminal illegal immigrants once they are freed from U.S. prisons. All I can think of is they don t want the general public to know what s going on,  Babin said in an interview.  When you have 86,000 criminal aliens committing 231,000 crimes just over the last two and half years, I don t think they want the public to know what s going on. I think if the public knew about this there would be total absolute outrage,  Babin said.  I talk to some of these victims families, it s just incredible to see what has happened and the fact these people served time for felonies, they re released from prison, they re illegally here, and then not being deported, so they go back to their life of crime. Babin said that he has not  had any briefings by the administration  on the matter. My briefings are coming from the victims  families or the victims themselves of these people who are being released and are criminal aliens here,  he said.  Some of these stories are absolutely tragic. Babin is the author of legislation that would halt travel visas and U.S. foreign aid to any country that refuses to take back its citizens.The bill comes as the Obama administration has deported a very small number of illegal immigrants from the United States.The Immigration and Customs Enforcement bureau deported nearly 410,000 aliens in 2012 when it received roughly $2.8 billion in taxpayer funds. The agency expelled just 235,413 aliens in 2015 but received around $3.5 billion to fund its deportation programs, according to the DHS statistics.Deportations have dropped by 174,436 over the past three years despite an increase in funding totaling more than $680 million, according to the statistics.Separate statistics issued by the Department of Homeland Security reveal that the administration deported less than 1 percent of foreigners who illegally overstayed their travel visas to the United States.Babin compared the situation to a similar controversy over the administration s plan to bring in more than 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year. Congressional critics of the plan have warned that federal authorities do not have the capability to properly vet these individuals for ties to terrorism. It s kind of like our refugee situation,  Babin said.  It s very, very difficult to get information about how these refugees are brought into our country and settled around into localities without the knowledge of the local citizens. When U.S. cities do finally learn about these refugees,  they have really no authority to stop it or even slow it down. All you can think of is that the administration really is not too wild about the American citizens finding out about how these things operate. At least 179,029 criminal illegal aliens who have been ordered deported from the United States continue to roam free, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee.The Free Beacon disclosed in August 2015 that the administration had been keeping the release of violent illegal immigrants a secret from U.S. towns.",0
"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireHas political reality finally set in for the GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump?With only days before the Republican Party s National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, presidential candidate Donald J. Trump finally abandoned any pretence of  neutrality  on the Israel-Palestine issue, and is now firmly  committed  to supporting Israeli settlement expansion on territories it has seized illegally, and also not recognizing a Palestinian State.After all the promising rhetoric and previous displays of good will on this crucial foreign policy issue, exactly how did he finally arrive back at the status quo?What started off as interesting, became promising, before eventually settling into Washington s default position. On numerous past occasions during the GOP debate cycle and along the campaign trail, Trump had stated his feelings (which appeared to have an air of passion at the time) and intentions to secure a peace deal for the open-ended Israel-Palestine conflict.The Israeli Lobby started to get very interested in the beginning of December 2015, when during an interview with the AP, Trump seemed to blame Israel for not securing a lasting peace agreement. I have a real question as to whether or not both sides want to make it,  Trump said, before explaining that his concerns predominantly reside with  one side in particular [Israel].  He also hinted that he wasn t interested in any Jewish Republican money, to a chorus of boos he crowed,  I can t be bought . The same for any outside money too. Later, it slipped out again during a nationally televised GOP debate, with Trump making sounds about  negotiating a peace deal. Now here was a true maverick, giving chase to the forbidden cow. Amid all of Trump s wild gaffes and ad hominem attacks, this was an epiphany. At this moment Trump really stood out, and caught the attention   and support   of a whole new legion of disaffected, disenfranchised moderates paddling on the fringe of the Trump wave.That was it. Soon after the phone rang. It was Sheldon.The Donald had been summoned to a one-on-one in Las Vegas with the capo de capo himself, the George Soros of American right-wing politics, the kingmaker, Lord of the Slots and Supreme Master of Macau, billionaire property, casino tycoon and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, 82 yr old Sheldon Adelson. It was after this time that Trump began to shape-shift on the issue, and not in favor of the Palestinians either.  CAPO de CAPO? Donald Trump and Sheldon AdelsonAdelson, a committed Zionist who has backed numerous successful political careers, including that of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, commented on his meeting with the Republican candidate,  He [Trump] had talked about potentially dividing about Jerusalem and Israel, so I talked about Israel because with our newspaper, my wife being Israeli, we are the few who know more about Israel than people who don t. From that point on, began the process of Trump s  rehabilitation  on the Israel-Palestine.On March 10, 2016, there stood Trump, still as the presumptive underdog, at CNN s GOP Debate in Miami   alongside a wall of Republicans candidates who were all firmly in the pockets of the Israel lobby including their emissaries in the US Senate   Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Trump s remarks on the illusive peace process could have been considered seminal way back then: I would like to at least have the other side think I m somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Campaign rival Cruz hit back, questioning Trump s support for Israel saying,  I don t think we need a commander in chief who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel. Everyone, including the media, seemed so shocked by Trump s unorthodox comments that they went near catatonic on this issue afterwords. It was as if Trump had pole-vaulted over the perennial swamp that is the GOP foreign policy platform. The Lobby didn t waste any time however. In the eyes of the wider Israeli Lobby, taking a  neutral  stance or daring to recognize Palestine or Palestinians, is synonymous with attacking Israel and Jews. This is a simple law of political physics in America at the moment and will remain so as long as the lobbyists continue shoveling millions of dollars per month into the pockets of both prospective candidates and elected officials nationwide.Predictably, he was attacked viciously by his opponents, especially Cruz. It seemed as if Trump has broken ranks in a way that was unfathomable for any Republican politician seeking office in the United States of America.Of course, the Israeli press didn t take kindly to Trump s vision of peace and harmony, and from this point onward, pressure began to mount on Trump to conform to the American political orthodoxy on this issue.Soon, Trump was summoned on March 21st, to AIPAC, the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, where he delivered a resounding speech which seemed good enough for the lobby that night, but the job wasn t finished just yet.Later on in May, Trump continued to evolve, now employing doublespeak on the issue, saying he would still like to negotiate  a deal  but that Israel should keep building illegal settlements in the West Bank of Palestine, and that Israel needs to  keep going  and  keep moving forward.  He stated: I d love to negotiate peace. I think that, to me, is the all-time negotiation I would love to see if peace could be negotiated. A lot of people say that s not a deal that s possible. But I mean lasting peace, not a peace that lasts for two weeks and they start launching missiles again. So we ll see what happens. I think Israel should have   they really have to keep going. They have to keep moving forward [with constructing illegal settlements]. Finally, the penny ultimately dropped. With the GOP s Big Tent event rapidly approaching, Trump s platform on Israel has been fully baked. Sputnik News reports: David M. Friedman, a real-estate attorney serving as Trump s main advisor on Israel, said the Republican presidential candidate and reality television star would not support the recognition of the Palestinian state without  the approval of the Israelis.  Friedman also remarked that Trump was unconcerned with the inhabitants of the West Bank, because  nobody really knows how many Palestinians live there. Trump made Friedman a part of his campaign staff in April, at a meeting with Orthodox Jews, naming him and Jason Greenblatt, another real-estate lawyer and Trump s chief attorney, as his advisors on Israel. Friedman said at the time,  Mr. Trump s confidence is very flattering. My views on Israel are well known, and I would advise him in a manner consistent with those views. America s geopolitical interests are best served by a strong and secure Israel, with Jerusalem as its undivided capital.  Friedman has made no secret of his feelings about a two-state solution with Palestine, writing that,  It was never a solution, just an illusion that served both the US and the Arabs. Another devastating blow to the native Palestinians, currently under military occupation   and backed by the US to the tune of $3 billion per year in direct military aid (free money for weapons and equipment).Against his former declarations to the contrary, Trump is also now accepting outside money, from multiple sources. Funny how the political poles shift. How quickly a raging populist becomes a cynical realist. Even for a self-made billionaire, money still buys friends and influence.With that out of the way, it s finally safe for the lobby to get behind Donald in a general election, should they wish to.There it is.

"Donald Trump s  Second Amendment  threat just took a more frightening turn.National outrage ensued after the Republican nominee suggested on Tuesday that gun owners do something to stop Hillary Clinton from nominating judges to the Supreme Court. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,  Trump said.  Although the Second Amendment people   maybe there is, I don t know. This statement prompted the Secret Service to take the unprecedented step of responding to an assassination threat by a presidential candidate against an opposing candidate, whom the Secret Service is charged with protecting and would be in the line of fire should a right-wing gun nut answer Trump s dog whistle.And it appears that at least one gun nut is interpreting Trump s dog whistle call as a call for armed insurrection if Hillary Clinton becomes president and doesn t pick who they want her to pick as a Supreme Court Justice.Greg from Michigan called into C-SPAN on Wednesday morning and while he denied that Trump was calling for Hillary to be shot and killed he frighteningly declared that Trump was actually calling for a bloody armed revolt if conservatives don t get their way. Number one, Mr. Trump was not threatening assassination of Hillary. But what he was implying and could happen is if Hillary got her way and did do away with Second Amendment rights, there are a lot of us who are gun owners who are going to object to that very strongly. And since we do have firearms, it might if it comes down to it be us having to defend our rights with those guns, just as the revolutionaries did in the Revolutionary War. Here s the video via C-SPAN:Trump s rhetoric just took a scary turn and his supporters are taking him seriously. Republicans have talked about  Second Amendment remedies  before but American voters have been consistent in rejecting candidates who spew such rhetoric. The idea of using guns to force your political agenda on the country is a threat to our democracy and has no place in this country. It s time for voters to once again reject this rhetoric by defeating Trump by a landslide. Republicans need to learn once and for all that threats of gun violence is not a political strategy and is a sure way to lose elections.Featured Image: YouTube",0
"Representative Justin Amash (R-Mich.) thinks that providing disaster relief to the people of Flint, Michigan is unconstitutional (Full Disclosure: Amash is my current representative). Amash is a libertarian, and a Constitutional Originalist. That means that he takes the extreme view that the Constitution should be interpreted as the original framers would have. He s besties with Rand Paul, and a darling of the Tea Party. I have been to many of his speaking events. No matter what the topic is, his supporters mostly only want to know the latest news on Benghazi.Amash s extremist view, that is shared with the likes of Justice Scalia, has led him to be very vocal in his opposition to giving federal assistance to the people of Flint. Here is Amash s reasoning for his opposition: While the U.S. Constitution does not authorize the federal government to intervene in an intrastate matter like this one, the State of Michigan should provide comprehensive assistance to the people of Flint. The residents who were harmed deserve an independent, nonpartisan investigation, and the persons responsible for this crisis must be held accountable. Michigan needs federal assistance. That s the bottom line. It is estimated that it will cost $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system. It is tragic that Republicans can rail against the government, working to dismantle the effectiveness of its apparatus on every level, only to have their failed schemes be bailed out by the government. However, we are the United States. We come together in times of crisis. Man-made, or otherwise. 10 people have already died from legionaries disease, people need help now.There is absolutely no Constitutional argument against providing disaster relief to the people of Flint, outside of the mad imaginings of what these loons think the Constitution is. Fortunately, Amash and similarly minded people in Congress don t have the collective political power to actually prevent disaster relief funds to places that need them.That s why the Hurricane Sandy spending package of $9.7 billion dollars was approved of, despite Amash s and other Republicans votes against the package, in 2013. Yeah, he voted against disaster relief for those hurt by Hurricane Sandy too. At least Amash is consistent in his world view, even if that world view is a complete departure from reality.By Gage Skidmore from Peoria, AZ, United States of America (Justin AmashUploaded by AlbertHerring) [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons",0

"America does not have a king. America is not a monarchy. But Donald Trump apparently thinks otherwise and the American people are NOT happy about it.When President Obama visited England for the first time, he declined the gold-plated carriage the Royal family offered for his use during the state visit, opting instead to ride in a motorcade. The motorcade was not only easier to provide security for, it was less expensive and demonstrated that Obama was truly a man of the people.Donald Trump, however, is demanding that the horse-drawn gold-plated carriage be rolled out for him and that a parade be organized down the Mall to Buckingham Palace in October.Of course, we all know that Trump is NOT a man of the people no matter how much he makes that claim. After all, we re talking about a man who continues to live in a gold-plated penthouse in Trump Tower.Trump literally thinks he s a f*cking king and he is demanding to be treated like one even though the Constitution makes it clear that such titles of nobility are not recognized in this country.The cost of security is going to be massive and it s the American taxpayers who are going to be picking up the tab.As news of Trump s ridiculous demand spread, Americans took to Twitter to virtually tar and feather him in the public square of social media.While enjoying the spoils of stealing an election, The Trump Royal Crime Family requests a gold-plated carriage ride with the Royal Family. https://t.co/uRSrPoULCD  UNITE & FIGHT (@stopthenutjob) April 15, 2017@kurteichenwald They should give Trump his ride on gold carriage   off a cliff.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will demand on Thursday that North Korea end its nuclear and ballistic weapons program, according to the draft final statement of an EU summit. The statement, to be delivered after a discussion among leaders on Thursday evening, will follow the latest EU sanctions agreed on Monday by foreign ministers, which go beyond United Nations measures. Leaders will tell Pyongyang  to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner , the draft said. Leaders will also say they are ready to consider further measures, without specifying what they might be. Diplomats said they could include sanctions on non-EU countries still doing business with Pyongyang. Among other steps, the European Union has now banned the sale of oil and oil products to North Korea, although that is largely symbolic, aimed at encouraging countries that have more significant levels of trade with the country to follow suit. China and Russia have resisted an outright ban on crude exports. The EU has imposed a blanket ban on doing business with North Korea.  ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that the Trump administration’s tax reform plan would produce some “short term issues” when viewed under traditional “static” budget analysis rules. His comments during an interview by International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde suggested that the plan would not be revenue-neutral and would increase deficits in the short term. Mnuchin said that the tax plan would pay for itself when viewed through a “dynamic scoring” analysis, which accounts for the increased tax revenues that would be produced by higher growth prompted by the tax changes. “We’re looking for reforms that will pay for themselves with growth,” Mnuchin said. “Under dynamic scoring, this will pay for itself, under static scoring, there’ll be short term issues.” Mnuchin also said the tax plan would be aimed at helping the middle class to “get more money in their pockets” and would be much simpler. “The tax code is way, way, way too complicated. We want to create a system where the average American can file a tax code on a big postcard,” Mnuchin said. ",1

"It s pretty obvious that the FEC chairwoman is just another political hack for the left. Ann M.

After backing down amid concerns she wanted to regulate political speech, the chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission has renewed talk about targeting campaign and political activities on the internet.Ann M.

She was speaking at a day-long conference hosted by the Brennan Center for Justice, the New York City Campaign Finance Board, and the Committee for Economic Development when she was asked about regulating the internet, Google and Facebook.When the Democrats on the FEC first raised the possibility of regulations, opponents feared they were going to target conservative groups, activities and news sites. A proposal to delve into the issue died in a 3-3 vote.Republican Commissioner Lee E.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday said it would appeal a court order blocking President Donald Trump’s executive order that sought to restrict federal funds for so-called sanctuary cities. U.S. District Judge William Orrick III of San Francisco earlier this year ruled that Trump’s sanctuary cities order was likely unconstitutional and stopped it from taking effect.  Trump issued the order in January, shortly after he was inaugurated, directing that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with U.S. immigration authorities. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce federal immigration laws. Dozens of cities and other local governments, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing “sanctuary” movement. The Trump administration contends local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. California’s Santa Clara County - which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities - sued over Trump’s order, saying it was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. They argued Trump’s order could improperly choke off vast swaths of federal funding for sanctuary cities. ",1

If the town votes for it, can the sign remain? America is, after all, founded on Christianity and is a majority country. The more important point is that while these people are trying to rid us of Christian signs, the Muslim religion is EXPLODING in America. We had 200 Mosques only a decade ago and now we have over 2,000! Our schools are being slowly entrenched with lessons on Islam. Communities are having Muslim Day so you can learn more about being Muslim I could go on but you catch my drift. If we don t fight back now, we re scr*wed!

There s no way in hell we re going to take those signs down,  the mayor said Monday, predicting locals would back that stance.  I think when they find out we received that letter, we ll have total support from the community to keep them.  Foundation Co-President Anne Laurie Gaylor told Danner in a letter last week,  The message assumes a common god, yet imagine the public outrage had the city posted a sign that said,  This is Vishnu s Country.   It is equally inflammatory and inappropriate to post a sign dedicating a city to the god of the bible,  she said, referencing the establishment clause of the First Amendment. The city-owned signs on public property  convey government preference for religion over non-religion,  according to Gaylor, and  sends the message that non-believers are not welcome in the city.   We respect the right of every person in Hondo to practice whatever religion or non-religion, they choose,  he said.  The only problem here is that it s the government endorsing religion, rather than private entities. Via: mysanantonio.com",0
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kanye West, one of Donald Trump’s biggest celebrity supporters, appeared to have deleted his tweets about his meeting last year with the then U.S. president-elect in which the two discussed multicultural issues. The influential rapper’s handful of Twitter entries from their Dec. 13 meeting at Trump Tower in New York, where West said he had wanted to discuss “bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums and violence in Chicago,” were missing from his account on Monday. After the meeting, West had also tweeted that he felt it  “important to have a direct line of communication with our future president if we truly want change.” West, 39, emerged as one of Trump’s most high-profile supporters during the 2016 election campaign. He made headlines in November when he was booed at a concert for declaring his support for Trump, although he said he had not voted in the presidential election. It was not clear why the Trump tweets had been deleted but the “Jesus Walks” singer has been the target of outrage and sarcasm from fans on social media following the December meeting. West’s representatives did not return requests for comment. Celebrity website TMZ, quoting an unidentified source, said West had deleted the tweets because he was unhappy about Trump’s actions since taking office. These include a ban on travelers to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations and Trump saying he will “send in the Feds” to “fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on” in Chicago due to high crime rates. West was raised in Chicago. ",1

"We ve heard it all before He was such a good boy this has nothing to do with his Muslim faith.  Never mind that he called 9-11 just before the attack and declared his allegiance to ISIS. The gunman who slaughtered at least 50 people after taking party-goers hostage inside a gay club in Orlando had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, according to California congressman Adam Schiff.Schiff, who serves as top Democrat on the House Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN:  What I ve heard from the Department of Homeland Security this morning is that, according to local police, he made a pledge of allegiance to ISIL (ISIS).   He said the shooting was  highly indicative of an ISIL-inspired attack .Schiff added:  [He] was heard praying in a foreign language and I don t know if this was at some point during the course of the shooting but that s what I m hearing, obviously second hand, coming ultimately from local police. Mateen also called 911 shortly before the shooting and swore allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, law enforcement officials told NBC News.Law enforcement sources have identified the shooter, who was wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun, as US citizen Omar Mateen, 29, from Port St. Lucie in Florida.The gunman, who was born to Afghan parents, opened fire on the dance floor inside Pulse night club in the early hours of this morning.At least 50 people were killed and 53 others were injured in the shooting in the deadliest mass shooting in US history. A surgeon at Orlando Regional Medical Center said the death toll was likely to climb.An FBI spokesman said the mass shooting is being investigated as an act of terrorism, adding that they are looking into whether this was an act of domestic or international terror, and if the shooter was a lone wolf.Schiff said in a statement:  This attack is so painfully reminiscent of the terrible attack at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris, and other ISIS-inspired attacks in recent years. The fact that this shooting took place during Ramadan and that ISIS leadership in Raqqa has been urging attacks during this time, that the target was an LGBT night club during Pride, and   if accurate   that according to local law enforcement the shooter declared his allegiance to ISIS, indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism. Whether this attack was also ISIS-directed, remains to be determined. But Mateen s father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News his son became angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami several months ago.  This has nothing to do with religion,  he said.  We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country. They were kissing each other and touching each other and he said,  Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that . And then we were in the men s bathroom and men were kissing each other. Seddique said Mateen had a job in security and attended Indian River State College, as well as having an associates degree in criminal justice.He was a  known quantity  to the FBI and was investigated twice before the mass shooting. A senior law enforcement source told the Daily Beast that Mateen was a person of interest both in 2013 and again in 2014.An investigation was opened into the 29-year-old, but the case was closed when no evidence appeared to warrant further probing. He s a known quantity,  the source said.  He s been on the radar before. Writing on Facebook, Pulse, which described itself as the most prominent gay club in Orlando, urged party-goers to  get out and keep running  as bullets started flying at around 2am local time.Orlando Police Chief John Mina said the suspect exchanged gunfire with an officer working at the club around 2am, then went back inside and took hostages. There were about 320 people inside the club at the time of the shootings and about 100 people were taken hostage.At around 5am authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue the hostages. Nine hero officers used a  controlled explosion  to distract the shooter before fatally shooting him and were able to rescue about 30 hostages who were hiding in the bathroom of the club.Heartbreaking texts were sent to this victims mother:Here are two additional texts that were sent to Mina Justice by her 30 year old son Eddie:A distraught mother is desperately looking for her son:During the gunfire, an officer was shot, but he was saved by his helmet. It was thought that at least one hostage had been locked in a bathroom with gunshot wounds.Watch here:Mayor Buddy Dyer said in a press conference:  Many were saved by the heroic efforts of the men and women of the OPD, the Orange County Sheriffs, Seminal County Sheriff s office.

Twitter accounts which claim to be affiliated to the Islamic State have hailed the shooting, although DailyMail.com cannot confirm whether the terror group was behind the attack.U.S. Rep.

"21st Century Wire says You know that western society is approaching its final hour when animal rights activists start advocating individual animals to be able to sue humans in courts. That s exactly what has happened in the US.We can trace some of this line of thinking back to Cass Sunstein, the radical, liberal progressive technocrat and chief advisor to President Barack Obama (as well as the husband of disastrous UN Ambassador Samantha Power). According to his own writing and public declarations, Sunstein believes that activists should be able to bring a lawsuit on behalf of an animal in US courts. In his 2004 book Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions, Sunstein remarked:Cass Sunstein. My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law. I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law. As one of liberal America s most influential technocrats, Sunstein argues that this legal right can be invoked on the basis of animal cruelty. While no cruelty seems to be present in the case of the Monkey Selfie (see story below), activists at PETA were no doubt emboldened by Sunstein and others who have propelled their ideological argument into the political activist discourse.While our society and our legal system are far from perfect, a move like this from a wealthy charity like PETA could throw that system into even further chaos.Surely, if animals can sue humans, then shouldn t humans be able to sue animals? As you can see, when you pursue this activist rabbit hole, reality starts to dissolve rather quickly.More on this incredible story from AP Monkey Selfie    Copyright credited to David J.

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar must do more to protect construction workers from heat which often reaches levels that are potentially fatal, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday. HRW and other rights campaigners are frequent critics of Qatar s treatment of migrant laborers whose working conditions have received additional scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2022 World Cup. The group said existing regulations only set limits on outdoor work during the period June 15 to Aug. 31, and then only from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.   Climate data shows that weather conditions in Qatar outside those hours and dates frequently reach levels that can result in potentially fatal heat-related illnesses in the absence of appropriate rest,  it said. HRW called authorities also to investigate the causes of migrant worker deaths and publish data on such incidents. In 2013, health authorities reported 520 deaths of workers from Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, HRW said.  Like other wealthy Gulf Arab states, Qatar relies on vast numbers of migrant workers, mostly from the Philippines, South Asia and Africa. Around 2 million migrant workers live in Qatar, outnumbering the local workforce by nearly 20 to one. Some 800,000 work in the construction sector. Unions and labor protests are banned and authorities penalize dissent with jail or deportation. The Qatari government s Communications Office said:  Qatar is committed to its labor reform program and is constantly reviewing its policies to ensure that migrant workers receive the necessary on-site protections.  We continue to coordinate closely with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and international NGOs to implement reforms that will improve the health, safety and rights of migrant workers,  Sheikh Saif Al Thani, head of the Communications Office, said in a statement sent to Reuters.

"About 14,000 Genesee County voters were mailed a second absentee ballot this month after officials discovered deformities and irregularities in an initial printing run that made many ballots unreadable by voting machines.A mass reprint ordered by Genesee County Clerk John Gleason has prompted the state to step in with guidance on how to minimize voter confusion and ensure that each vote will count   but not twice. Everything is on track now,  said Gleason, a Democrat.  There was a lot of thought that went into this process, a lot of discussion and good dialogue, and I think the recovery happened really fast for what the situation was. The Genesee County ballot snafu comes as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump continues to raise concerns about potential voter fraud and has refused to say whether he will honor the results of the Nov. 8 election if he loses.Trump may find fodder for his  reckless  accusations in Genesee County, said former Flushing Mayor Archie Bailey, a Democrat who argued in an online newsletter that the county s election system  is not rigged  but  bungled beyond belief. Gleason blames the faulty ballots on  a sloppy job  by the company that printed them, which he has declined to name. He said many ballots were skewed, not centered properly, smudged, flecked or had other problems. But election clerks in 22 municipalities had already sent those ballots to voters. Those who received them have since been mailed a replacement ballot, identified by a green number at the bottom.The first batch of ballots were not sent to voters in Flint or Burton, the county s largest cities, which  saved a lot of confusion in those communities,  Gleason said.Local clerks in affected municipalities will likely have a long night on Nov. 8.Under a process recommended by the Michigan Bureau of Elections, returned replacement ballots will be processed as usual after polls close at 8 p.m. while the corresponding originals will be marked as spoiled. If a voter returns only an original, clerks and their staff will duplicate those votes onto new ballots that can then be fed into a voting machine. It s a tremendous amount of work,  Gleason said.  It s routine work, but it s enhanced this year because of the complete reprinting. Mistakes should have been caughtGleason and Genesee County should have discovered the printing flaws before they sent any absentee ballots to local clerks, said Bailey, who previously served on the county board of commissioners.He predicted  a whole lot  of losing candidates are going to challenge Genesee County results in the wake of the Nov. 8 election.Read more: Detroit News",0
"TOKYO/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States is not ruling out the eventual possibility of direct talks with North Korea, Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said on Tuesday, hours after Pyongyang warned nuclear war might break out at any moment. Talks between the adversaries have long been urged by China in particular, but Washington and its ally Japan have been reluctant to sit down at the table while Pyongyang continues to pursue a goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States.  Eventually, we don t rule out the possibility of course of direct talks,  Sullivan said in Tokyo after talks with his Japanese counterpart.   Our focus is on diplomacy to solve this problem that is presented by the DPRK. We must, however, with our allies, Japan and South Korea and elsewhere, be prepared for the worst, should diplomacy fail,  he said. DPRK stands for North Korea s official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert highlighted U.S. diplomatic efforts by Sullivan and others to pressure North Korea to give up its weapons programmes by  encouraging implementation of international sanctions. Nauert told a regular briefing that sanctions were choking off money supply to North Korea and it was feeling the effect,  but even so Pyongyang was  not showing that they are anywhere near desiring to have talks.   We hope that this diplomatic approach will be successful in the end,  Nauert said, while adding of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson:  He s got to be the most optimistic guy in the U.S. government.  Tension has soared following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Leaflets, apparently from North Korea, calling Trump a  mad dog  and depicting gruesome images of him have turned up across central Seoul, adding an unusually personal element to North Korean propaganda.  The situation on the Korean peninsula where the attention of the whole world is focused has reached the touch-and-go point and a nuclear war may break out any moment,  North Korea s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Kim In Ryong told a U.N. General Assembly committee on Monday.  As long as one does not take part in the U.S. military actions against the DPRK (North Korea), we have no intention to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any other country,  according to Kim s prepared remarks for the discussion on nuclear weapons. Kim did not read that section out loud. South Korea and the United States began week-long joint naval drills in the waters around the Korean peninsula on Monday, involving about 40 ships from both militaries, including the nuclear-powered USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, South Korea s defense ministry said. North Korean state media said on Tuesday the allies   desperate efforts  to block North Korea s advance only showed  it should continue its nuclear program  to the last.    The DPRK has been fully ready for all the U.S. is resorting to, including sanctions, pressure and military option, as it has the tremendous nuclear force for self-defence and irresistible strength of self-reliance and self-development,  the official KCNA news agency said in a commentary. Asked about the North Korean envoy s warning of nuclear war, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said it would not be in anyone s interest.  China still hopes that all parties, in this situation where things on the Korean peninsula are highly complex and sensitive, can exercise restraint and do more to benefit the lowering of tensions in the region,  Lu told a daily news briefing. The U.N. Security Council has ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes since 2006.  The most recent U.N. sanctions banned exports of coal, iron ore and seafood, aimed at cutting off a third of the North s total annual exports of $3 billion. Experts say North Korea has been scrambling to find alternative sources of hard currency to keep its economy afloat and advance its weapons program.  On Monday, the head of cyber-intelligence at BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) said North Korea s Lazarus hacking group was probably responsible for a recent cyber heist in Taiwan. Taiwan s Central News Agency said last week that hackers had sought to steal some $60 million from the Far Eastern Bank, but it had recovered all but $500,000. BAE Systems and others have previously linked Lazarus to an $81-million cyber heist at Bangladesh s central bank last year. North Korea has recently allowed citizens as young as 12 to bet on horse races for the first time as the country scrambles to unearth new sources of hard currency amid intensifying international sanctions.  Punters had previously risked three years  hard labor for gambling in the tightly controlled state, but the growing importance of private markets means more people have money to spend on leisure, experts said. Lee Sang-keun, a researcher at the Institute of Unification Studies at Seoul s Ewha Womans University, said wealthy North Koreans had to pay for such activities with Chinese or U.S. currency.   Many North Koreans make lots of money from the market, dine at hamburger restaurants and go shopping, all of which help fatten regime coffers.

"TALLINN (Reuters) - Ireland dismissed British proposals for the Irish border after Brexit as unconvincing on Friday, a day after the EU chief negotiator said they amounted to a demand the bloc suspend its laws for Britain. But British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, speaking at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Tallinn, said a solution was  not beyond the wit of man . The border between the Irish Republic and the British province of Northern Ireland is currently open to free flow of goods, being an internal EU frontier. But when Britain leaves the bloc, it will become subject to EU customs regulation.  Establishment of a physical border could revive security concerns, 20 years after a peace deal involving Dublin that ended a long civil conflict in Northern Ireland and led to the end of army and police checkpoints.     Britain has proposed an  invisible border  without border posts or immigration checks between the two after Brexit, but given no firm proposals how the customs frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic would be monitored. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday British proposals would undermine the bloc s single market. He said Britain in effect wanted the EU to  suspend the application of its laws  as a test case for broader EU-British customs regulations.  This will not happen.  Ireland s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Reuters on Friday:  The maintenance of an invisible border on the island of Ireland would be a lot easier if Britain were to remain in the customs union.  That is something Prime Minister Theresa May has said would not happen, though her cabinet is split on the issue and some have floated the idea of a transition period after Brexit that would still leave Britain in the EU customs union.  Britain is the one leaving, they have an obligation to try and design unique solutions.... We cannot have a physical border on the island of Ireland again that creates barriers between communities,  Coveney said.  We cannot and will not support that and nor will the European Union,  he said, adding that Britons wanted to avoid a hard border too.  The problem is that the solutions to actually get us there so far haven t been convincing.  Negotiations to extricate Britain from the EU have seen a slow start and Brussels has repeatedly warned that time is running out to answer complex questions before Britain is due to leave in March, 2019. The bloc, which will have 27 member states after Brexit, wants to solve key exit issues before opening talks about any future trade cooperation with Britain. London says divorce talks should run in parallel with discussions about future ties.  But, with slow progress on agreeing Britain s divorce bill, ensuring expatriates  rights and deciding on the Irish border, the EU now doubts it will give a green light in October for starting talks about the post-Brexit order, as had been planned.  The EU worries London may try to use the Irish border as a template for a broader trade pact with the EU after Brexit. It believes Britain s proposals risk affecting the bloc s single market and customs union. The European Parliament s chief Brexit speaker, Guy Verhofstadt, dismissed Britain s plans for an  invisible border  as surreal.  We are nowhere on border issues,  one senior EU official said. But, asked if he was confident that Britain would get a deal with the EU, Johnson said in Tallinn:  Absolutely, with rock solid confidence.  He reiterated London s stance that the divorce talks should run together with discussion about the post-Brexit relationship.   Article 50 makes it very clear that the discussion about the exit of a country must be taken in context with discussion of the future arrangements. And that s what we re going to do,  he said. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander, chairman of the health committee, said on Tuesday he will hold hearings in the next few weeks on how to stabilize the individual health insurance market.

"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron told U.S. President Donald Trump that the Paris climate deal could not be renegotiated and that while France would continue to work with Washington, it would no longer discuss climate issues with the United States, a French source said.  “The president spoke with President Trump in a five-minute phone call. The exchange was direct,” a source close to Macron said. “The president said that they could continue to talk, but indicated that nothing was renegotiable with regard to the Paris accords. The United States and France will continue to work together, but not on the subject of climate,” the source added.  ",1

" Andre Vltchek Anti DiplomaticoThe following is an interview with ANDRE VLTCHEK by ALESSANDRO BIANCCHI, Chief Editor of the Italian political magazine Anti-Diplomatico:ALESSANDRO BIANCHI: Self-determination of peoples and respect for the borders and sovereignty of a country. This is of the most complicated issue for international law. How can it be articulated for the case of Catalonia?ANDRE VLTCHEK: Personally, I m not very enthusiastic about smaller nations forming their own states, particularly those in the West, where they would, after gaining  independence , remain in the alliances that are oppressing and plundering the entire world: like NATO or the European Union.Clearly, the breaking of the great country of Yugoslavia into small pieces was a hostile, evil design by the West, and particularly of Germany and Austria. The dissolution of Czechoslovakia after the so-called  Velvet Revolution  was a total idiocy.But Catalonia (or Basque Country), if it became independent, would become one of the richest parts of Europe. I don t think it would have any great positive or negative impact on the rest of the world. As an internationalist, I don t really care if they are separate from Spain or not, or whether they are even richer than they already are, as I care much more about what is happening in places such as Afghanistan, Venezuela or North Korea.On the other hand, the way Spain has now behaved in Catalonia, after the referendum, is a total disgrace. They decided to treat the Catalan people in the same way as Indonesians have been treating Papuans for decades. If this continues, it will all reach the point of no return: reconciliation will become impossible. You cannot start sexually harassing women and then break their fingers, one by one, just because they want to have their own state. You cannot injure hundreds of innocent people, who simply don t want to be governed from Madrid. That s absurd and thoroughly sick! Of course Spain used to commit holocausts all over what is now called Latin America, so it is  in their blood . But I don t think Catalans will allow this to be done to them.What about the constitution of Spain? Look, there should be nothing sacred about constitutions. In the West, they were written to protect the interests of the ruling classes. When they get outdated, they should be moderated, or totally rewritten. If Catalans or Basques want their independence, if they really want it, if it is so important for them, then why not   they should have it. Spain is not a  people s country . It is an oppressive Western bully. I would have a totally different position if some part of Bolivia or China were to try to secede.AB: Different situation and different reality. Another issue of fundamental international concern in this period is the referendum of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is likely to become the new fuse ready to explode in that area. Would it be the new Israel in the Middle East as someone has affirmed?AV: Well, that is really a very serious issue. I have worked in the Kurdish autonomous region of Iraq already twice, even on the  border  with Mosul, and what I saw there I did not like at all!It is clearly a  client  state of the West, of Turkey and to some extent, Israel. It is shamelessly capitalist, taking land from its own people, cheating them, just in order to pump and refine huge quantities of oil. It treats Syrian refugees like animals, forcing them to make anti-Assad statements. It is turning ancient Erbil into some bizarre shopping mall with nothing public in sight. Its military top brass is mainly US/UK-trained and indoctrinated. And it provokes Baghdad, day and night.I really strongly disliked what I saw there. If Iraqi Kurds were allowed to have their  independence , the impact on the region would be huge and certainly negative. Baghdad should not allow it, even at the cost of an armed confrontation.AB: Coming to the question of the moment: the nuclear escalation in North Korean and a possible escalation of war on the Korean peninsula. What is your opinion about Kim s strategy and what are the real risks?AV: There is only one real  risk  and danger: that the world is quickly accepting as inevitable the fact that the Western thuggish regimes can get away with absolutely anything. I see no other serious problem that the world today is facing.What is Kim s strategy? To defend his people by all means, against the brutal force that has already murdered millions of men, women and children of Korea. That brutal force is the West and its allies. It is all very simple, but only if one is willing to turn off the BBC and to use his or her own brain, it becomes  obvious .AB: According to many, for Pyongyang the nuclear bomb is becoming more and more vital because it is increasingly feared that the country will end up like Iraq and Libya. Do you not believe that the sanctions of the United Nations are therefore totally ineffective and counterproductive because they fuel this escalation?AV: Of course, but they [sanctions] are still imposed on the victim! It is because almost no one dares to laugh straight in the faces of Western demagogues and dictators. The world resembles the areas occupied by the Nazi Germany and Italy and Japan during the WWII. There, nobody would dare to vote independently, defending victims of fascism.AB: The US Federation of Science (FAS) estimates that in 2017 North Korea has  fissile material to potentially produce 10 to 20 nuclear warheads  even if it is strongly suspected that none can be considered ready for launch. The US possesses 6,800 nuclear heads. The French and British (respectively 300 and 215 respectively) included, NATO s nuclear forces have 7,315 nuclear warheads, of which 2,200 are ready to launch, compared to 7,000 held by the Russians, of which 1,950 are ready to launch. With Chinese (270), Pakistani (120-130), Indian (110-120) and Israeli (80), the total number of nuclear warheads is estimated to be around 15,000 by default. The West is a nuclear oligopoly that can only create an escalation with those who feel threatened, and so the threatened search to procure them. Is North Korea the only source of nuclear threat to the world, as it seems in the mainstream media?AV: Of course, North Korea is no threat at all. I have already spoken about it during countless televised interviews. I visited North Korea and mingled with its people. There, nobody wants war. The North Korean people paid a terrible price for their independence. Its civilians were murdered mercilessly in tunnels by Western forces; its women were brutally raped, entire villages and towns leveled to the ground, or burned to ashes. All this is never discussed in the West, but is remembered in North Korea.Now, absolutely shameless British propaganda is  preparing  the world public for the  inevitability  of the war. You know, if someone in this day and age still believes that the United States is the only culprit, he or she is perhaps living in some deep isolated trench or a cave. Indoctrination and brainwashing is mainly designed,  Made in Europe , most evidently in the UK, where most of the people have already lost all their ability to think rationally. The British colonialist propaganda apparatus is terribly sinister, but strategically it is simply brilliant! It was utilized for centuries, and it even succeeded in  programming  the brains of the victims in the sub-Continent, Africa and elsewhere.Of course, your numbers are correct and all that is happening is thoroughly absurd! But day and night people are told that North Korea represents a true danger to the world. The same was said about the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan and many other countries. Most of these countries have already been destroyed.North Korea s sin is that it refuses to surrender, to fall on its knees, to sacrifice its people. It refuses to become a slave. For centuries, European and later US colonialism punished such defiance in the most brutal ways. Western culture is, after all, based and built on slavery. It demands absolute compliance, unconditional submission.If North Korea is attacked, it should fight back! And it will.AB: The United Nations adopted the important Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in July. The United Nations is often used (in alternate ways and countries): this Treaty is ignored by all nuclear powers, including by members of NATO with US nuclear weapons (including Italy). NATO has banned member states from ratifying it. Can the West have a moralist attitude to those who pursue a deterrent in order not to not end up like Saddam and Gaddafi?AV: The West is like an army of brigands that has managed to overrun some city, to rape everything that moves, burn the center, loot houses and shops and then execute all leading thinkers and defenders. A few days later they see someone stealing a bunch of bananas from a fruit stall. And they catch him, and judge him, and feel totally morally righteous. It is all so comical! But that is not how you are supposed to see it!AB: Russia and China (with Iran, Venezuela and many other countries) are intensifying de-dollarization in their mutual exchanges. Does it envisage a gradual weakening of the dollar capable of affecting international finance and what geopolitical repercussions?AV: Yes, definitely! And you should talk about it to my friend, Peter Koenig, a true dissident, a former economist at the World Bank, who is now actually advising many countries on de-dollarization.US dollars should not be used anymore. Western institutions should be ignored. Totally new structures should be, and are being erected. China and Russia are, of course, in the lead. All this is extremely important and can change the world, in the near future.AB: Venezuela, with the convening of the Constituent Assembly, turned off the coup attempts of the opposition. In Brazil Lula is favored in polls, while in Argentina the former President Cristina Fernandez is back in the Senate with strong popular support. So it was not the end of the progressive cycle, as the mainstream has for years stated?AV: Of course it was not the end! The desire of Lain Americans to live in just and egalitarian societies is too strong; it cannot be destroyed overnight.There were some serious setbacks   in Argentina and Brazil. And Venezuela is suffering immensely, battered by its own shameless elites sponsored from abroad. But the country is still standing.In Brazil, Temer is immensely unpopular. His  constitutional coup  will soon backfire. PT will be back, in its old form or in a new one. And it will be much stronger than before. The same goes for Argentina. You see, despite all the media manipulation, propaganda and shameless lies, people are already realizing that they were fooled. They want some decency back, they want socialism and pride and hope! They want true independence.In two weeks from now I m going back to South America. My book of essays is being published by LOM, soon, and LOM is a very important left-wing publishing house in Chile. These days I go back to South America often. It is one of the frontlines, battlegrounds, where people struggle against Western imperialism and its lackeys!These are very important, fascinating times!

"VIENNA (Reuters) - A French businessman said he would pay all fines imposed on women wearing a full-face veil in Austria under a law banning it from Oct. 1, an Austrian broadcaster reported. The reported remarks from Rachid Nekkaz, who already pays fines for women who wear Muslim niqabs and burkas despite bans in France and Belgium, provoked criticism from Austria s Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz. The Austrian ban makes public wearing of the Arab-style niqab, which leaves the eyes uncovered, and the Afghan-style burqa, which covers the face with a cloth grid, liable to a fine of 150 euros.  I am reaching out to all women in Europe and especially to women in Austria who voluntarily wear the burqa, I will always be there and pay the fines,  Nekkaz was quoted as saying in a Servus TV interview, which will be aired Thursday evening. If one accepts freedom of religion, one also had to accept a religion s visibility, he said. The property dealer with Algerian roots said he had already spent around 300,000 euros  ($360,000) covering relevant fines. Foreign Minister Kurz, who is the conservative front runner for next month s national election with his People s Party, said Austria would not tolerate symbols aimed at establishing a parallel society.    Whoever wears niqab or burka in Austria has to deal with the consequence,  Kurz said. He threatened to fine Nekkaz if he followed through with his plans. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed new sanctions on five Russians and Chechens, including the head of the Russian republic of Chechnya, for alleged human rights abuses.  The new sanctions blacklisted Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Treasury Department said in a statement.  U.S. authorities accused Kadyrov of overseeing  an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings . On a conference call with reporters Wednesday, a senior U.S. State Department official said that  one or more of Kadyrov s political opponents were killed at his direction.   Kadyrov reacted to news of the sanctions with his usual defiance.  A sleepless night is waiting for me,  Kadyrov wrote, apparently sarcastically, on his Instagram social media account.  I can be proud that I m out of favor with the special services of the USA. In fact, the USA cannot forgive me for dedicating my whole life to the fight against foreign terrorists among which there are bastards of America s special services.  He also wrote that he would not be visiting the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed the sanctions, which freeze the banks accounts of those targeted, under a 2012 law known as the Magnitsky Act.  The Magnitsky Act imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian auditor and whistleblower. The act also seeks to hold responsible those U.S. authorities allege orchestrated or benefited from the death of Magnitsky.   Treasury remains committed to holding accountable those involved in the Sergei Magnitsky affair, including those with a role in the criminal conspiracy and fraud scheme that he uncovered,  Director of the Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control John Smith said in a statement. Magnitsky was arrested and died in a Moscow jail in 2009 after discovering a $230 million tax fraud scheme, according to U.S. authorities. Supporters of Magnitsky say the Russian state murdered him by denying him adequate medical care after he was imprisoned on tax evasion charges. The Kremlin denies the allegation. In addition to Kadyrov and one other Chechen official, the Treasury s action on Wednesday targeted three Russians that U.S. authorities say were involved in the complex tax fraud scheme that Magnitsky exposed. The Magnitsky sanctions have been a point of tension between Moscow and Washington, even before Russia s annexation of Crimea sent relations spiraling. In retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, Putin signed a bill halting U.S. adoptions of Russian children. It had been unclear to sanctions experts whether President Donald Trump s administration, which has signaled a desire to rebuild ties with Moscow, would continue to target people under the law.  The Magnitsky Act attracted greater public attention when it emerged that the president s son Donald Trump Jr., had met with a Russian lawyer and a lobbyist - both strident opponents of the law - in New York ahead of the 2016 U.S. elections. When asked about the June 2016 meeting, Trump Jr. later said they discussed the adoptions issue. On a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, State Department officials said that despite the new sanctions the Trump administration wants a constructive relationship with Moscow.  We believe a Russia that takes care of the human rights of its own citizens will be an even more effective partner,  a senior State Department official said. ",1
"This past January we all witnessed one of the largest, most significant protests in history as millions of people across the globe took part in the Women s March on Washington, but another group has a message for Donald Trump and has quite literally taken it to the next level.Showing support for the upcoming March for Science which will take place on Earth Day, April 22, the Autonomous Space Agency Network, or ASAN, has launched the first ever protest from space. While their protest doesn t physically include millions of people, you can bet that millions are supporting it as we are forced to watch Trump s administration withdraw funding from agencies like NASA s Earth Science program which was put in place to protect our planet from climate change, and don t forget that during Trump s presidential campaign, he vowed to do away with the Environmental Protection Agency, saying,  We re going to get rid of it in almost every form.

"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian opposition leader Kem Sokha has been charged with treason and could face a jail term of 15 to 30 years if convicted, a court said on Tuesday. Kem Sokha was arrested on Sunday in an escalating crackdown on critics of Prime Minister Hun Sen s government, which accused the opposition leader of plotting with the United States to undermine the Southeast Asian country. Trials of senior political figures in recent years have resulted in convictions and international rights groups questioned whether proceedings against Kem Sokha would be fair. He had been charged with  colluding with foreigners  under Article 443 of Cambodia s penal code, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court said in a statement.  The act of secret collusion with foreigners is an act of treason,  it added. The evidence the government has presented is a video of Kem Sokha from 2013 in which he tells supporters of his Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) that he has had American support and advice for his political strategy to win power. One of the opposition leader s lawyers, Pheng Heng, said what appeared in the video clip was no crime.  The legal procedure is wrong and the charge isn t correct,  he said.  What he talked about was elections in a multi-party democratic way.  The arrest of Kem Sokha and growing pressure on independent media and rights groups have drawn condemnation from the United States and other Western countries, which have raised doubts over whether a general election next year can be fair. But Hun Sen, one of Asia s longest serving rulers, has won support from China, which has made him one of its closest regional allies and provided billions of dollars in infrastructure loans. Next year s election could represent the greatest challenge to Hun Sen and his ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP) in the more than three decades he has ruled, but his critics accuse him of trying to shut down all opposition in advance. Pro-government website Fresh News said there could be further arrests of officials from the opposition party in the case.  The government and the ruling CPP have manufactured these treason charges against Kem Sokha for political purposes, aiming to try and knock the political opposition out of the ring before the 2018 electoral contest even begins,  said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch. Kingsley Abott, senior international legal adviser for Southeast Asia at the Geneva-based International Committee of Jurists, said the allegations against Kem Sokha had the hallmarks of being politically motivated.  The absence of an independent and impartial prosecution and judiciary makes the delivery of a fair trial impossible in most political cases,  he said. Kem Sokha, was sentenced to five months in jail last September after failing to appear in court in connection with a case against two of his party colleagues, but he was later pardoned at Hun Sen s request. He had avoided prison on that occasion by taking refuge at his party headquarters. Kem Sokha s predecessor as party leader, Sam Rainsy, was found guilty of defamation in absentia. He lives in France to avoid the conviction, which he says was politically motivated. ",1
"As an American of Polish descent, I am proud to see Poland taking a stand against an invasion of Muslims who seek to forever change the culture and destroy the rich history European nations have enjoyed for centuries. While other European nations sit back and wring their hands over the rape, sodomy and molestation of their citizens, Poland is taking a strong stand by letting the Muslim migrants know, they are not welcome to invade their country.One of Poland s most popular weekly magazines has splashed a graphic depiction of the rape of Europe s women by migrants on its front cover. The image may be one of the most politically incorrect illustrations of the migrant crisis to date.While Poland is generally much more relaxed about expressing itself than the self censoring tendencies of western and northern Europe, the cover of the latest wSieci (The Network) conservative magazine has already prompted reaction just 24 hours after release, being beamed around the continent by social media.Featuring a personification of Europa being pawed at by dark hands   what the German media would perhaps euphemistically term  southern  or  Mediterranean    the headline decries the  Islamic Rape of Europe .Making perfectly clear the intention of the edition, the edition features articles titled  Does Europe Want to Commit Suicide?  and  The Hell of Europe . The news-stand blurb declares:  In the new issue of the weekly Network, a report about what the media and Brussels elite are hiding from the citizens of the European Union .Opening the cover article, Aleksandra Rybinska writes:  The people of old Europe after the events of New Year s Eve in Cologne painfully realised the problems arising from the massive influx of immigrants. The first signs that things were going wrong, however, were there a lot earlier. They were still ignored or were minimised in significance in the name of tolerance and political correctness .Outlining the fundamental differences between eastern Islam and western Christianity    culture, architecture, music, gastronomy, dress    the editorial explains these two worlds have been at war  over the last 14 centuries  and the world is now witnessing a colossal  clash of two civilisations in the countries of old Europe . This clash is brought by Muslims who come to Europe and  carry conflict with the Western world as part of the collective consciousness , as the journalist marks the inevitability of conflict between native Europeans and their new guests.The collapse of the West in the face of this  Islamic rape  was not inevitable though, as Rybinska quoted British historian Arnold Toynbee:  Civilisations die from suicide, not by murder .Via: Breitbart News",0
"Democrats are taking action to keep Donald Trump away from documents related to the investigation of his possible collusion with Russia to steal the presidential election. Following the firing of FBI Director James Comey, top ranking members of the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Justice Department urging the FBI to retain all Russia investigation documents and not share them with the Trump administration. It was brazen, one of the most staggering, stunning acts of a president compromising an investigation,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, said.Trump s decision to fire Comey (the person who just happened to be investigating him) is being compared to Richard Nixon s Saturday Night Massacre and Democrats have called his actions  Nixonian,   mind-boggling  and  a cover-up. If there was any question about the need for a special prosecutor, there is none now,  Blumenthal said. They fired Sally Yates. They fired Preet Bharara. And now they fired Director Comey, the very man leading the investigation. This does not seem to be a coincidence, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Comey was scheduled to testify on Thursday but what will happen now that he is no longer heading up the FBI remains to be seen. I doubt if he ll attend on Thursday but it is still my strong desire to have now-former director Comey to come and testify before the committee,  Sen. Mark Warner said.Comey has indeed been invited to testify as a private citizen, although he has not yet accepted the offer. If he were to do so, and it was a closed-door hearing, he would be free to provide much more information now that he is not the director of the FBI. And this could prove disastrous for Trump.Hopefully, the FBI and the DOJ do as the Democrats are asking and keep these vital documents pertaining to the Russia investigation safe from not only the White House but Attorney General Jeff Sessions as well. Trump and his crooked cronies certainly aren t afraid of trying to make the evidence of their collusion disappear. They are in so deep that they will stop at nothing to escape the inevitable consequences that are coming.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Here are highlights of the Reuters Oval Office interview with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday. ON WHETHER HE WAS AWARE HIS SON DONALD TRUMP JR. WAS MEETING WITH A RUSSIAN LAWYER “No. That I didn’t know. Until a couple of days ago, when I heard about this. No I didn’t know about that.” ON WHETHER HE WISHED HE HAD KNOWN HIS SON WAS HAVING THE MEETING “Look - that campaign ... I actually always thought I’d win, to be honest with you, because I’ve been winning my whole life, to be honest with you, but we started a campaign as a non-politician, and many people were skeptical. Some weren’t, some people who know me weren’t ... but many were skeptical. And it was a wild time. And we would meet with many people.” “That same meeting: a person comes in, sits, leaves, quickly. It was a 20-minute meeting, I guess, from what I’m hearing. Many people, and many political pros, said everybody would do that. If you got a call and said, ‘Listen I have information on Hillary and the DNC,’ or whatever it was they said, most people are going to take that meeting, I think.” “I think many people would have held that meeting.” “And you have to understand, when that took place, this was before Russia fever. There was no Russia fever back then, that was at the beginning of the campaign, more or less. There was no Russia fever.” “Most of the phony politicians who are Democrats who I watched over the last couple of days – most of those phonies that act holier-than-thou, if the same thing happened to them, they would have taken that meeting in a heartbeat.” “First question - first 20, 25 minutes - I said, ‘Did you do it?’ He said, ‘No, I did not, absolutely not.’ I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, ‘Absolutely not.’” “Somebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn’t have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point.” “Look: Something happened and we have to find out what it is, because we can’t allow a thing like that to happen to our election process. So something happened, and we have to find out what it is.” “We have to find out and get to the bottom of what’s going on, because we can’t have even the slightest suspicion about our election process.” “Now, everybody agrees that there was no impact on the votes in this election, which is very important to say, but we have to make sure that nothing could ever happen to our election process.” “Do I feel I can trust anybody, OK? I’m a very suspicious person. I am not a person that goes around trusting lots of people. But he’s the leader of Russia. It is the second most powerful nuclear power on earth. I am the leader of the United States. I love my country. He loves his country. He’s for Russia. President Xi – I had a long meeting with him too, 2-1/2 hours, great relationship. He’s for China, I’m for the United States. They’re for their countries. But I do things the way I do things, and it’s just worked out.” “But we had a very productive meeting. Including the fact that I think we have a good shot at piece by piece getting Syria to stop fighting. Ultimately Ukraine. And other things, including the destruction of terrorists as we know them.” “So I’m sitting with Putin, and we had a very good - we were there two hours and 15 minutes - we had a very good meeting. One of the things brought up was a ceasefire. I said, ‘We’ve got to solve this problem in Syria. And Ukraine by the way.’ And what happened is we sat down and we worked out a ceasefire, which is by the way, as of 20 minutes ago, totally holding, and that’s four days. Four days doesn’t sound like a lot, but they’ve never had a ceasefire that lasted at all. That’s because Putin told them, as opposed to somebody that nobody ever heard of. Putin and I agreed to it, and we have a four-day ceasefire. That means many lives have already been saved because of four days. But it’s going to go on for a while, and things are going to go better.” “I was very tough with President Putin. We have a very important relationship. It’s going to be a relationship where lots of lives could be saved, like as an example with the ceasefire, which nobody else could have gotten but me.” “I campaigned on strong military, strong borders, and low oil prices.” “Look what I’ve done – oil prices have been driven down. We’re sending LNG to Poland, massive shipments to Poland. That’s not what Putin wants. And for the military, we’ve got $56 billion more of equipment than anybody ever thought of, in the last budget. Putin doesn’t want that – so why would Putin want me?” “It’s really the one question I wish I would have asked Putin: Were you actually supporting me?” “I’m very big on energy, and that’s not good for Russia, because Russia makes its money with energy. That drives the price of energy down. I also am very strong on the military, very, very strong on the military. I’m also very strong on cyber.” “I would bet that inwardly Putin would have been against me.” “The mood in the White House is fantastic.” “We have done more in five months than practically any president in history.” “If you look at Iraq and if you look at Syria and you see the progress we’ve made with ISIS, it’s been almost complete.” “The White House is functioning beautifully. The stock market has hit a new high. Job numbers are the best they’ve been in 16 years. We have a Supreme Court judge already confirmed. Energy is doing levels that we’ve never done before. Our military is doing well. We’re knocking the hell out of ISIS, which Obama wasn’t. There’s not a thing that we’re not doing well in. The White House is functioning beautifully, despite the hoax made up by the Democrats.” “The problem is, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t do anything. This isn’t a question of defense. I didn’t do anything. I had no relationship to Russia. So I said, what can the legal team do?” “The only frustration is that this Russia story is a hoax made up by the Democrats as an excuse for losing an election that they should have won because it’s almost impossible for a Republican to win the Electoral College.” “There was zero coordination. It’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. There’s no coordination, this was a hoax, this was made up by the Democrats.” “This is the greatest con job in history, where a party sits down the day after they got their ass kicked, and they say, ‘Huh, what’s our excuse?’” “It just continues and continues, and honestly it’s a disgrace, and it’s very bad for our country. And the Russians must be laughing, because this narrative is so bad for us as a country.”     ",1
"WARSAW (Reuters) - A bill sponsored by Poland s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party will undermine the fairness of elections, opposition deputies said in parliament on Thursday. The proposal would introduce live web feeds from polling stations, but also replace all current members of the State Electoral Commission, a body responsible for conducting and overseeing elections, as well as all election commissioners, giving political parties more say in naming new ones. The PiS has said its bill would make voting more transparent, but critics said the real aim is to boost the electoral prospects of the party, which has been accused by the European Commission of eroding democratic standards.  This bill is a thuggish project. This is a mine placed under elections in Poland,  the head of opposition PSL party, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said in parliament. The socially conservative PiS, in power since late 2015, is already at loggerheads with fellow members of the European Union over its push to bring the courts and state media under more direct government control, as well as over migration. According to the 72-page long amendment that did not undergo any public consultations, seven of the nine members of the State Electoral Commission would be chosen by parliament for 9-year terms, with PiS set to directly appoint three members and the remaining parties four.  The remaining two members would be judges chosen by the head of the Constitutional Tribunal and the Supreme Administrative court.  PiS deputies have already appointed the head of the Tribunal following changes in the law that opposition parties said violated the constitution, a charge PiS denies.  The changes proposed in the bill will destabilize the election system and are a serious threat to the effective carrying out of the local elections in 2018,  the State Election Commission said in a statement last week. Head of the Commission Wojciech Hermelinski said on Thursday the amendment would also give an advantage to political parties at the expense of independent candidates. The bill would require the newly-chosen Commission to appoint nearly 400 election commissioners within 60 days of the bill coming into force, removing the requirement for the commissioners to be independent from political parties. Lawmakers are expected to initially vote on the bill early on Friday. If finally passed by the PiS-dominated parliament, the bill would still have to be signed into law by President Andrzej Duda, who could potentially veto it. ",1
"Donald Trump rang in the New Year by already making a profit from the public office of the presidency, and he still has over two weeks until he is officially sworn in to the office. Trump made the money on New Years  Eve night through a party at his Florida estate/hotel, the very gaudily designed Mar-a-Lago.Unlike pretty much every other elected official, Trump s property charged admission to their event, and the incoming president was dangled like a shiny object in front of the patrons who pulled out their checkbooks to attend this event.According to Politico, Donald Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida charged a reported minimum of $525 per person for a New Year s Eve celebration that Trump and his family were set to attend. On Friday, Trump s incoming White House press secretary told reporters that the party was  sold out,  with over 800 guests expected at the event. That s more than $420,000 made off of dinner, dancing, and access to the incoming President of the United States.Incoming White House Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks attempted to dismiss concern that the Mar-a-Lago s pricy New Year s Eve Party comprised yet another conflict of interest issue for Trump.  The transition is not concerned about the appearance of a conflict,  she told Politico.  This is an annual celebratory event at the private club, like others that have continued to occur since the election. Additionally, the president cannot and does not have a conflict. So far, the mainstream media has simply allowed Trump and his team the leeway to say  there is no conflict of interest,  in a manner that has more in common with Obi-wan Kenobi s Jedi mind trick from Star Wars than a truly responsive political team. But very few people outside of die-hard Trump supporters and his tight inner circle actually believe that this is a credible response to a serious inquiry.Trump and his squad will have to come up with more credible excuses   or, heaven forbid, stop being so crass and unethical   for inquiries to come from Democrats (most of them at least) and the media (maybe). It s  probably a safe bet, though, to assume that his fellow Republicans are perfectly fine with rubber-stamping his behavior as long as he has an (R) behind his name.Trump s behavior on this topic also calls into question his repeated assertion that he is a billionaire ten times over. He infamously refused to reveal his tax returns, and now he says and does anything to scrounge up a few hundred or thousand dollars seemingly everywhere he can. That isn t the behavior of a man with billions at his disposal at the drop of a hat. Is his quest for cash simply another area of vulnerability that will be exploited by either his own party, or by a foreign entity? We won t know, at least not in the immediate future.Featured image via Flickr",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In April 2014, the administration of President Barack Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years, inviting thousands of jailed drug offenders and other convicts to seek early release and urging lawyers across the country to take on their cases. Nearly two years later the program is struggling under a deluge of unprocessed cases, sparking concern within the administration and among justice reform advocates over the fate of what was meant to be legacy-defining achievement for Obama. More than 8,000 cases out of more than 44,000 federal inmates who applied have yet to make it to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for review, lawyers involved in the program told Reuters. That is in addition to about 9,000 cases that are still pending at the DOJ, according to the department’s own figures. Only 187 inmates have had their sentences commuted, far below the thousands expected by justice reform advocates and a tiny fraction of the 2.2 million people behind bars in the United States, which has the world’s highest incarceration rate. The administration said it wanted to decide on all the applications before Obama’s term ends next January, when the program will automatically expire.  A senior DOJ official told Reuters it is calling on the lawyers’ group — Clemency Project 2014 — to simply hand over the outstanding cases without further vetting, saying it is not working fast enough. So far, the group estimates it has handed over around 200 cases. But criminal justice experts say the administration itself should bear much of the blame. The idea to tap pro-bono attorneys to help vet the cases originated with the DOJ, and critics say it should have prepared its own staff to handle the large volume of applications. “It’s unfair to criticize the volunteer group that you asked to help,” said Rachel Barkow, a criminal law professor at New York University who has studied clemency in U.S. prisons. She estimates that about 1,500 prisoners should be eligible for commutation, saying the 187 granted so far does not “fulfill the promise of the program.”  The DOJ declined to comment when asked for its response to such criticism. The delays have left prisoners like Linda Byrnes, 69, in limbo. “I thought clemency was for people like me,” Byrnes told Reuters through an electronic messaging system from a federal prison in Alderson, West Virginia. Byrnes, who has spent 20 years in prison for distributing marijuana and has two years left on her sentence, was recently diagnosed with mouth cancer and has yet to hear whether she has been assigned a lawyer after submitting her application to Clemency Project in August 2014. Obama, who has commuted more sentences than the past five presidents combined, has been a stern critic of harsh U.S. sentencing policies that he says have disproportionately burdened minorities. Federal life sentences have fallen since Obama took office, from 280 in fiscal year 2009 to 153 in 2013, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. About three quarters of the sentences were given to minorities and most were for non-violent offences, the report said. Clemency Project 2014 said it does not comment publicly on the individuals it represents. The group vets the applications, writes the petitions and sends them to the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney, which oversees all pardons and sentence commutations and makes recommendations for the president’s approval.  So far, 25,000 of 34,000 applications received by Clemency Project have been rejected for failing to meet the basic criteria - no record of violence, no significant ties to a gang or drug cartel, good behavior in prison and completion of at least 10 years of sentence. About 10,000 inmates did not go through the Clemency Project and either applied directly to DOJ or through a paid attorney.  “It really would be a sad state of affairs if individuals who had asked for a lawyer weren’t considered in time because their petitions never reached the pardon attorney’s office,” a DOJ official told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. (Graphic on the clemency bottleneck: tmsnrt.rs/1VThxVT) A large number of mostly unqualified applications, a shortage of lawyers and the complexity of the cases have slowed progress, said Cynthia Roseberry, project manager for Clemency Project 2014. “There are a lot of gray areas,” said Roseberry, who estimates it takes 30 days for one lawyer to review one case on average. “We’ve got to unpack each of these applicants to see specifically what factors affect them... and so that takes a little more time.” This includes finding pre-sentencing reports for each case, determining if the person would have received a shorter sentence under current law and reviewing prison behavior records. Roseberry said the group was unaware of any request from the Justice Department to hand over the pending applications. Roseberry said the group’s initially slow pace has picked up in recent months.  The Justice Department declined to elaborate on its private communication with the lawyers. The Pardon Attorney’s office has brought in personnel from other parts of the department to help to speed up reviews of petitions, the DOJ official said. Roseberry said about 3,000 applicants still need to be assigned to a lawyer, and that it was not certain whether the group will be able to submit all of the applications it has received before Obama leaves office.  The group has more than 570 law firms and 30 law schools contributing to the effort. Some rejected prisoners and those who have yet to hear a decision say they believe they would have had a better chance if they had sent their clemency petition directly to the government. Josie Ledezma was sentenced to life for conspiracy to transport cocaine and applied for clemency through Clemency Project 2014. She said she did not hear from them for six months and later learned that her assigned lawyer had shut down her legal practice. In January, nearly one year after applying, she was told Clemency Project 2014 could not help her and encouraged her to apply directly. “I wrote back and asked what was it that made me not qualify, but never got a response,” Ledezma told Reuters through an electronic messaging service for federal prisoners.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s order on financial regulations issued on Friday will require the Treasury secretary to submit a report on potential regulatory and legislative reforms in 120 days, a White House official said. “This does not mean White House or Treasury has to wait 120 days to move,” the official told Reuters. “We have more items planned in the coming weeks and the policy process is already underway in the White House.” ",1
"LILLE, France (Reuters) - A P&O ferry with more than 300 people on board which had run aground in Calais harbor in northern France has been refloated and all passengers have disembarked, a P&O Ferries spokesman said on Sunday.  The Dover-bound  Pride of Kent  had run aground on a sand bank around midday as she tried to leave the Calais harbor in stormy weather. Nobody was injured.  The ship, supported by two tug boats, was refloated as the tide came in early evening and all passengers have disembarked. The spokesman said most passengers would continue their journey to the UK on other P&O ferries tonight, while some would stay overnight in Calais on P&O s expense. UK-based P&O operates 20 ferries which carry nine million passengers per year between France, Belgium, The Netherlands and across the Irish Sea. ",1
"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May refused to say whether she would vote for Brexit if there was another referendum, repeatedly avoiding giving an answer on an issue that will define Britain s fate for generations to come. Although May has talked up the  promise of Brexit  since gaining power last year, she had, in the run-up to the June 2016 referendum, quietly backed staying in the European Union. She won the top job after David Cameron, who had also campaigned to remain, resigned in the chaos following the shock result of the vote. She has ruled out holding a second referendum on the final deal of the terms of Brexit, despite calls for one from some pro-EU lawmakers. Asked three times in an interview if she had changed her mind since then, she did not answer directly, saying she wouldn t engage with hypothetical questions and said her job was now to deliver what the people had voted for.  I voted remain for good reasons at the time, but circumstances move on and I think the important thing now is that I think we should all be focused on delivering Brexit and delivering the best deal,  she said on British radio station LBC on Tuesday. The United Kingdom remains deeply divided over Brexit which most senior politicians view as the most important decision Britain has taken since World War Two. In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 51.9 percent of votes cast, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million voters, or 48.1 percent of votes cast, backed staying. Britain has just over one year to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019. Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world s biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy. But the other 27 members of the EU combined have about five times the economic might of Britain. They also have a strong incentive to deny the UK a deal so attractive it might encourage others to follow the British example.  May, who said she voted to remain, called a general election earlier this year in a bid to unite the country around her vision for Brexit. However, she lost her parliamentary majority, jeopardizing her premiership. Pressed on whether she would now vote leave, she said she would look at everything and come to a judgment, but stressed that there would not be another referendum. Minister Damian Green, who is effectively May s deputy, was asked on BBC Newsnight the same question. He said that it would have been better had the public voted to remain, but there would not be another referendum and it was his job as a democrat to work towards making Brexit a success. Under the headline  Theresa Maybe , The Sun, Britain s most read newspaper, said Brexiteers were offended by May s response. ",1
"RIYADH (Reuters) - White House chief of staff Reince Priebus will not be joining President Donald Trump for his full trip through the Middle East and Europe.  He is returning to Washington after doing only the Saudi Arabia portion of the journey, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. Sanders said Priebus had planned to return early, in particular because the White House is unveiling its full budget this week. Priebus traveled to Saudi Arabia with Trump on Air Force One on Friday. Trump’s White House is battling scandals related to the president’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Rumors of pending staff shake-ups have been rampant almost since Trump took office in January.   ",1

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday appeared skeptical toward a request from several states that want him to order the administration of Republican President Donald Trump to continue payments to health insurers under Obamacare.  At a hearing in San Francisco federal court, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said he aimed to issue a ruling on Tuesday.  The Trump administration earlier this month terminated the payments, which help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans, as part of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.  Trump had threatened to cut off the subsidies for months, prompting health insurers such as Anthem Inc, Humana Inc, UnitedHealth Group Inc and Aetna Inc to raise premiums or exit insurance markets. Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government and asked for an immediate order halting Trump’s move while the case is being litigated and argued that terminating the payments harmed customers by raising insurance rates.  But Chhabria on Monday suggested that California and other states had anticipated Trump’s move and worked with insurers to make sure most consumers would not be harmed. That weakens the case for a court order forcing the payments, Chhabria said.  “Why should I be ordering the administration to make these payments in the next few months while we get the case adjudicated?” Chhabria asked. Since cutting off the payments, Trump has alternately supported, and dismissed, an effort by Republican and Democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years until a broader replacement to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, can be negotiated. While Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging Obamacare, the president argued that the subsidies made insurance companies “rich.”  In a court filing on Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice pointed to a prior ruling from a Washington, D.C. federal court that said Congress had never appropriated the money for the subsidies. An appeal of that ruling is currently on hold. Either side could appeal Chhabria’s ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is weighted with Democratic-appointed judges.  From there, any further appeal would go to the U.S. Supreme Court. ",1
"Big-mouth billionaire and leftist author of the highly successful Harry Potter books, has finally taken responsibility for an awful rumor she started about President Trump and a disabled boy after the disabled boy s mother came out on Facebook to tell the truth about what really happened when President Trump met her disabled son.Author J.K. Rowling issued an apology Monday after falsely accusing President Donald Trump of refusing to shake hands with a disabled boy by sharing an edited video clip on her social media account over the weekend.The boy s mother lashed out at Rowling, saying that the Harry Potter scribe wrongly said Trump ignored and refused to shake her disabled son s hand during a recent meet-and-greet. If someone can please get a message to JK Rowling: Trump didn t snub my son & Monty wasn t even trying to shake his hand,  Ms. Kelly Weer wrote in a post on Facebook, slamming Rowling s inaccurate description of a video showing her son meeting President Trump. 1. He s 3 and hand shaking is not his thing 2. he was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch). Thanks,  Weer wrote.Rowling, a regular critic of the president, blasted Trump and claimed he  deliberately  ignored the boy, Monty Weer, who suffers from spina bifida. Trump imitated a disabled reporter. Now he pretends not to see a child in a wheelchair, as though frightened he might catch his condition,  she tweeted over the weekend. My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it,  Rowling wrote on Twitter.  So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child s head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw. That man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilised norms are having a corrosive effect,  the author continued.  How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President. However, a White House video clearly shows President Trump bending down and graciously greeting his young fan as he approached the podium.Rowling faced intense criticism on social media, with many users urging she delete the series of tweets that included the false claims.Pictures posted on Twitter on June 26th, show Melania hosting the little disabled boy that JK Rowling accused President Trump of ignoring, during a visit to the White House in his wheelchair.

A spokesperson for Rowling apparently refused to confirm to CNN s Oliver Darcy whether or not the author would apologize to Trump. Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proferred hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage,  Rowling wrote.  [M]ultiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction. I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly. These tweets will remain, but I will delete the previous ones on the subject.    Breitbart News ",0
"You know how Trump supporters are screaming because brown people are protesting police violence and discrimination by peacefully kneeling for the National Anthem? Well, a photograph has surfaced that perfectly demonstrates the hypocrisy of the  fornicate with the flag  movement or whatever those screaming about it are calling themselves these days.Trump fans love to wave around their American flags while screaming  America First  but when you look at the respect conservatives actually show for their flag and country, you have to consider having a physician on standby to prevent you from dying of laughter.One right-wing  protester  wearing a shirt that says  I STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM  was captured at a Jets game Sunday casually lounging on the same American flag he waves as he claims he s the biggest patriot in the history of patriotism with his trusty beer next to him.Deadspin reports that the person who snapped the photo saw the spectacle as they were walking with a friend through the stadium during the third quarter of the game. There is a huge tv screen by the food carts right inside the stadium where people gather to watch. We went over there to check it out and we saw him spread the flag out and sit down,  they said.  I thought it was too ironic so I snagged a picture. He sat on it for a few minutes before leaving. This is the reality of the  Patriots  on the Right. They talk a big game whenever they see a rainbow American flag or whenever an an African-American person is kneeling in front of one as the National Anthem plays. But when it comes to respecting the flag   well, you see what happens.Featured image via screengrab",0

"CNN uses their go-to move when they don t like what someone is saying during an interview..they cut you off! A CNN broadcast Saturday cut off an African-American Trump supporter in the middle of answering a question about  white guilt  posed by a reporter.  I have seen one shirt that said  no white guilt,  things like that. I mean, there have been some messages that might not be that open to folks from diverse perspectives. What would your message be to folks like that? Trump supporter Diante Johnson answered,  When it comes to  no white guilt,  I I agree with that, I actually just made a post about it on my page and a video about it There are some White Americans that feel guilty for what their ancestors did, you know, this and that, and the thing about it is, they shouldn t have to feel guilty, this is America  The video was then cut off.The reporter continued,  Certainly, an interesting perspective there from an African-American who supports Donald Trump and is here today. The CNN video comes from coverage of a rally held on the National Mall Saturday.Johnson is president of the Black Conservative Federation.Via: Daily Caller",0
"The Republican nominee just got owned by a fellow billionaire.To begin the Late Show on Wednesday night, Stephen Colbert introduced Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban for a special  Take The Gloves Off  segment.Cuban bragged that he is twice the billionaire that Trump is and then set out to roast him.And Cuban did NOT hold back as he dropped burn after burn with Colbert popping in and out to chime in with his own hilarious quips. Donald, the gloves are off. Speaking of gloves, I got you a pair for your birthday. You re a child s medium, right?  Cuban began. Donald, I ve got a travel tip for you. When you re going through customs and they ask if you ve got anything to declare, try not to blurt out  bankruptcy,  he continued. That s a billionaire bitch slap,  Colbert observed. Your companies fail so often, you must ve gone to business school at Trump University,  Cuban said, to which Colbert replied,  Oh, Donald   he just dropped you like one of your first two wives. Cuban then dropped the hammer on Trump. Donald, do you know that to be a billionaire, you have to have the billion part in your bank account. Not just the air. And finally: Donald, the only way you re worth $10 billion is if I paid you $9.5 billion to wash my balls! Here s the video via YouTube.Cuban went on to explain later in the show that he became a supporter of the #NeverTrump movement because while he initially believed Trump would bring a business perspective to the White House instead of just a typical politician he soon changed his tune after Trump opened his mouth. Plus, Trump is just  lazy. Cuban also joked that Trump is so embarrassing that he and his fellow billionaires voted to kick him out of their club and that they even changed the secret handshake.Featured image via Screenshot",0
"In 1991, when old, white men turned on Anita Hill, a monster was awakened, and that monster was the fury of the woman. In the 1992 election, women let the old boy s club know exactly how it felt   they elected a Democrat for president, and they made unprecedented gains in the House and he Senate. The 1992 election was called the Year of the Woman. And it was all thanks to one woman   Hill   who stood up to the good old boys.And now that the 2016 Democratic Primary is almost over, with Hillary Clinton reaching the threshold to claim victory, women will come out of the woodwork (at an even faster pace) and enact real change.Vox contends that should Clinton win the presidency, just her mere presence in the White House will be enough to spur a growth of women running for office:Clinton s gender is the most obvious way she stands out from everyone who s held the presidency before, but people inside and outside the campaign have hesitated to argue explicitly that it matters. But it does matter. Enormously. A woman president would be   by far   the biggest, most salient, and most important example of a successful woman in American politics likely inspiring secondary and tertiary waves of women s election runs and election victories.Using analysis from political consultant Amelia Showalter, Vox shows that when women are even mentioned as potentially running for office, female involvement in the whole process increases by a percentage point. When a woman is elected as a state Attorney General, participation increases to two percent. When elected Governor, it increases to 2.36 percent. When elected Senator, it increases to 2.9 percent.Should Clinton be elected President of the United States, with the sort of name recognition she has, the amount of female participation in the process (elected and unelected) would increase astronomically. And that measure doesn t include the throngs of women Clinton will choose to fill her cabinet.Analysis also shows that when women have representation (such as the presidency) and their identity politics   abortion, equal pay, childcare   are adequately represented by women, they will cause a ripple effect that will essentially bring male legislators onto their side. As Tali Mendelberg, Christopher Karpowitz, and Nicholas Goedert show:When women are many, they are more likely to voice women s distinctive concerns about children, family, the poor and the needy. What s more, when women are more numerous and therefore more vocal on these topics, men become more vocal too, and these effects are associated with more generosity to the poor.Women, in a sense, could liberalize the country by being elected to office. How do they get elected to office? They are inspired to run. And how are they inspired to run? They see other women, like Hillary Clinton, achieve high office.It s a ripple effect that will usher in the much needed change in Washington. After all, it s been proven that women in Congress, when they are in charge, get more done in a more bipartisan fashion.Hillary Clinton is going to help continue that.Featured image via Kevin Winter",0

"Ahead of tomorrow night s debates, where Hillary will have an abundance of facts, figures, experience and knowledge at her disposal while Trump will only have misogynistic insults and outright lies at his, a Fox host is complaining that television is home to reverse sexism. Why?Because men can t condescend to women on TV, and that s just not fair.Wah wah wah someone bring the guy a tissue before he blows his nose all over the women he s working with. Bill Hemmer was speaking with Jessica Tarlov about the debate, and Tarlov said she feels it s absolutely appropriate for Hillary to criticize Trump s misogyny and racism while onstage. When Tarlov began listing specific examples of Trump being racist and misogynistic, she said,  I could go on, obviously,  to which conservative lobbyist Matt Schlapp said,  You are! Hemmer cut in with: We work in television. And I ve always thought that when a man and a woman is on television, a woman can be sarcastic or even, perhaps, a little condescending toward a man and it s okay. But a man can never do that to a woman and get away with it. Watch below:While Hemmer s logic might sound reasonable on the surface, here s why it s not: Reverse oppression (racism against whites, sexism against men, discrimination against straight, cisgender people, etc.) doesn t exist because oppressors can t suddenly become the oppressed. Oppression, particularly by straight, white, cis, Christian men, is woven into our society. It s insidious. And while yes, men can experience prejudice and stereotype, our society is built by men, for men. Prejudice and stereotype are not the same as oppression.It s not about one person being an asshat to another, which is what Hemmer is really whining about and equates with so-called  reverse sexism.  When Schlapp responded to Tarlov s litany of Trump sins with,  You are!  he was putting her in her place, not arguing her point. That is sexist. That s relegating her and her arguments into the background as irrelevant on the basis of her gender, not the merits of her argument.As a woman, Tarlov can t send a man back into the background because he s not in the background to begin with, as she is. That s just the way it is.Since Hemmer works for Fox Noise, though, it s only natural that he probably won t even attempt to understand this.As far as Trump and the debates, Hillary won t be putting Trump in the  man s place  when she calls him out on his sexism, racism, etc. She can t   but he can try and put her in her place and he does it all the time. She s calling out fundamental flaws in Trump that make him unsuited to lead a country that desperately needs its oppressive structures torn down. He, on the other hand, will build on those very structures.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",0

"FRANCE HAS THE BLOOD OF THIS PRIEST ON THIER HANDS! Their political correctness allowed this KNOWN TERRORIST to roam freely in the streets! Shame on their progressive values that made it possible for this beautiful 84 year old priest, who was filling in at the church to be beheaded by these monsters!  The ISIS knifemen who stormed into a church in Normandy filmed themselves butchering an elderly priest after forcing him to kneel   before they performed a  sermon in Arabic  at the altar, a terrified witness has revealed today.The 84-year-old priest, named as Jacques Hamel, had his throat cut in a Normandy church this morning in an attack that also left a nun critically injured and both jihadis dead.The two killers, who were both known to French authorities, were shot dead by police marksmen as they emerged from the building shouting  Allahu Akbar . The building was later searched for bombs.One of the extremists who stormed into the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray near Rouen during mass was a French 19-year-old named Adel K., who was being monitored by electronic tag after twice attempting to join fanatics in Syria. Unbelievably, his bail terms allowed him to be unsupervised between 8.30am and 12.30pm   the attack happened between 9am and 11am.Adel K is understood to have forced the priest to kneel while his accomplice, who also lived locally and was on a terrorist watchlist, filmed the brutal killing.This afternoon it emerged that the murdered clergyman was deputising while the regular parish priest was on holiday. French authorities say they have arrested a third man over the attack   a 17-year-old man believed known as HB and believed to be a relative of Adel K.It was also revealed that the Catholic church involved was on a terrorist  hit list  found in the apartment of a suspected ISIS extremist last April.Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for a  merciless  response to the killing while  horrified  ex-Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said he feared  everything is being done to trigger a war of religions .France s Socialist president Francois Hollande addresses the Islamic terror attack with the press here: A nun who was in the church during the attack said the priest was forced to the ground before his throat was slit.French authorities admitted that both of the attackers were subject to security  S  files, meaning both were known terror suspects who should have been under surveillance.Adel K. was a convicted terrorist who was meant to be living with his parents in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray with an electronic tag on his ankle.In March 2015, while still a minor, he tried to reach the terror group s base in Syria via Germany, but was arrested in Munich.  He was placed under judicial control with his parents, but after his 18th birthday again tried to return to the Middle East.Accompanied by two childhood friends, Adel K. headed to Switzerland overland and then took a plane to Turkey, hoping to cross the border into Syria.Turkish police deported him back to Switzerland and, after being sent back to his hometown, he was tried and found guilty of  associating with a terrorist enterprise  on May 22 2015.After spending less than a year of his two-and-a-half-year sentence in prison, he was released on March 22 this year.For entire story: Daily Mail ",0
"BERLIN (Reuters) - German and U.S. employers, workers, consumers and farmers would “without doubt” benefit from a free trade deal being negotiated between the European Union and the United States, U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. Their comments were in sharp contrast to those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump who made attacks on international trade deals a cornerstone of his election campaign, saying they have cost U.S. jobs.  “An agreement that links our economies more closely and that builds on rules that comply with our shared values would help us to grow over the coming decades and to remain competitive at the global level,” Obama and Merkel wrote in a joint article for German magazine WirtschaftsWoche. Defying Trump’s protectionist rhetoric, Merkel and Obama said the United States and Germany were stronger if they worked together and stressed that cooperation is now more important than ever before because the global economy is developing more rapidly than ever before while global challenges are developing at the same speed. “There will be no return to a world before globalization,” they wrote, according to an advance extract of their article that is due to be published on Friday. The two leaders added that Germans and Americans needed to take the opportunity to shape the way globalization happens according to their own values and ideas. “We owe it to our companies and our citizens - and in fact to the whole international community - to broaden and deepen our cooperation,” Obama and Merkel said. Given that decisions in one country are felt in other countries, it is crucial to have rules like those being negotiated in the EU-U.S. trade deal called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), Obama and Merkel said. Merkel was the driving force in Europe behind TTIP, which has been under negotiation for more than three years. Brussels and Washington both realize it will not now be completed under Obama’s term as earlier envisaged. “We’re campaigning for international laws and norms around the world to be respected - as a prerequisite for stability and prosperity,” Obama and Merkel wrote.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington criticized President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration on Tuesday, saying they did not want the memories of those killed used to justify harming refugees. Trump last Friday banned travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, leading to protests, confusion and legal challenges. “This is totally unacceptable,” John Sigmund, whose sister, Johanna Sigmund, died inside the World Trade Center in New York on Sept. 11, 2001, told reporters on a conference call. “It goes against everything we stand for as Americans.” The text of the order specifically made reference to the hijacked plane attacks, which killed about 3,000 people. But the relatives who spoke on Tuesday pointed out that none of the Sept. 11 Islamist militant hijackers was from any of the seven countries named in Trump’s order. Trump’s order halted travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and stopped resettlement of refugees for 120 days. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, two from United Arab Emirates and one each from Lebanon and Egypt.  The White House has described the order as necessary “to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.” Sept. 11 family members said Trump’s action would sow mistrust among Muslim Americans and hurt refugees from war-torn countries. Most of the relatives are members of September 11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, a group formed in 2002 that opposed the war in Iraq. “I am actually sickened by President Trump’s use of 9/11 in this executive order,” said Terry McGovern, whose mother was killed at the World Trade Center. “Don’t use our loved ones, and specifically my mother, to turn away refugees.” Not all Sept. 11 families may agree, however. Kathleen Ganci, the widow of a fire department official killed in the attacks, told The New York Times she supported efforts to restrict travel to ensure national security. “There’s many, many fine Muslim people in this world, but there’s many many people who want to kill us, and we need to vet them, and we need to find out,” she was quoted as saying.

"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia rejected on Tuesday a report by an international inquiry blaming the Syrian government for a deadly toxic gas attack, casting doubt on whether the U.N. Security Council can agree to extend the investigation s mandate before it expires next week. Russia vetoed an initial U.S. bid to renew the joint  inquiry by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on Oct. 24, saying it wanted to wait for the release of the investigation s report two days later. It has since proposed its own rival draft resolution, which deputy Russian U.N. Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov said on Tuesday aimed to enhance the effectiveness of the inquiry and correct  errors and systemic problems.   Without a comprehensive change it will become a tool to settle accounts with the Syrian authorities,  Safronkov told the 15-member Security Council on Tuesday during a meeting on the report by the U.N./OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM). The report found the Syrian government was responsible for an April 4 attack using the banned nerve agent sarin in the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, killing dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. The chemical weapons attack prompted a U.S. missile strike just days later against a Syrian air base.  Russia is trying to shoot the messenger to cover up for the crimes of the Syrian regime,  Deputy British U.N. Ambassador Jonathan Allen told the Security Council. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said there could be no higher priority for the Security Council than renewing the JIM mandate. Diplomats said the United States had amended its draft resolution in a bid to win Russian support.  Anyone who prevents us from achieving this goal is aiding and abetting those who have been using chemical weapons,  Haley said.  They are helping to ensure, not just that more women and children will die, but that those women and children will die in one of the cruelest, most painful ways possible.  A resolution must get nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France to pass. Allen told reporters the Russian draft resolution  has very little if any support in the council and no realistic prospects of success.  The JIM had previously found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. ",1

"CJ Pearson, the 12 year old conservative social media sensation who was bullied and threatened by grown-ups on the left, has more class in his little finger than the entire Democrat party combined. Here is a video message to President Barack Obama by CJ Pearson regarding his hatred for America that has over 1 million hits:The woman who launched an online campaign of bullying and veiled threats against Internet sensation CJ Pearson, frightening the young conservative s family enough to drive the boy briefly out of politics late last week, has been identified as a  top Democratic activist  from Baltimore.And the Pearson family is planning to press charges.According to a Facebook posting Sunday by Ali A. Akbar of Vice and Victory, a consulting firm that works with CJ, the woman behind the Twitter account  Mona Hussein Obama  is actually named Mona Brown. What she did was against the law,  Akbar said on the video, vowing to  expose a troll, a bully, a grown adult and top Democrat activist in Maryland for bullying a 12-year-old. Late last week, Brown began her Twitter campaign of harassment against Pearson in retaliation for Internet videos harshly critical of Obama that have made the boy an Internet sensation. Her tweets ranged from insults    your fam has been bowing down to white ppl    to hints of violence  Wish we could switch Trayvon s life for yours. On Facebook Friday, the 12-year-old announced he had had enough. After much thought and consideration, I ve decided to take a break from politics and political commentary,  he wrote.  I had a horribly rough night on Twitter after a woman not only threatened to sue me for expressing my opinions but threatened my family.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday denied a request for Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, to return to the United States to attend a hearing over an unpaid $6 million settlement in an international money laundering case. In an order filed in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said Veselnitskaya’s immigration status was “squarely within the purview of the executive branch.” Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a Russian-controlled company, which in May agreed to pay nearly $6 million to settle a U.S. government lawsuit accusing it of laundering proceeds of a $230 million tax fraud. Her temporary permission from the U.S. Department of Justice to enter the United States while working on the case has expired. Following Pauley’s order on Monday, a U.S. lawyer for Prevezon filed a letter asking that Veselnitskaya be allowed to appear by telephone at the hearing, which is scheduled for Nov. 9. The hearing is expected to focus on whether the settlement payment was due on Oct. 31, as the U.S. government has maintained. Prevezon disputed that in a letter filed on Oct. 31. About half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to Prevezon the Netherlands had frozen at the United States’ request, according to the letter. The Netherlands lifted the freeze on Oct. 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze based on a complaint by William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, Prevezon’s letter said. Browder has said that the underlying $230 million tax fraud was uncovered by a former Hermitage auditor, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison in 2009. In its letter, Prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary U.S. immigration status for Veselnitskaya and its owner, Denis Katsyv, so they could attend hearings. Veselnitskaya met Donald Trump Jr in New York last year. Trump Jr. said in a statement at the time that he and Veselnitskaya “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children” after Russia in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the U.S. Magnitsky Act. The 2012 law was intended to punish Russian officials responsible for Magnitsky’s death. Trump Jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last year’s election that described Veselnitskaya as a Russian government attorney who could provide information that would “incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.” ",1
"Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said there is no doubt in his mind that Donald Trump will go through with banning Muslims from the United States, just like he said he would.Speaking to Variety, Moore said that he has already done his grieving over Trump s win, which he saw coming long before it became a reality. I went through my five stages of grief months and months ago when I realized he was going to win,  he said.Moore said that he has  taken him literally and seriously since day one,  which is why he fully expects Trump to do all the horrible things he said he would on the campaign trail, like building a wall along our southern border to keep out all the rapey Mexicans. You do have to take Trump at his word,  Moore said.  I still hear people say,  Oh, he s not really going to build the wall.  Oh, he is going to build it. He knows that he s got to deliver at least a version of the wall. This, Moore explained, is why he  absolutely  believes Trump will go through with enacting his Muslim ban. He s shown how he s going to do it,  Moore said.  He s going to get away with it by making it a ban on Muslims who come from the following countries. He needs just enough cover for his crowd to say,  Oh, he s being reasonable there. He s not banning all Muslims. Moore also said that he was profoundly affected by Meryl Streep s powerful speech denouncing Trump at the Golden Globes. I had tears in my eyes,  Moore said.  It was so powerfully delivered by the perfect person. She was talking about human empathy. It was not about being a Republican or a Democrat. It was about: Have you no decency, sir? Trump s supporters like to say that they don t take what he says literally. But that is a mistake. As Maya Angelou said,  When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.  We know who Trump is. And we also know it s going to be a long four years.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images For AFI",0

"Absolutely everything about the story of Brock Turner, the convicted Stanford swim team rapist, is gag-worthy. He received a particularly light sentence (more on that in a bit), his father thought he shouldn t have had any sentence because it was just  20 minutes of action.  Now, a friend of Turner has spoken and her (yes her) attitude is that we are being way too politically correct because well, he s in college, or something like that.Apparently, according to Turner s childhood friend, Leslie Rasmussen, a rapist isn t really a rapist when it happens on a college campus: I don t think it s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him. I am not blaming her directly for this, because that isn t right. But where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn t always because people are rapists. Then, the obligatory victim blaming: This is completely different from a woman getting kidnapped and raped as she is walking to her car in a parking lot. That is a rapist. These are not rapists. These are idiot boys and girls having too much to drink and not being aware of their surroundings and having clouded judgement. No, this was not a case of two drunk kids taking things a little too far. This was a violent sexual assault. Here s just some of it, as retold by the victim:He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don t ask, can I finger you? Usually there s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He s in the clear. Even in his story, I only said a total of three words, yes yes yes, before he had me half naked on the ground. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls down help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls down, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls down help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that s why she wore the cardigan.Clearly, calling Turner a  rapist  isn t political correctness. It s simply a fact. Brock was convicted of three felony counts. While the maximum sentence for his offenses might have been 10 years, he will likely only serve three months. As horrendously unjust as that sentence is, it s still about three months longer than 97 percent of rapists serve. That s political incorrectness if I ve ever heard it.Featured image via video screen grab. ",0
"A Trump supporter in Loudoun County, Virginia, spent his Friday patrolling a polling place while armed with a gun. Go figure, the cops are perfectly okay with that.Erika Cotti says she came across him while she was trying to vote at the county registrar s office. I had my 9-year-old son with me. I felt intimidated,  Cotti said.  And I had to explain to my 9-year-old why a man with a 357 magnum is standing outside the polling station. The man then tried to get her to take a sample of the Republican ballot, but she refused it. He s like,  Who are you going to vote for, crooked Hillary?  And I was like, that s really none of your business,  Cotti said.According to Loudoun County registrar Judy Brown, there was indeed a man strutting around with a gun strapped to his hip who was handing out GOP propaganda in front of her office. However, police said that since Virginia is an open carry state, it is perfectly legal for him to do so. There is a gentleman standing outside the office with a holstered gun,  Brown said.  According to law enforcement, because Virginia is open carry, he s allowed to have it. Brown said that even though the man was obviously packing heat, he was being nice  to people and didn t violate the 40-foot no-canvassing zone in front of the entrance to the building.  They said that there s nothing they could do, that he was well within his rights to be carrying his weapon,  Brown said.Brown decided to get in touch with the state Republican Party. Their answer was to get the guy to pull his Trump shirt over the gun on his side so that it wasn t clearly visible. Out of sight, out of mind, right? Hopefully nobody else will be concerned about him,  Brown said.Loudoun County Republican Committee Chairman Will Estrada said that the man has military and law enforcement experience, as well as a concealed carry permit.  We don t want to startle anyone,  Estrada said he told him.  He felt really bad, he pulled his T-shirt over it, and I think everything was fine after that. Estrada also said that he does not support the idea of banning volunteers from carrying firearms. It s a free country,  Estrada said.  I m a NRA life member myself. So long as no laws are being broken, I m not going to tell someone they can t. But I ve told all of our volunteers that we re here for our candidates, we don t want us to become the story. Cotti, who has been involved in political activism, said she gets that Virginia is an open-carry state but still doesn t think it should be acceptable to have random people blocking the entrances to polling places with guns. We re an open carry state, I get that. But he s wearing a huge Trump t-shirt, he has a huge gun, and he was obstructing my exit on public property,  Cotti said.  That s insane to me.

"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s President Michel Temer has made policy and spending concessions in an effort to survive a congressional vote on corruption charges Wednesday that has put his reform agenda at risk, analysts and political actors said. To please the powerful farm lobby that has two-fifths of the votes in the lower house, Temer agreed to lower fines for environmental damage. He attempted to relax a definition of slave labor but was forced to backtrack after an outcry. In the clearest move to favor an ally, the Republican Party that has 37 seats in the 512-seat chamber and runs the Transport Ministry, Temer removed Sao Paulo s busy and lucrative Congonhas airport from a list of airports to be privatized. The party has appointees in the ministry and state airport operator Infraero. Critics and political observers say Temer has sacrificed austerity policies to save his presidency but will emerge from Wednesday s vote a weakened leader unable to pass substantial measures, such as an overhaul of the pension system. Temer faces charges in a bribery case based on testimony by an owner of the world s largest meatpacker JBS SA that has implicated several of his cabinet ministers. The lower house decides whether a president should stand trial before the Supreme Court, which can only take place if two-thirds of deputies vote for it.   He will survive because he has a majority, though not my vote because I believe there is enough evidence to put him on trial by the Supreme Court,  said Fabio Sousa, a lawmaker of the centrist the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), a member of Temer s governing coalition. Temer managed to block a first corruption charge in August. Now he faces charges of obstruction of justice and criminal organization for allegedly receiving bribes from JBS. Temer has met with dozens of lawmakers in recent days to secure their votes. Presidential aides said he hopes to widen his margin of support so that he can move ahead with his reforms, paralyzed for six months by the political crisis. Those votes come at a cost, in pork-barrel spending. According to public spending watchdog Contas Abertas, Temer fast-tracked spending in congressional districts worth 4.4 billion reais ($1.3 billion) to help win the first vote, and is now hitting the 2 billion real mark ahead of Wednesday s vote. O Globo newspaper estimated the cost of Temer s handouts to taxpayers at 12 billion reais, half of which would have come  from the planned airport concession auction. Yet most analysts believe Temer will get less votes this time, because lawmakers have started to distance themselves from his government ahead of next year s general elections.  After this vote, Temer will become a lame duck president. It will be very difficult for him to pass any reforms,  said David Fleischer, politics professor emeritus at Brasilia University. Investors are waiting to see if Temer can deliver a pension reform to tackle a budget deficit that cost brazil its investment grade credit rating.  If he does get social security reform approved, it will be badly watered down,  Fleischer said. ",1
"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The Australian government has resumed the use of Chinese-built drones in non-classifed situations, the country s defense minister said on Thursday.  Australia s defense forces had put on hold its deployment of China-made drones while it reviewed cybersecurity, following in the steps of the United States, Defence Minister Marise Payne said on the sidelines of an event in Washington. The U.S. Army said in August it had ordered its members to stop using drones made by Chinese manufacturer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd because of  cyber vulnerabilities  in the products.  Following the decision of the U.S. Army, we reviewed our own use of those particular articles and paused our use of them for a while,  she said.  Following that review, we were comfortable with resuming their use in an unclassified situation.  The Australian newspaper reported that the Australia Defence Force had 40 DJI drones which were used in military exercises, though the exact role played by the drones was not specified. DJI is a market leader in civilian drones and aerial imaging technology. ",1

"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru said on Monday that it was expelling North Korea s ambassador over the country s refusal to heed the world s  constant calls  to end its nuclear program. The ambassador, Kim Hak-Chol, has five days to leave Peru, the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement. Earlier this month North Korea launched its biggest nuclear bomb test, prompting global condemnation as U.S. President Donald Trump said  appeasement  would not work. Peru stressed that it was committed to a peaceful solution to the dispute and  strict compliance  with resolutions passed by the United Nations Security Council. The UN Security Council is set to vote on Monday to impose new sanctions on North Korea after the United States watered down the text of a resolution to appease China and Russia. Peru said it would  carry out all diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearizing the North Korean peninsula.  Peru s announcement follows a similar move by Mexico last week and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence s public call last month for Latin American nations to isolate Pyongyang. North Korea s embassy in Lima declined comment. ",1
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top lawmakers from both major U.S. political parties said on Sunday they trusted the Justice Department to appropriately handle its probe of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s private email server, after a heavily criticized meeting between Clinton’s husband and the U.S. attorney general. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said on CBS show “Face the Nation” that they would respect Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s decision on whether to prosecute Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.  Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also said he respected the process, though he acknowledged Lynch’s private meeting last week at an airport with former President Bill Clinton was unfortunate. “I think both of them wish their airplanes had never come anywhere near each other,” Schiff said on “Face the Nation,” adding that he still had confidence in the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to do a thorough investigation of Clinton’s email use. “If they say they are going to conduct this investigation by the book, I believe that’s what’s going to happen,” said Schiff, who supports Clinton for the party’s nomination. Lynch said on Friday that she would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute Clinton. The lawmakers’ endorsement for the process follows Clinton’s meeting Saturday with investigators at the FBI’s Washington headquarters, where she answered questions for three and a half hours as part of the probe into use of her private email server. The FBI is investigating Clinton’s email use and whether laws were broken as a result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Lawmakers and political strategists speculated on Sunday that the FBI’s interview of Clinton signaled its investigation could be nearing its end. But the FBI offered no information about the status of the probe or who its targets may be. Clinton has long insisted she is not a target. Clinton herself said in comments to MSNBC on Saturday that she “was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion.” Her rival, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, said it was “impossible” for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against her. The two have already begun an acrimonious battle ahead of the presidential election on Nov. 8. Democrats are hoping the issue will be resolved before their four-day convention in Philadelphia that begins July 25, which is expected to culminate with Clinton’s nomination for the presidential race. It is unclear what Democrats would do if Clinton were to be indicted and if any contingency plan exists.   Not all lawmakers said they were confident the Justice Department could maintain impartiality. Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday he thought Lynch’s meeting with Bill Clinton “raises questions about political interference in this investigation.” ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The departure on Friday of Steve Bannon, the White House’s top economic nationalist, will likely tip the trade policy scales in favor of the Trump administration’s “globalist” faction, which could soften the stance toward two of Trump’s favorite targets: China and the North American Free Trade Agreement. But after news that Trump had fired Bannon from his post as chief strategist, trade experts said it may take some time for National Economic Council Chairman Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to start winning more debates on trade policy. Bannon and White House Trade and Manufacturing Office director Peter Navarro were often allied in taking hardline anti-China stances over currency manipulation, steel tariffs and other trade issues, often opposed to Cohn, Mnuchin and Perdue, according to lobbyists who been involved in the debates. The Cohn-led group proved more influential in the administration’s decisions in April not to label China a currency manipulator and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement instead of terminating it.  More recently, they have pushed for a delay in a decision on the imposition of broad steel tariffs.     With Bannon gone, “there’s not a replacement for that voice in internal debates,” said a senior administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. “Without Steve constantly pushing back on every policy idea coming from the so called “globalists,” it’s easy to see how they could have a chance to start winning more policy battles,” the official said. In the short term, the trade policy trajectory won’t change much, said Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business conservative think tank in Washington. Many of Trump’s views on trade pre-dated Bannon’s arrival on his campaign in any case. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office announced on Friday that it will proceed with a planned investigation into whether China is misappropriating U.S. technology and intellectual property through unreasonable investment rules. Scissors said Bannon’s departure will show in what decisions the administration makes following a year-long study of the issue.   “It’s about the final choices on do we go forward with these very difficult sanctions on the Chinese or do we look to make a tradeoff on a security issue, and Bannon would have been in the first camp,” Scissors said. The struggle for influence in Trump’s White House “has been something of a battle between the finance guys and the economic nationalists, and the most important economic nationalist just left,” Scissors added. The offices of USTR Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who have been pushing for stronger trade policies to reduce U.S. trade deficits with China, Mexico and other countries, declined to comment on Bannon’s departure, referring policy questions to the White House. But industry lobbyists, who have been whipsawed by economic policy twists over trade and an ill-fated border tax proposal, were skeptical that much would change.  Two lobbyists on the sidelines of NAFTA talks in Washington said that even without Bannon, they will assume the status quo on trade policy as long as fierce China critic Navarro is in the White House. Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the administration’s efforts to develop an effective strategy to retaliate against China’s unfair trade practices will survive, largely because there is a widely held view in the administration and the corporate sector that China’s trade practices are a problem. “I doubt this effort will evaporate, though it may evolve,” she said.

"It s no secret has built a national coalition of minority voters. In the Democratic Primary, black and Hispanic voters came out and brought a sweep of the south for Clinton, thus edging her closer and closer to the nomination.It is this same minority population that might flip the southern state of Georgia in the November general election, and could tilt the electoral college in favor of Democrats for the first time since 1992. Before that, Democrats won in 1976 and 1980, when Jimmy Carter was president.A new poll from WSB 2 in Georgia shows a surprising result: Clinton and Trump are tied, 41 percent to 41 percent, with Trump winning whites and men and Clinton clinching women, African Americans, and Independents.Clinton is no fool. She knows perfectly well where she stands with Georgia. While appearing on ABC, the Democratic frontrunner pointed out that the state s demographics are growing in the Democrat s favor:In the last decade, Georgia s minority population has gone from 37%-44%. Eighty-one percent of the state s population growth has come from minorities. Blacks and Hispanics account for Georgia s population growth, and those two groups of voters are why the Clinton campaign seems to be gearing up to make a serious push to win Georgia.The only thing that could tip the scales in favor of Clinton is Independents. Although she leads Trump with them 36 percent to 28 percent, 38 percent remain undecided.If Clinton can tap into the Independent voters, and highlight just how crazy and destructive Donald Trump is, not only would Georgia turn blue, other southern sates could follow.And that s what Clinton is aiming to do:And I particularly want to support Democrats in states that have been voting against Democratic candidates for awhile now to rebuild the Democratic Party. We re going to try to make Georgia competitive, and we re going to fight hard in North Carolina and Virginia and Florida.Could there be a southern uprising in favor of Clinton? As the frontrunner looks towards the general election, stops in Ohio and Appalachia may also turn other red-leaning states blue.If Clinton keeps up her appeal to all (instead of just angry, white men), Democrats could have a great year. Georgia s latest poll is just one of more to come.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0

Reid then turned to DNC Chair Tom Perez for answers. As Perez started to speak from a location in Portland Oregon, where he was appearing with Bernie Sanders for an event, viewers can see people in the background setting up for an apparent event.

Watch the people tasked with setting up the Americans flags, as they drag the flag (on right side of the screen) across the ground before attempting to set it up.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - A top Chinese coal miner, Yankuang Group, and U.S. industrial gas supplier Air Products and Chemicals Inc on Thursday said they planned to build a $3.5 billion coal-to-synthesis gas (syngas) plant in China.  The announcement on the facility in the province of Shaanxi comes as part of U.S. President Donald Trump s state visit to China, the world s biggest consumer of coal. The deal is yet to be finalised, although the companies said in a statement that they would look to do this as soon as possible. Syngas is a combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and some carbon dioxide that is typically manufactured by gasifying a solid hydrocarbon fuel. It can be used to create energy or to help churn out products such as methane or methanol. Under the agreement, Air Products and Shaanxi Future Energy Group Co (SFEC), a subsidiary of Yankuang, will form a joint venture, in which Air Products will have a majority stake. It will build, own and operate an air separation, gasification and syngas clean-up system in the city of Yulin to supply SFEC, the firms said in a statement.  The air separation units are expected to produce about 40,000 tonnes per day (TPD) of oxygen to support the production of about 2.5 million normal cubic meters an hour of syngas.  SFEC will supply coal, steam and power and receive syngas under a long-term, onsite contract. Air Products currently supplies SFEC s Phase 1 project in Yulin with 12,000 TPD of oxygen.  The addition of Phase 2 would make the complex one of the largest coal-to-fuel and chemicals facilities in China, with SFEC Phase 2 producing 4 million tonnes per year of liquid fuels and downstream chemicals, it said. The companies expect the overall project to come onstream in 2021. ",1
"It wasn t too long ago that Republican nominee Donald Trump made us feel sick to our stomach when he told Gold Star parent Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim soldier that was killed defending this country, that he had  made a lot of sacrifices. It was a disgusting claim, as few people have been as entitled as Trump   but his campaign is back at it again, trying to depict Trump as someone who has actually worked hard.On Thursday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway insisted that the reason people were voting for Trump was because they appreciated all of the sacrifices he made by running for the White House. In a completely delusional interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo, Conway said: Donald Trump is closing with a positive message. He s talking about his love for the country, his love for the people, what he s going to do to help them solve everyday problems. And Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, has gone lower and lower. They re going totally negative. Obviously, the Trump campaign is now ignoring the fact that its entire campaign strategy has been negative, hateful and divisive. Conway s next statement was even more ridiculous, because Trump has tanked horribly with female voters and shown that he has zero respect for them throughout his entire life. Female voters especially don t like that. They feel they deserve and should be respected to have a substantive conversation. Conway called Trump, who has scammed and insulted more people than we can count throughout his campaign,  incredibly gracious and really funny. And he s doing this for all the right reasons. I mean, I think people will look back at this campaign   particularly after he wins on Tuesday   and they ll say, we totally missed how much America just appreciated  how much America appreciated the fact that he and his family made enormous sacrifices to run for president. Really,  enormous sacrifices?  This statement is just as sickening as when Trump mentions that  small  loan of one million dollars that his father gave him as he whines about how hard his life has been as a wealthy white male. Trump and his family basically had riches handed to them, and they haven t used it to do good. Even Trump s charities have failed to give back as much as Trump says they have.Considering she d already made so many false statements, Conway decided to go for the gold when she trashed Clinton and the Democratic Party. She said: I mean, this is not the Democratic Party that you and I grew up in, Chris. It has gone so far to the left, I can t even reach my hand out and touch it. Cuomo deserves an award for keeping a straight face through this. You can watch Conway in action below:Featured image is a screenshot",0

" OSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will be the only country to take part in rebuilding Syrian energy facilities, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said on Monday, after holding talks in Syria with President Bashar al-Assad, the RIA news agency reported. Rogozin was speaking a week after President Vladimir Putin ordered  a significant part  of Moscow s military contingent in Syria start withdrawing, declaring their work largely done. His comments offered a glimpse of how Moscow hopes it can be involved in Syria s economy, which has been badly damaged by six years of conflict.  The Syrian leadership would like to only cooperate with Russia ... in rebuilding all of the country s energy facilities,  RIA quoted Rogozin as saying.  Mr. President Bashar al-Assad said today that Syria has no desire to work with companies from countries which betrayed Syria at a certain moment,  he was cited as saying. The Interfax news agency also quoted Rogozin as saying that Russia and Syria would create a joint company to exploit a Syrian phosphates deposit, while RIA cited him as saying that Moscow planned to use Syrian sea ports to import Russian grain for Syria and other countries like Iraq.       These are very important agreements which will allow us to win this war,  Interfax quoted Rogozin as saying. ",1
"    (Welcome) to America We hope you enjoy our benefits. Please feel free to NOT assimilate  Coming soon: Press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish and 3 for Arabic The Obama Administration is on pace to issue more than a million green cards to migrants from majority-Muslim countries, according to an analysis of Department of Homeland Security data.A chart released by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest Friday details the surge in immigration to the U.S. from majority-Muslim countries since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.Specifically, in the first six fiscal years of Obama s presidency (FY2009   FY2014), his administration issued 832,014 green cards to migrants majority-Muslim countries, the most of which were issued to migrants from Pakistan (102,000), Iraq (102,000), Bangladesh (90,000), Iran (85,000), Egypt (56,000), and Somalia (37,000).The total 832,014 new permanent residents do not include migrants on temporary, nonimmigrant visas   which allow foreign nationals to come to the U.S. temporarily for work, study, tourism and the like. As the subcommittee notes, the number also does not include those migrants who overstayed the terms of their visas.Regardless, as the subcommittee explained in its analysis, the U.S. is playing host to immigrants from majority Muslim countries at an increasing pace.Between FY 2013 and FY 2014, the number of green cards issued to migrants from Muslim-majority countries increased dramatically   from 117,423 in FY 2013, to 148,810 in FY 2014, a nearly 27 percent increase. Throughout the Obama Administration s tenure, the United States has issued green cards to an average of 138,669 migrants from Muslim-majority countries per year, meaning that it is nearly certain the United States will have issued green cards to at least 1.1 million migrants from Muslim-majority countries on the President s watch. It has also been reported that migration from Muslim-majority countries represents the fastest growing class of migrants.Green cards, or Lawful Permanent Residency, puts immigrants on the path to citizenship and allows for lifetime residency, federal benefits, and work authorization. Included in the totals are refugees, who are required to apply for a green card after one year of residency in the U.S. Unlike other types of immigrants, refugees are immediately eligible for welfare benefits including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, and Medicaid.

"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The populist Danish People s Party (DF), upon whose support the minority government depends to pass laws, gave its backing on Friday to a fiscal budget for 2018 but one of the coalition parties said it still wanted an agreement on tax cuts. The Liberal Alliance (LA), a junior partner in the three-way coalition led by Prime Minister Lokke Rasmussen s Liberals and also including the Conservative party said it would not support the budget in parliament unless a deal to cut taxes was agreed. But DF, which is not a member of the coalition, said it could not guarantee that a deal involving  historically big tax cuts  could be reached. If LA does not vote to give the budget final approval, Rasmussen could be forced either to hand power to the Social Democrat-led opposition or to call a snap election.  We don t know how this will all end,  DF s negotiator Ren  Christensen told reporters.  Otherwise we would have had three deals now,  he said, referring to another proposal by DF that would tighten rules on granting residency to refugees. Economy minister Simon Emil Ammitzboll-Bille, a LA lawmaker, said the budget negotiations had been  chaotic  and there had been a  crisis of confidence  between the parties, but that the confidence had now been re-established. Tax cuts have been on the right-leaning government s wish list for a long time, but pro-welfare DF has been less eager to back that part of the government s policies. The parties will meet again after the weekend to discuss the proposed tax cuts and DF s proposal to make it easier for authorities to revoke residence permits for refugees from war once there is peace in their home countries. The budget deal includes among other things increased spending on health and elderly care and on infrastructure. ",1
"Beebe, Arkansas mayor, Mike Robertson, loves Jesus. He loves Jesus so much that he s using public dollars to fund a gospel band for Beebe s 4th of July celebration, and he knows what he s doing, too. Otherwise, he wouldn t have said this in his letter urging residents to come out: I am pleased to announce that this year s live music will be provided by Grammy-Nominated, Multiple Award-Winning Gospel Artists, The Bowling Family The Bowling Family combines talent, sincerity and experience to create a memorable concert experience. Their goal for the evening is to usher in the presence of god and to celebrate the Christian message. They feel privileged and honored to enjoy the freedom to honor Christ with any and all of their abilities.  [emphasis mine]You can read the letter in its entirety here.It s ironic that he d knowingly pick a gospel band to help his town celebrate a day on which our founders declared their independence from the British Crown, and sought things like religious freedom for the colonies. It s sad, too; Robertson clearly practices the religious right s warped and twisted view of American history.David Niose, the legal director of the American Humanist Association, sent a stern letter of warning to Robertson s office, saying that a concerned citizen had contacted him about usurping our Independence Day, along with public dollars, to endorse a religion not everyone in Beebe practices. The American Humanist Association has successfully sued other government entities for promoting religion in the past, and Niose makes a point of mentioning that. He also said: You should not be surprised that some of your constituents object to your use of the apparatus of government, which of course is funded by citizens of various religious backgrounds, to endorse and promote your personal religion. Indeed, Beebe was also the center of controversy in 2014 when a family there opened a small, pagan temple in their garage. Robertson was initially behind that, thinking it was a little Christian church, but when he found out it was pagan, he changed his mind and claimed that zoning laws forbade a place of worship on that property.In fact, zoning laws actually allowed it. Robertson just doesn t like the idea that there are people in his town that practice a different religion than he does. Worse, he believes that public officials should be praying to his god  as the true leader of the nation.  This is Christian zealotry at its finest. Freedom for Christianity and Christians, but not for anyone else.Roberston told OneNewsNow that the city is acting fairly, and he s prepared to defend having this gospel group at their 4th of July event: We ve had all different types of entertainment. And we try each year to change it to do something for everybody s desire and liking, and so we chose a gospel group. He went on to say that people could just stay home if they don t like it. Wow. Just wow. Perhaps he s the one who should stay home, and let people who actually understand freedom of religion, along with the whole reason we even celebrate that day, plan this event.Featured image via Beebe, Ark. official website",0

"The drip drip drip of communism Leftists are stealing our rights and freedom while Americans can t be bothered with  politics  because they re too busy watching the Kardashians The Florida High School Athletics Association recently denied a request by two Christian schools to broadcast a prayer before a championship game at Orlando s Citrus Bowl Stadium.Cambridge Christian School in Tampa and the University Christian School out of Jacksonville are playing in the District 2-A high school football championships today and coaches from both teams submitted a request to ensure a 30-second prayer over the loudspeaker before kickoff, Bay News 9 reports.But Roger Dearing, director of the Florida High School Athletics Association, denied the request for two main reasons. The facility is a public facility, predominantly paid for with public tax dollars, makes the facility  off limits  under federal guidelines and precedent court cases,  Dearing wrote in an emailed response to the teams.  In Florida Statutes, the FHSAA (host and coordinator of the event) is legally a  State Actor,  we cannot legally permit or grant permission for such an activity. Cambridge head of school Tim Euler doesn t agree with Dearing s ruling. We ve played 13 football games this year,  he told Bay News 9  We ve prayed before every one of them. Here s the problem,  Euler told WTSP.  The Florida Legislature is opened up with prayer in a building that is paid by tax dollars. What is the difference? If they can pray there, we can pray here, and I want them to be able to pray there and I want us to be able to pray here,  he added.  So I think (Dearing s) reasoning is flawed at the core of it. Euler said Friday morning, hours before the game s 1 p.m. start time, that it s unlikely the teams would be able to reverse the decision, but believes it s important to highlight the problem, nonetheless. What we really want to do is raise awareness,  he told Bay News 9.  All we re asking for is an opportunity for two Christian schools to pray. WTSP attempted to contact the Florida High School Athletic Association about the ruling, but the agency ignored its request.WTSP reporter Mike Deeson posted about the controversy on Facebook. I was disappointed the Florida High School Athletic Association didn t return our calls,  he wrote.  I wanted to know how the legislature opens with a prayer in a taxpayer owned building with state employees, yet FHSAA maintains a prayer couldn t be said in a taxpayer funding facility the Citrus Bow that was sanctioned by state employees, members of FHSAA. Something doesn t make sense when you compare the two   but they NEVER returned our calls,  Deeson posted.  In my opinion that was a BAD PR MOVE! Readers, of course, were enraged by the FHSAA s decision. I think it s absolutely ridiculous that they will not let two Christian schools pray before their game,  Mary Salvatore posted to Facebook.  And you wonder why we have so many mass shootings across the country! So PC and so tolerant that you become intolerant,  Robert Rosengarten added.  Let them pray, who gives a f. If they want to pray to Jesus, Allah, the flying spaghetti monster, let them, who cares. Who s to stop them?  Daniel Suarez questioned.  What if both teams come together before the game and pray? What if all in the stands begin to pray? Who would it hurt?  Via: EAG News",0
"So that immigration crisis you never hear about on your evening news? It s not over. Not by a long shot.With only a few months left to go before a new president obtains the keys to the Oval Office, the Obama administration released another 6,051 unaccompanied alien children into American communities in the month of October, averaging about 195 kids per day.According to recent stats released by the Executive Office for Immigration Review, only about 45 percent of all immigration cases opened for unaccompanied minors since July of 2014 have been closed. EOIR data also shows that nearly 40 percent of all illegal alien children ordered to appear before an immigration judge won t show up for their final court hearing.Children who come across the border unlawfully and without a parent or guardian are being released at an alarming rate that corresponds with the increasing number of kids currently being apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border. In October alone, Customs and Border Protection reported they apprehended 46,197 illegal aliens crossing into the United States unlawfully via the Southwest U.S. border, including 13,124 members of family units and another 6,754 unaccompanied children. For entire story: MRCTVWhat has escaped all but a few conversations are the short and long term implications of this flood of children haphazardly being placed in detention or residential settings, or released to family members, and how it can precipitate a fertile recruiting opportunity for gangs such as MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang, who already have assimilation within this diaspora, putting not only domestic but regional security in question.Since 2009, the numbers of unaccompanied alien children up to 17 years old, as they are designated by Customs and Border Protection under the aegis of the Department of Homeland Security, has grown exponentially, with children from Honduras representing the largest diaspora, followed by Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico.  HMSnetThis is an especially heartwarming story for the working American taxpayer who s trying to figure out how they re going to be able to scrape enough extra money together to buy their own children a gift for Christmas.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury will enforce all sanctions against Russia unless a deal were reached between Washington and Moscow, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the department said on Thursday. Asked during a Senate confirmation hearing if he was committed to enforcing existing sanctions against Russia, Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin said: “100 percent so.

"James O Keefe s Project Veritas reporters went undercover at CNN to investigate the #VeryFakeNews network to determine the motivation behind CNN s Trump-Russia collusion obsession. Since the inauguration, CNN has mentioned  Russian story  nearly 16,000 times.Project Veritas  reporters can be seen in the video below having a conversation with CNN s supervising producer John Bonifield. The reporter talked to Bonifield first about the constant barrage of Trump-Russia stories on CNN. Bonifield admitted that although CNN has no evidence or proof of Trump involvement with Russia, they continue to make it their top story on CNN simply for  ratings  and to  make money. Bonifield actually confessed to the undercover Project Veritas journalist that President Trump is correct when he says the media is on a  witch hunt  to take him down. Bonifield told the reporter:  I think the President is right to say, like, look you are  witch hunting me  You have no real smoking gun, you have no proof. Bonifield told the undercover reporter for Project Veritas that CNN is biased and is playing to their audience by attacking President Trump, and actually admitted that  Trump is good for business right now.  The Project Veritas reporter asked Bonifield,  But honestly, you think the whole Russia shit is bullshit?  to which Bonifield replied:  Could be bullshit. I mean, it s mostly bullshit right now. Like, we don t have any big, giant proof. The way these leaks happen, they d leak it. It d leak. If it was something really good, it would leak. President Trump took to Twitter this morning to call out CNN. In his tweet, Trump hinted that Fake News CNN would likely be replacing the top brass at the dishonest and discredited network. Trump also mentioned CNN s failing ratings, to which CNN Communications boasted that after months of reporting lies about a phony Trump-Russia collusion story, their ratings have actually increased. In other words, because we dragged your name through the mud and falsely accused you of collusion with the Russians without a shred of evidence, our ratings have actually gone up with our liberal viewers who are desperate for any negative Trump news.

" It s not a question of Curiel s Hispanic heritage. It s the web of his connections that gives the appearance of bias in favor of Hillary Clinton and against Republicans.    Former Bush AG Alberto GonzalezFormer Attorney General in the Bush Administration, Alberto Gonzalez, penned an op ed in the Washington Post today, giving Donald Trump some cover in his rampage against a Mexican American judge presiding over the lawsuit against Trump University:It is crucial to understand the real issue in this matter. I am not judging whether Curiel is actually biased against Trump. Only he knows the answer to that question. I am not saying that I would be concerned about him presiding over a case in which I was a litigant. And if I were a litigant who was concerned about the judge s impartiality, I certainly would not deal with it in a public manner as Trump has, because it demeans the integrity of the judicial office and thus potentially undermines the independence of the judiciary, especially coming from a man who could be president by this time next year. But none of these issues is the test. The test is whether there is an  appearance of impropriety  under the facts as they reasonably appear to a litigant in Trump s position. Certainly, Curiel s Mexican heritage alone would not be enough to raise a question of bias (for all we know, the judge supports Trump s pledge to better secure our borders and enforce the rule of law). As someone whose own ancestors came to the United States from Mexico, I know ethnicity alone cannot pose a conflict of interest.But there may be other factors to consider in determining whether Trump s concerns about getting an impartial trial are reasonable. Curiel is, reportedly, a member of a group called La Raza Lawyers of San Diego. Trump s aides, meanwhile, have indicated that they believe Curiel is a member of the National Council of La Raza:La Raza is a vocal advocacy organization that has vigorously condemned Trump and his views on immigration:Judge Curiel, an activist for illegal immigration, works on behalf of San Diego La Raza immigration activists to select illegal aliens for scholarships: Below is the La Raza promotion of Judge Curiel as he sits on the Scholarship Selection Committee:It is transparently obvious to those who are following the events that Judge Curiel not only holds a bias against Mr. Trump, but also holds a political agenda specifically intended to protect his ideological  Open Border  advocacy.In a New York Times article, which relied on the  unredacted mistake release  a former employee of the Trump Organization, Ronald Schnackenberg, espouses his unhappiness with the former employ:In a set of documents unsealed on Tuesday, Mr. Schnackenberg, a sales manager, recounted how he was reprimanded for not pushing a financially struggling couple hard enough to sign up for a $35,000 real estate class, despite his conclusion that it would endanger their economic future. (link)However, as with all other elements of this political nonsense, Mr. Schnackenberg went to work for the pinnacle spokesperson for the Never Trump conscripts, Glenn Beck. You really just can t make this stuff up.The two groups are unaffiliated, and Curiel is not a member of NCLR. But Trump may be concerned that the lawyers  association or its members represent or support the other advocacy organization. Coupled with that question is the fact that in 2014, when he certified the class-action lawsuit against Trump, Curiel appointed the Robbins Geller law firm to represent plaintiffs. Robbins Geller has paid $675,000 in speaking fees since 2009 to Trump s likely opponent, Hillary Clinton, and to her husband, former president Bill Clinton. Curiel appointed the firm in the case before Trump entered the presidential race, but again, it might not be unreasonable for a defendant in Trump s position to wonder who Curiel favors in the presidential election.Read more: PJ MediaRead more: conservative treehouse",0
"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Joking that “opposites attract,” Prime Minister Theresa May called on President Donald Trump on Thursday to renew the “special relationship” between Britain and the United States and lead in a new, changed world. In the United States for what will be Trump’s first meeting with a foreign leader since he took office last week, May signaled a shift in foreign policy, bringing her position more in line with that of Trump. She urged the two countries and their leaders to stand united and confront new challenges, including the rise of economies in Asia that people fear could “eclipse the West,” the threat of Islamic extremism and a resurgent Russia. “So we - our two countries together - have a responsibility to lead. Because when others step up as we step back, it is bad for America, for Britain and the world,” May told members of Republican Party at their retreat in a speech often punctuated by applause from an enthusiastic crowd. “This cannot mean a return to the failed policies of the past. The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over. But nor can we afford to stand idly by.” Her break with the interventionism that launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan underscores a change in global politics.     It also fits with Trump’s move to put “America first” and scores well with voters in Britain whose feeling of being left behind by globalization helped fuel Britain’s vote to leave the EU last year that propelled May to power. Aware that Brexit will shape her legacy, May welcomed her early visit to the United States, a boost to her attempts to show that Britain can prosper outside the European Union despite criticism at home for cozying up to Trump. On her U.S.-bound flight, May concentrated on similarities with the U.S. leader, who some reporters suggested had a style in stark contrast to her more cautious, restrained approach. “Haven’t you ever noticed ... sometimes opposites attract?” she answered with a laugh. Eager to win favor — and a trade deal — with the new U.S. president to bolster her hand in the divorce talks with the European Union, May said both countries shared many values and that, contrary to his statements that NATO was “obsolete,” Trump had told her he was committed to the U.S.-led military alliance. May said she supported Trump’s “reform agenda” to make NATO and the United Nations “more relevant and purposeful than they are today,” and “many of the priorities your government has laid out for America’s engagement with the world.”  But there may be sticking points in Friday’s talks - May said she condemned the use of torture and would stick to UK policy, suggesting Britain may not accept intelligence that could have come from such methods that Trump could reintroduce. “We condemn torture and my view on that won’t change – whether I’m talking to you or talking to the president,” she said when asked what impact it would have if Trump brought back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret prisons. May will have navigate the middle ground carefully, wary of being criticized as too pro-Trump or alternatively as too negative toward a future trading partner.  She has threatened to walk away from the EU if she fails to get a good deal, and some critics say that could give other countries, like the United States, the upper hand in any talks.  And the EU might not take kindly to any overly friendly overtures to a president some of the bloc’s main leaders have voiced concern about. Some kind of trade agreement, though, is high on her list of priorities, despite Britain and the United States being at odds over genetically modified organisms, meat production and public procurement and May unable to sign deals until after Brexit. May says she will launch the divorce talks by the end of March by triggering Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, which gives up to two years to negotiate an exit deal. Only then can she agree with third countries. Both leaders should use the time to find areas where they could remove trade barriers, May said. “We’re both very clear that we want a trade deal.” ",1

"Fox News and Republican front-runner Donald Trump have been in a strange power struggle ever since Trump decided to boycott the network s Thursday night GOP debate because the business mogul can t stand to be in the same room as Fox host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly.Clearly shaken up since Kelly got the best of him the first time she moderated the Republican debate, Trump has decided to make the GOP lineup look like even more of a circus by skipping the debate. So far the network is standing by Kelly, stating that it wouldn t give into  terrorizations toward any of our employees.  But it appears that Fox might not be genuine, as it is still secretly trying to get Trump back in by using two secret weapons   Trump s wife and daughter.On Wednesday morning, Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough exposed Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for trying to get Ivanka and Melania Trump to change The Donald s mind about skipping the debate, but Trump refused to speak with him and insisted that he d only speak with network owner Rupert Murdoch.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Two veteran allies of Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed to Germany s parties on Tuesday to strike a compromise and form a stable government that could drag Europe s biggest economy out of a political impasse. The collapse of talks between Merkel s conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens has thrown Germany into political uncertainty and raised the prospect of new elections. It has cast doubt over whether Merkel, Europe s most powerful leader after 12 years in office, will serve a fourth term after her conservatives bled support to the far-right in a Sept. 24 election, though still won the most seats. There are wider implications too for Europe since the collapse of talks means the euro zone s ambitious plans for deeper economic integration could now be put on hold, euro zone officials said in Brussels on Tuesday.  Merkel s former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, now in the impartial role of parliamentary president, said compromise was the order of the day while chancellery chief Peter Altmaier gave parties three weeks to sort out the mess.  We must be in a situation in the next three weeks where there is clarity about whether there can be a stable government on the basis of this election result,  Altmaier, also acting finance minister, told ZDF television. Merkel has said she prefers new elections to an unstable minority government. Until a government is agreed, she continues as acting chancellor and previous ministers remain in post, while the newly-elected parliament also proceeds with business. Pressure is growing on the Social Democrats (SPD) whose leader Martin Schulz has refused to contemplate re-entering a Merkel-led government after voters punished them for sharing power with her for the last four years.  Many in the SPD fear that another four-year term with Merkel, who is herself still popular, would mean their political suicide.  Altmaier appealed to the SPD to reconsider:  Like  Made in Germany , we are known for having a stable and reliable government ... we must give the SPD a chance to think.  Andrea Nahles, head of the SPD s parliamentary group reiterated that it did not want to prop up Merkel again.   We are not an emergency stop-gap for Merkel,  she said.  However, she also said the SPD would use talks with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is meeting party leaders to explore possibilities to form a government, to find solutions, hinting at other possible options.  We should talk about how we form a process that leads our country into a new, stable government,  Nahles said, adding this might be a minority government or new elections. Steinmeier met FDP and Greens leaders on Tuesday, but they made no comment after the meetings. One option could be an alliance between the conservatives and Greens, who built up a certain level of trust during the exploratory talks, which could be  tolerated  by the SPD. That could guarantee some government policies get through parliament. Michael Kellner, a top Greens negotiator, said it was up to Merkel s party to propose such a minority government, but did not rule it out as an option. In a sign that compromise is still possible, Merkel s Christian Democrats, FDP and Greens voted together on a motion in parliament on Tuesday to create the conditions for Ireland to pay back debts early to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). One former SPD leader Bjoern Engholm said the SPD should rethink their  no  to a grand coalition, but he said any such alliance would only be possible without Merkel. Many commentators think the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) stand to gain most from new elections although polls show no big differences from the September results. Due to a protracted procedure designed to avoid repeated elections, a new vote would take months to organize, raising worries that European reform efforts will be held up.  Europe needs a Germany that is capable of acting,  said  Schaeuble.  The reactions from abroad show that Europe and many other countries in the world are waiting for us.  He said it was important for parties to compromise to avert a crisis, saying this did not mean parties had to ditch their principles.  The task is huge, but it s not unsolvable.  ",1

"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump agreed on Tuesday that they should work to build relationships through the U.S. transition and meet at the earliest opportunity. Britain has long cherished its “special relationship” with the United States as a central pillar of its foreign policy, but speculation has been widespread in London about how ties would evolve under Trump after a series of perceived snubs from him. “The Prime Minister called the U.S. President-elect this afternoon as part of establishing a regular dialogue between both of them,” May’s Downing Street office said in a statement. “They discussed how the President-elect’s transition plans were progressing and agreed that their teams should continue to build close relationships through this period, including with a meeting of their National Security Advisers in the United States before Christmas,” it said. Trump caused astonishment in London last week when he suggested that Nigel Farage of the opposition UKIP party, a firebrand of the Brexit cause and vitriolic critic of the ruling Conservatives, should be Britain’s ambassador to Washington. The government responded that there was no vacancy, but the suggestion, an unprecedented breach of diplomatic protocol, was embarrassing for Downing Street. Following his election, Trump spoke to nine other world leaders before he spoke to May, which also raised eyebrows in London. In Tuesday’s call, the two leaders also discussed NATO, agreeing on its importance and on the need for more members of the alliance to meet the target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense.  Britain already meets that commitment, but Trump has repeatedly complained about others falling short, raising concerns in other NATO countries about his intentions toward the organization. ",1

"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ted Wade hasn’t cared about politics enough to cast a vote in a U.S. presidential election for almost a quarter of a century, back when he supported Ross Perot’s independent candidacy in 1992. But Republican Donald Trump’s 2016 White House bid has motivated Wade to get involved and he plans to support the real estate mogul in Nevada’s nominating caucus next month. Trump is a “non-politician” who can fix the “chaos” in Washington, he says. About one in 10 Americans who plan to cast a vote this election will do so for the first time in years, if ever, and Trump holds a decided edge with them, according to polling by Reuters/Ipsos. (tmsnrt.rs/1SgeLvi) These voters offer Trump a pool of voters who could be decisive either in the Republican primaries or a general election. They could be crucial for Trump in early-voting states such as Iowa and South Carolina, where his nearest rival, Senator Ted Cruz, is putting pressure on Trump and enjoys a strong base of support with more traditionally conservative voters. In Reuters/Ipsos polling from June to December 2015, 27.3 percent of these “new” voters said they would vote for Trump, higher than his poll numbers among independents and Republicans who regularly vote. By way of comparison, Cruz captures just 3.4 percent of these voters. And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida snags only 4 percent. “I’m tired of the chaos between Democrats and Republicans and want to give somebody a try who I think can make a difference,” said Wade of Trump. The 51-year-old has already switched his affiliation from Democrat to Republican and even attended a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas. He has told his three older children to get involved in the elections, although he did not say whether he wanted them to vote for Trump.  Trump, the Republican front-runner, has made targeting “lost” voters such as Wade a focus of his campaign. His anti-immigrant rhetoric and protectionist trade proposals have helped him to fashion a message tailored to reach Americans alienated by the endless enmity between the political parties and who, because of declining economic prospects, may feel like neither party has done much for them. Trump’s strategy is a gamble, given the lack of reliability of many of the voters with whom he is most popular. In interviews, some of those lost voters insist they will show up, saying they are drawn to Trump’s outsider status and his willingness to upend the political system. Tucson, Arizona, resident Renay Cunningham, 56, said she had never paid much attention to politics in the past. She plans to cast her first ever vote for Trump after hearing his proposed policies to curb illegal immigration, which include building a giant wall on the southern border and making Mexico pay for it. “We need a piranha in there, and he’s definitely a piranha,” she said. Trump and his operatives are confident they can do what few of his rivals for the Republican nomination have shown they can do — expand the party’s potential voter pool. But while Democrat Barack Obama did that eight years ago by largely registering new voters, including record levels of minorities, both male and female, in urban centers, Trump’s campaign has instead largely sought out the disaffected, who tend to be overwhelmingly older, white, and less educated than the broader electorate. “My whole campaign has been focused on expanding the number of people who want to, and will, participate in this election cycle,” Trump wrote in a recent op-ed in USA Today. When analyzing “lost” or “new” voters, Reuters compiled poll results from people who haven’t voted in the previous two presidential campaigns and midterm congressional elections. The results focused only on those who said they were nearly certain to vote in the November election. It included responses from 3,440 “new” Republican and independent voters – a sample that has a credibility interval of 2 percentage points. Jan Leighley, an expert on turnout at American University, said it’s too soon to compare Trump’s “new” voters with the disenfranchised voters, especially minorities, who in 2008 turned out in record numbers to elect the first black president. Those voters didn’t find their way to the polls simply because they were inspired to make history, Leighley said. “He also had a kick-ass mobilization structure.” “Obama’s campaign went door-to-door. They canvassed whole neighborhoods. “I don’t know if he (Trump) has the campaign infrastructure to make sure that the folks who are riled up are walked to the polls on Election Day,” she said. Trump’s campaign insists he does have the infrastructure, but won’t provide specifics on how it intends to turn casual supporters into engaged voters. The campaign says it does follow up with the thousands of attendees who jam arenas for Trump’s rallies. That’s one significant advantage the reality star has over the other candidates in the Republican field, as the challenge in reaching voters who have fallen out of the political process often lies in simply locating them. “We’ve identified a lot of people in early primary states who have not participated in the process before,” campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters. Lewandowski resists the notion that Trump needs to turn out “new” or reluctant voters to win states such as Iowa. Even if the Trump campaign isn’t necessarily counting on them, it may be reassuring that his supporters among “new” voters who responded to the Reuters/Ipsos survey appear motivated to cast a vote for him. At least for the time being. Ronald Thomas, a 49-year-old truck driver and Navy veteran in North Carolina, said he, too, has never voted in a presidential contest. His girlfriend would push him to vote but he would always say “Yeah, but the right one ain’t come along yet,’” Thomas said. Trump is that man. His willingness to take on the government has set him apart as someone who would “actually look out for the people,” said Thomas. Now he wants to know how to register so that he can vote for the billionaire.  And there’s Vince DiSylvester, a retired maintenance worker in Missouri, who, at 73, said has never cast a ballot for president. But Trump has inspired him to rethink that. “He’s a businessman, he knows business, he knows how to get things done,” he said. “And he tells it like it is. If you don’t like it - well, too bad.”  (Editing by Ross Colvin) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",1
"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s major party leaders met with their caucuses on Tuesday, preparing to kick off talks on forming the next government with a nationalist party that holds the balance of power after an inconclusive weekend election. The ruling National Party won the most seats in Saturday s general election, but failed to secure enough to form a government, leaving the New Zealand First Party in the position of kingmaker. Deputy leaders of both the ruling National and opposition Labour parties said they would be willing to give up the role of deputy prime minister to win the backing of Winston Peters, who  leads New Zealand First. But the Labour Party, whose support spiked after Jacinda Ardern became leader last month, also has a chance to govern in New Zealand s proportional representation system, if it can woo Peters into a coalition along with the Green Party. Ardern said she had  every chance  to become the country s youngest prime minister in modern history, adding that her team had contacted that of Peters, a veteran politician who has served in National and Labour governments.  We are willing and available when he is ready,  Ardern, 37, told reporters in Wellington.   I respect the time that Mr. Peters will need to talk with his party.  Asked about possible sticking points in talks, she said budget responsibility rules would apply in any government Labour led.   Both National and Labour are expected to stick to fiscal prudence, but to differ on monetary policy, trade and immigration. Labour wants to cut immigration and renegotiate some trade deals that could hurt two key sources of growth. It wants to add employment to the central bank s inflation-targeting mandate, which could make monetary policy more stimulatory, and there is some concern about New Zealand First s preference for more central bank intervention in the currency market. The political uncertainty weighed on the New Zealand dollar , which was down 0.32 percent at $0.7243, after posting its biggest daily drop in more than four months on Monday. Forming a coalition government could take weeks, Prime Minister Bill English has said, though he hoped talks would be constructive, even if expected to be tense. English has courted Peters since election night, when he acknowledged his  strong performance , saying voters had given him a role in the new government s formation.  He understands his role and the role here is, now that we ve had an election where the people have spoken... then it s up to the political party leaders to form the kind of government indicated by the election,  English told media. The National Party secured 58 seats, ahead of the 52 won by the Green Party and Labour in Saturday s election, leaving both still in need of NZ First s nine seats to reach the tally of 61 required to form a government. A final tally of election results is due on Oct. 7, when  special votes , which constitute 15 percent of the total and include overseas votes, are released. English remains prime minister in the interim. ",1

"Earlier this week, Trump tried to stroke his vanity to maximum advantage by asking Politico for copies of their magazine that feature his face on the cover, because, you know, he s important and everyone must be reminded of that at all possible moments. Politico is one of many media outlets that Trump has banned from his events, though, and they are understandably unhappy about it. Nevertheless, they did as Trump bade, but with a stunning reply accompanying the magazines.National editor Kristin Roberts sent him a pointed note with the magazines, which do have an illustration of Trump on the front. She said: We are happy to provide Mr. Trump and his team with the POLITICO magazines that you requested.We hope Mr. Trump enjoys reading it in his spare time. In the spirit of open communication, perhaps this would be an appropriate time to ask when you will deliver to our reporters the credentials that we have requested for his many events. I know they would greatly appreciate it. Politico just dropped the mic here. It s almost a shame they couldn t do this onstage or on television, where they could literally drop the mic, because that s the only way this would be more perfect.It s not very clear why Trump banned Politico from his events, but some suspect it has something to do with unfavorable coverage of his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Trump and his campaign have actually banned several outlets from their events, and individual reporters from many more, because they aren t stroking his ego enough to make it grow.The Politico cover in question could be seen as portraying Trump in a poor light, or as flattering, depending on how one looks at it:A photo posted by Tracie Ching (@tracieching) on Jul 18, 2016 at 8:11am PDTNobody can accuse Politico of pandering to Trump, though, and a quick Google search,  Trump + Politico,  reveals all the horrible, evil, nasty things they ve said about him. Trump hasn t tweeted about this, and it doesn t seem he s made a statement about it either, so he can t be too upset yet.Or maybe he s just too busy calling Hillary  Crooked Hillary,  and accusing her of rigging the debates to care right now. Still, Politico got him good.Featured image by Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images",0

"The man behind the lovably hapless office drone  Dilbert  has a few things to say about Donald Trump   and they are a doozy.In a post on his blog, cartoonist Scott Adams blasted people who dared to compare Donald Trump to German dictator Adolf Hitler, describing the comparison as  racist  against German people.Can we agree that calling the candidate with German ancestry Hitler  is racist? It sure feels that way to me. I m about half German, same as Trump. And it feels like a racial insult to me.I m not easily offended, but I don t see any other way to interpret the incessant Hitler analogies directed at Trump. If he were female and Asian   with exactly the same policies   would we be comparing him to Hitler every five seconds?I don t think so.There are, of course, a few things wrong with Adams  analysis:  German  isn t a race, Hitler wasn t German, comparing one person with German ancestry to an infamous tyrant isn t  racist , the list goes on..But more to the point, Donald Trump wouldn t be an Asian female, because Donald Trump s policies   at their core   appeal to white supremacists who would never consider voting for a woman of color. The kind of hate-fueled rhetoric that makes Trump soar in the Republican polls is at the expense of minorities, women, and other disadvantaged groups. You know who else used prejudice and scapegoating to fire up his supporters? Adams sure can t think of anyone!However, Adams believes that Trump is actually the anti-Hitler, because   and this is pretty astounding   Trump is actually  pro-minority.  But only the  minorities  Adams considers worthy:What Adams doesn t mention are actual minorities, including Hispanics that Trump described as  rapists  or African Americans, who have been repeatedly violently attacked at his rallies. The minorities Adams counts are mostly just aggrieved white people who want things their way and are upset that President Obama won t give it to them.What about the Muslims Trump suggested should be banned? Adams agrees that s discrimination, but says they deserve it.Trump has indeed suggested discrimination against incoming Muslims. But I think you have to see this situation as a special case because Sharia law is incompatible with the Constitution of the United States. And conquering infidels is part of the Islamic belief system in some corners of Islam. If we can t tell the good people from the bad, it boils down to national security and risk-management.Hilariously, Adams concludes by begging his readers to instead try to compare Hitler to people like  Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and Gandhi.  He claims it s  easier than you want to believe.  He doesn t explain how.Despite all of this lunacy, Adams says he isn t endorsing Trump for president, but only because the Republican front-runner  scares  people too much to effectively bring the country together. However, he is optimistic that Trump could  persuade  people not to be afraid of him using his  deal-making  skills. If that happens, Adams seems to think Trump would be an awesome president. Just ask all those  minorities  he mentioned.Featured image via ibmphoto24/Flickr ",0

"LIMA (Reuters) - Neither of Peru s two vice presidents would open the door to new elections by resigning if President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was forced from office, Second Vice President Mercedes Araoz told Reuters late on Sunday. Araoz said she was confident Kuczynski was innocent of wrongdoing regarding recently-disclosed links he once had with Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company at the center of Latin America s biggest graft scandal. If Kuczynski is as expected unseated by the opposition-run Congress in a vote on Thursday, First Vice President Martin Vizcarra would immediately replace him.  New national elections would only be called if both Vizcarra - a former governor of a copper-rich mining region and Peru s current ambassador to Canada - and Araoz resigned or left office before the scheduled end of Kuczynski s term in 2021. But Araoz ruled out that scenario.  We re going to ensure that this government continues in power. Peru elected the three of us and both of us vice presidents are going to defend our mandate,  Araoz said in a brief phone interview. Araoz  remarks were the first explicit assurance by Kuczynski s center-right government that it would not abandon the presidency, and will likely soothe investor fears about the prospect of elections that could sweep anti-establishment candidates to power as the graft scandal roils the country. Odebrecht has sent shockwaves through Latin American politics since admitting a year ago that it had won lucrative public work contracts in Peru and nine countries in the region through a network of bribes and kickback schemes. The scandal has landed elites in jail from Colombia to the Dominican Republic, but has hit particularly hard in Peru, where Odebrecht once had an outsized presence. With Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, and two former presidents engulfed in the scandal and several opposition leaders under investigation, a majority of Peruvians want Kuczynski and lawmakers in Congress to leave office and prefer new elections to be called, a poll by Ipsos showed on Sunday. But Araoz said that would risk derailing progress Peru has made since its return to democracy at the turn of the century.  We want our economy to keep growing, we want to maintain democracy, we want to avoid dictatorial actions,  Araoz said in a veiled swipe at the opposition. Congress is controlled by a right-wing opposition party headed by media-shy Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, who is in prison for graft and human rights violations. Over the past year, Fujimori s foes have alleged that her party would use its majority in Congress to unseat Kuczynski in retribution for unexpectedly defeating her in the 2016 election - warnings that Kuczynski was now seizing on.  There s an attack on democratic order,  Kuczynski said late on Sunday in a televised interview with a group of local journalists.  We have to defend democracy because it s the only tool that guarantees us a path to prosperity... I implore all to continue our trajectory.  Fujimori s surrogates have denied she has sought to unseat Kuczynski for political reasons and describe a motion passed on Friday to start  presidential vacancy  proceedings as part of her party s fight against corruption. Kuczynski once denied having any links to Odebrecht.  But last week Odebrecht sent Congress a requested report that detailed $4.8 million in deposits it made over a decade-long period starting in 2004 to companies owned by Kuczynski or a close business associate of his. The payments include about $600,000 in financial services Kuczynski provided for an Odebrecht project as a private citizen and about $800,000 transferred to a company owned by him during and shortly after holding senior government posts. Kuczynski apologized to Peruvians for not having explained his links to Odebrecht properly. He denied taking bribes or anything improper about the business transactions.  I m absolutely sure. There was no corruption here,  Kuczynski said. ",1

"DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - The airport on the Indonesian holiday island of Bali reopened on Wednesday as wind blew away ash spewed out by a volcano, giving airlines a window to get tourists out while authorities stepped up efforts to get thousands of villagers to move to safety. Operations at the airport - the second-busiest in Indonesia - have been disrupted since the weekend when Mount Agung, in east Bali, began belching out huge clouds of smoke and ash, and authorities warned of an  imminent threat  of a major eruption.  Bali s international airport started operating normally,  air traffic control provider AirNav said in a statement, adding that operations resumed at 2:28 p.m. (0628 GMT). The reopening of the airport, which is about 60 km (37 miles) away from Mount Agung, followed a downgrade in an aviation warning to one level below the most serious, with the arrival of more favorable winds.  We really hope that we actually get a flight, maybe today or tomorrow, to get back home,  said tourist Nathan James, from the Australian city of Brisbane, waiting at the airport. A large plume of white and grey ash and smoke hovered over Agung on Wednesday, after night-time rain partially obscured a fiery glow at its peak. President Joko Widodo begged villagers living in a danger zone around the volcano to move to emergency centers. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the disaster mitigation agency said about 43,000 people had heeded advice to take shelter, but an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 people were living in the zone. The decision to resume flights followed an emergency meeting at the airport, when authorities weighing up weather conditions, tests and data from AirNav and other groups. Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 later showed there were flights departing and arriving at the airport although its general manager said if the wind changed direction the airport could be closed again at short notice. Agung looms over eastern Bali to a height of just over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet). Its last major eruption in 1963 killed more than 1,000 people and razed several villages. Ash coated cars, roofs and roads to the southeast of the crater on Wednesday and children wore masks as they walked to school. Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIAL.SI) said it would resume flights while Australia s Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX) said it and budget arm Jetstar would run 16 flights to Australia on Thursday to ferry home 3,800 stranded customers. Singapore Airlines and SilkAir were seeking approval to operate additional flights on Thursday, while budget offshoot Scoot said it would cease offering land and ferry transport to the city of Surabaya, on Java island, as it resumed flights to Bali. Virgin Australia plans to operate up to four recovery flights to Denpasar on Thursday.   As the volcanic activity remains unpredictable, these flights may be canceled at short notice,  it said on its website. The head of the weather agency at Bali airport, Bambang Hargiyono, said winds had begun to blow from the north to south, carrying ash toward the neighboring island of Lombok. He said the wind was expected to shift toward the southeast  for the next three days , which should allow flights to operate. As many as 430 domestic and international flights had been disrupted on Wednesday. Authorities are urging villagers living up to 10 km (6 miles) from the volcano to move to emergency centers, but some are reluctant to leave homes and livestock.  Those in the 8- to 10-km radius must truly take refuge for safety,  Widodo told reporters.  There must not be any victims.

"ADEN/GENEVA (Reuters) - The Saudi-led military coalition fighting against Yemen s Houthi movement reopened a land border crossing, partly easing a blockade imposed earlier this week, but aid agencies warned of famine and a health catastrophe if other ports stay shut.  The coalition said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports in Yemen to stem the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran, after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital Riyadh. The al Wadea border crossing, linking Saudi Arabia with territory in eastern Yemen controlled by the Saudi-backed government, was reopened on Thursday, a Yemeni official and witnesses said, letting food and other supplies across. The United Nations has said that a total blockade of Yemen could cause a famine that could kill millions. The government-held southern port of Aden was reopened on Wednesday, but ports in Houthi-held areas are still shut. The Houthis, drawn mainly from Yemen s Zaidi Shi ite minority and allied to long-serving former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, control much of the country including the capital San aa. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have been waging war against them on behalf of the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, based in Aden. The Saudis and their allies say the Houthis get weapons from their arch-foe, Iran. Iran denies arming the Houthis and blames the conflict in Yemen on Riyadh. Yemen s stocks of fuel and vaccines will run out in a month unless the Saudi-led coalition allows aid into the blockaded port of Hodeidah and the airport at San aa, UNICEF s representative in the country said on Friday. Meritxell Relano, speaking by phone to reporters in Geneva, said fuel prices had risen 60 percent and there were urgent concerns about a diphtheria outbreak, as well as food shortages because of the port closure.  The situation that was already catastrophic is just getting worse,  she said.  The impact of this is unimaginable in terms of health and diseases.  After two years of civil war, Yemen has 7 million people on the brink of famine and has had 900,000 suspected cholera cases in the past six months.  United Nations aid chief Mark Lowcock said on Wednesday that if the coalition did not allow humanitarian aid access to Yemen, it would cause  the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims.  The cholera epidemic had abated in recent weeks with the number of cases slowing amid a major push to fight the disease. But the World Health Organization said the progress could be reversed by the blockade.  If the closure is not stopped in the coming days, we may see that the progress is stopped,  WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a briefing in Geneva.  We can see even more cases and more deaths as a result of not being able to get access to people.  The closure of Hodeidah port prevented a ship setting sail from Djibouti with 250 tonnes of WHO medical supplies on Wednesday. Trauma kits in particular are running short.   If the hostilities continue and the ports remain closed, we will not be able to perform life-saving surgeries or provide basic healthcare,  Chaib said.  Germany will double its aid to UNICEF for Yemen to 20 million euros this year to help deal with looming famine, bringing its total annual aid to Yemen to 70 million, a spokeswoman for the development ministry said on Friday.  The suffering of the people in Yemen is inconceivable and it threatens to become much worse,  Development Minister Gerd Mueller told Passauer Neue Presse newspaper.  We must act now to prevent the death by starvation of millions of women, children and men.  ",1
"Right-ing paranoid whackjob Pat Boone has declared SNL is now venerating Satan, because of a parody skit they ran called  God is a Boob Man.  The skit was making some light-hearted humor at recent attempts to pass anti-LGBT laws in many states. The skit is absolutely hilarious and is a parody of other recent Christian movie trailers for such films as  God s not dead. It isn t clear how Boone saw the skit since he clearly hates SNL and shouldn t be watching it as a result. Perhaps he watches it just to get outraged. He certainly did get upset, though, when he took it upon himself to Godsplain God to the rest of us:God is not thin-skinned. But he does demand reverence. If you have any brains at all you don t pitch yourself against someone who created all things, the God of the Bible. They don t have to apologize to Christians [but] when you come against God and the Holy Spirit who are one and the same, you are bringing upon yourself eternal condemnation. Source: Right Wing WatchBoone went on to not only accuse SNL of being supporters of Satan, but he also outed SNL as a secret Jew-hating enterprise as well: Something can be devilishly funny, but this skit is diabolical. God has only one real enemy   Satan. Satan ridicules faith, and they re taking Satan s side. They re also ridiculing me and the film, telling impressionable young people not to see it because it s ridiculous. Then they throw in that the lawyer is Jewish to make the Christian look even worse, but it s just anti-Semitic. Source: Fox NewsYeah, he sure nailed it. Saturday Night Live is secretly anti-Jew. Just think about how stupid that sounds for a few moments.Then, to prove that he s a couple cans short of a six-pack, Boone said he didn t feel that SNL needed to apologize to Christians  followed a few moments later by him demanding that SNL apologizes to Christians. He literally real-time flip-flopped.Boone even went so far as to suggest that gay people should be offended at SNL for being  portrayed as more bigoted than Christians.  Notice he said  more  bigoted. He literally admitted that Christians like him are bigoted, by using the word  more. As if this wasn t embarrassing enough, the producer of  God s Not Dead 2,  (they actually made 2 of these?) Michael Scott, also complained that SNL is not portraying his movie  accurately  proving that he has absolutely NO CLUE how parody or satire works.Scott also chimed in with another incredibly funny comment, saying that parody like the SNL skit  goes too far  and  can cause divisions  among us.Really? Anti-LGBT/Pro-discrimination law doesn t go too far, and bigoted irrational hate doesn t cause divisions. But, a parody skit on SNL is the great doom of humanity. You really couldn t intentionally make up something that sounds as stupid as the things fundie Christians say naturally, these days.Featured image via Fox News screen capture",0
"The Trump administration has been getting absolutely pummeled for its refusal to acknowledge climate change, even as it becomes more obvious in our surroundings.On Monday, CNN s Jim Acosta tore Trump s Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, apart in front of everyone for the administration s ignorance. Acknowledging the fact that several massive hurricanes have been ravaging the United States, Acosta cornered Bossert, asking him if Trump and his administration  saw a connection between climate change and homeland security and that the frequency and intensity of powerful storms like Harvey and Irma can pose a problem for future administrations  and if the storms were  giving the administration some pause when it comes to the issue of climate change and homeland security. Bossert was almost beside himself as he said: Causality s something outside of my ability to analyze right now. We continue to take seriously the climate change, not the cause of it, but the things that we observe. Then, Acosta nailed him and the entire Trump administration for their stupidity and ignorance: When you see three category 4 hurricanes all on the same map at the same time, does the thought occur to you,  Jeez, you know, maybe there is something to this climate change thing and its connection to powerful hurricanes?  Or do you just separate the two and say,  Boy, these are a lot of hurricanes coming our way? Bossert, nearly crumbling in front of the entire room of reporters, responded: There is a cyclical nature to the hurricane seasons and I thank the scientists for their forecast on this particular one. They were dead on that this would be a stronger and more powerful hurricane season with slightly more than average large storms making landfall  So we ll have to do a larger trend analysis at a later date. Trump s administration is being challenged by the obvious evidence for climate change, and now they re being called out for it. No one can ignore what is currently happening in our environment, and the enormous impact it will have if Trump s administration doesn t wake up.

"Across the nation, mainly the South, there have been a number of  religious freedom  laws popping up. Now,  religious freedom  is actually code for  freedom to discriminate against gay people  as it once was  freedom to discriminate against black people  not too long ago.The state of Mississippi just passed one of the most discriminatory bills yet, but titled it  Religious Liberty Accommodations Act.  Which, is pretty accurate considering the state is trying to accommodate religious bigots and their discrimination. The bill HB 1523 has yet to be signed by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, but knowing his  religious liberty  history, he ll undoubtedly put pen to paper.Now, the bill itself is pretty damn blunt in its hatred towards the LGBT community. It states: The Mississippi Legislature finds the following:(a) Leading legal scholars concur that conflicts between same-sex marriage and religious liberty are real and should be addressed through legislation;(b) After the legalization of same-sex marriage, religious adoption and foster care agencies in Massachusetts, Illinois and the District of Columbia were forced to close because of their sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage etc. etc. First of all, who are these asshole  legal scholars  who clearly got their degree at Liberty  University  or somewhere similar.What is pretty damn interesting is the fact that the bill doesn t only attack the rights of the LGBT community, it also goes after heterosexual couples who aren t married yet. It stipulates that sex should only be between a man and a woman after marriage. The sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions protected by this act are the belief or conviction that:(a) Marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman;(b) Sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage; and(c) Male (man) or female (woman) refer to an individual s immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth. Yikes! There goes any and all premarital sex. I wonder how heterosexual people will feel with government entering into their bedrooms. So much for being anti-big government. This pretty much takes the cake on an infringement of personal rights all across the board. Not only does is purposefully discriminate against the LGBT community by taking away equal access, it also infringes upon the freedom of straight people to have sex before marriage.Last time I checked, the Bible isn t the Constitution, but hey .  religious freedom  amiright?!Featured Photo by M.

"Corruption is nothing new for Hillary and Bill. What is truly stunning is the mountain of evidence that clearly shows their criminal behavior has been going on for decades How did documents describing Hillary Clinton s role in the death of White House counsel Vince Foster vanish?Foster is believed to have shot himself with a .38 caliber revolver at Fort Marcy Park along the Potomac River on July 20, 1993From NewsMax April 4, 2001. Vince Foster s Gun  Serial Number Searched Before DeathWhen Vince Foster was found dead from an apparent gunshot wound to the head in 1993, the government was quick to write off the death as a suicide.That sat well with Bill Clinton and Vince s closest confidante, Hillary Rodham Clinton.For years, detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.Significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a .38 Colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in Vince s hand.The Park Police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913   and had no pedigree.Foster family members insisted neither Foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.Recently, a NewsMax.com reader named Craig Brinkley contacted us.Curious about the gun, Brinkley had filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FBI, asking details of requests on the gun s serial numbers with the NCIC   the National Crime Information Center.The NCIC keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.On March 23, 2001, the FBI responded to Brinkley s request.Serial number 356555, one of the numbers on the gun, was never searched, not by the FBI, the Park Police or by that  investigation  by Ken Starr.Serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun. Brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.That number was indeed searched by the Park Police, on the evening of Foster s death, more exactly at 22:45 EDT on July 20, 1993.Interestingly, searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year, before Foster s death, on March 3, March 7 and April 29.Was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable?We called Marilyn Walton at the FBI s Access Integrity Unit. She told us that the government does not disclose which law enforcement agencies requested a trace on the serial number. She said it could have been made by local or federal agencies who have access to the NCIC computer.She noted that serial numbers are often duplicated, and usually when a request is made, it includes additional information, such as the gun s make and model.In all four cases no such information was entered, just the number. Walton added that many guns share similar serial numbers.Is it a coincidence that in the year of Foster s death, four searches were conducted on the serial number found on the old gun   none ever before or after? Two former FBI agents involved in the investigation tell Daily Mail Online they issued reports linking Hillary s tirade to Foster s suicideIn interviewing Clinton White House aides and Foster s friends and family, the FBI found that a week before Foster s death, Hillary held a meeting at the White House with Foster and other top aides to discuss her proposed health care legislation.Hillary angrily disagreed with a legal objection Foster raised at the meeting and ridiculed him in front of his peers, former FBI agent Coy Copeland and former FBI supervisory agent Jim Clemente told me. Copeland was Starr s senior investigator and read the reports of other agents working for Starr.During the White House meeting, Hillary continued to humiliate Foster mercilessly, according to both former FBI agents, who spoke about the investigation for the first time. Hillary put him down really, really bad in a pretty good-size meeting,  Copeland says.  She told him he didn t get the picture, and he would always be a little hick town lawyer who was obviously not ready for the big time. Indeed, Hillary went so far as to blame Foster for all the Clintons  problems and to accuse him of failing them, according to Clemente, who was also assigned by the FBI to the Starr investigation and who probed the circumstances surrounding Foster s suicide. Foster was profoundly depressed, but Hillary lambasting him was the final straw because she publicly embarrassed him in front of others,  says Clemente. Hillary blamed him for failed nominations, claimed he had not vetted them properly, and said in front of his White House colleagues,  You re not protecting us  and  You have failed us,  Clemente says.  That was the final blow. After the White House meeting, Foster s behavior changed dramatically, the FBI agents found. Those who knew him said his voice sounded strained, he became withdrawn and preoccupied, and his sense of humor vanished. At times, Foster teared up. He talked of feeling trapped.On Tuesday, July 13, 1993, while having dinner with his wife Lisa, Foster broke down and began to cry. He said he was considering resigning.Archived material related to the case, housed at National Archives in College Park, Md. were examined by the author to no availAfter filing a Freedom of Information request, it was determined that the agents  reported have gone missing FBI agents  reports of interviews documenting that Hillary Clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor Vince Foster in front of White House aides triggered his suicide a week later are missing from where they should be filed at the National Archives, Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively.On two separate occasions, this author visited the National Archives and Records Service in College Park, Md., to review the reports generated by FBI agents assigned to investigate the 1993 death of Bill Clinton s deputy White House counsel.On the first visit, archivist David Paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the FBI reports of interviews conducted by FBI agents on Foster s death.On a second visit, archivist James Mathis provided what he said were those same documents.While the box contained dozens of FBI reports concerning Foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner, U.S. Park Police officers, and White House aides about the contents of Foster s office   the reports on Hillary Clinton s role in his death were absent.After filing a Freedom of Information request with the National Archives, Martha Murphy, the archives  public liaison, reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant FBI files, including those that had not been previously made public in response to FOIA requests. He examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster or the effects of a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster on Vince Foster s state of mind,  Murphy reported in an email. We did not limit ourselves to interviews by the two individuals [FBI agents] you mention. While Murphy said the archives searched for  the records that would be responsive to your request  and concluded that they could not be found, when asked for comment, John Valceanu, the archives  director of communications and marketing, said,  We do not agree with your conclusion that the records you requested are missing from the National Archives simply because we were unable to locate any responsive records in response to your request. While confirming that the records could not be located, Valceanu held out the possibility that the FBI interviews were not filed where they should have been and were somewhere else in the more than 3,000 boxes of records amounting to 7.5 million pages generated by the Starr investigation.This is not the first time documents related to the Clintons have apparently vanished from the National Archive.In March 2009, the archives found that an external hard drive from the Bill Clinton White House containing confidential documents was missing.When it could not be located, the inspector general s office announced that it had opened a criminal investigation.Offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to recovery of the hard drive, the archives asked that tips be reported to the Secret Service. At the time, the archives said it had a backup drive.Via: Daily Mail ",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will unveil a tax reform plan very soon and expects it will be approved by Congress this year whether a healthcare overhaul happens or not, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday. “It will be soon, very soon,” Mnuchin told a conference on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. Mnuchin said the Treasury was working on tax reform options “day and night” but he gave few specifics. “It will be sweeping, it will be significant and it will create a lot of economic growth,” he said. President Donald Trump campaigned on promises to lower taxes and boost economic growth. Trump, who took office in January, suffered a setback last month when the Republican-controlled Congress pulled a proposal to overhaul health care rules that would have generated savings for public coffers. Trump has since said the administration will continue trying to replace health care legislation enacted by his predecessor, Barack Obama, though Mnuchin said tax reform will move forward even if health laws stay the same. “Whether health care gets done or health care doesn’t get done, we’re going to get tax reform done,” he said, Trump’s tax plan would lower rates but most of the revenue lost under that plank of the reform would be gained back by boosting economic growth, Mnuchin said. “The plan will pay for itself with growth.” ",1
"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Greens said on Wednesday that any coalition government they join would have to agree to make carmakers introduce mechanical changes to engine and exhaust systems to cut toxic emissions. Transport is among the policy areas being thrashed out in talks taking place between Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, who are aiming to form a coalition by Christmas.  The parties are discussing all policy areas before launching detailed negotiations. While the atmosphere has improved in recent days, there have been few actual deals, with immigration and climate change among the biggest sticking points. The Greens  demand on carmakers would go further than software fixes so far agreed between politicians and German car bosses to help repair the industry s badly damaged reputation. The future of Germany s mighty car industry, the country s biggest exporter and provider of some 800,000 jobs, is a tricky area as it tries to recover from the diesel emissions testing scandal which broke at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) two years ago. Despite public concern and planned diesel bans in countries including France and Britain in coming decades, German lawmakers have not yet dared ask the same of its carmakers, such as BMW, VW, Daimler and Porsche who have invested heavily in diesel. In August, politicians and car bosses agreed to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution and avoid bans on polluting vehicles but they stopped short of committing to more expensive hardware modifications. That may have to change if the Greens share power.      We won t meet our targets of getting cleaner air in city centers with software upgrades alone,  Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens, said as he headed into the talks.  There must also be hardware solutions.  Ozdemir said the auto industry was going through the biggest transformation process in its history and the car had to be reinvented to make it emission-free and more automated. Public transport must also be expanded, he added. The conservative bloc, comprising Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavaria s Christian Social Union (CSU), oppose any demand to ban the combustion engine from 2030.  ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican lawmakers told the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday that they want to question three senior FBI officials about an investigation of then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state. The lawmakers, who are leading a joint probe into the Clinton investigation, said in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, that they wanted to speak with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, FBI Chief of Staff Jim Rybicki and FBI counsel Lisa Page beginning on Thursday. The FBI declined to comment on the letter and referred reporters to the Justice Department. The request to meet the FBI officials for “transcribed interviews” was made after Republicans obtained more than 300 text messages sent last year between Page and FBI agent Peter Strzok critical of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The text messages called him an “idiot” and “a loathsome human,” among other things, according to copies reviewed by Reuters. Strzok later worked for Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election and ties between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Moscow denies U.S. allegations of election meddling and Trump denies any campaign collusion.  Strzok, who helped lead the investigation of Clinton’s handling of classified material, was removed from Mueller’s team after the special counsel became aware of the texts critical of Trump. Republican lawmakers have attacked Mueller, expressing concern about potential bias among his investigators. But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has testified to lawmakers that  he was “not aware” of any impropriety by Mueller’s team. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Representative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, are conducting a joint review of the FBI’s handling of the Clinton investigation. In their letter to Sessions and Rosenstein, they said they were looking into several decisions by the FBI during the Clinton investigation, including then-FBI Director James Comey’s decision not refer Clinton’s case for prosecution.

"But wait  the  first female president oh never mind, the Democrat party s gonna go with  diversity  and pick the old white guy. Because in the end, the Democrats don t really give a hoot about  diversity it all comes down to voting for freebies.According to PBS, Bernie Sanders is  gaining against Clinton in early polls.  Salon s Bill Curry believes  Hillary Clinton is going lose,  primarily because millions of voters longing for a truly progressive candidate will nominate Sanders. POLITICO explained recently that Early-state polls hint at a Bernie Sanders surge, a headline that was unthinkable only several months earlier. Yahoo s Meredith Shiner calls Sanders a  progressive social media star and pragmatic legislator  and states that  Sanders also has a much more substantial legislative history  than any GOP challenger. In Iowa, 1,100 people packed a gym to hear Bernie Sanders speak in May.In contrast, Team Hillary had an intimate business roundtable discussion with five  ordinary  Iowans. The only problem was that according to The Washington Post,  All five were selected to attend her events.  In fact, Clinton s  staged roundtables  were attended by a total of 13 Iowans, picked by either the campaign or the host.Therefore, a paradigm shift has taken place. Many Iowans drove 50 miles to hear Sanders speak in Des Moines, primarily because Bernie Sanders has surpassed Clinton as the ideal choice for Democratic nominee. Regarding electability, Sanders has also surpassed Clinton as the realistic choice for Democratic nominee in the minds of many voters, because as one Salon piece illustrates, Hillary  just doesn t get it. When it comes to everything from immigration to climate change and economic issues (most Americans side with Democrats, according to Pew research and other data) some writers believe that Democrats  can nominate a ham sandwich and win the presidency.  Although once thought of as an impossibility, a closer look at the electoral map shows why Bernie Sanders could realistically defeat any GOP challenger. If voters around the country still care about middle class economics, the federal budget, trade and other hot button issues in 2016, Sanders has a legitimate chance to win. Also, since Sanders isn t tied to Obama fatigue like Hillary Clinton, it s quite possible the Vermont Senator re-energizes an America that just recently decided the Confederate flag doesn t represent its value system.According to a POLITICO piece titled The 2016 Results We Can Already Predict,  Assuming the lean, likely, and safe Democratic states remain loyal to the party, the nominee need only win 23 of the 85 toss-up electoral votes.  Therefore, there s no need to jettison cherished values for the sake of pragmatism; those days are over. Senator Bernie Sanders, known in Washington and throughout the nation as an advocate for middle class Americans, veterans, the environment, and other cherished causes can win crucial electoral votes just as easily as Hillary Clinton.Finally, perhaps the biggest reason Sanders is surging is because he s a genuine person with real beliefs, while others become chameleons when votes and public image are at stake. It s important to note that Hillary Clinton just recently  evolved  on gay marriage and in 2004, Clinton s speech (forward to 0:22 on the Slate video or read the transcript of her passionate defense of marriage between only a man and woman) highlighted her views on the  sacred bond  of marriage:Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY):  I believe marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman .a fundamental bedrock principle that it exists between a man and woman, going back into the midst of history, as one of the founding, foundational institutions of history and humanity and civilization. And that it s primary principle role during those milennia has been the raising and socializing of children for the society into which they are to become adults.  According to The Atlantic, Clinton s stance remained unchanged for years, and  she also opposed gay marriage as recently as 2013, long after a majority of Americans already held a more gay-friendly position. In terms of identity, Hillary Clinton might be a liberal according to fivethirtyeight.com, yet their analysis gives her a free pass on war, gay marriage, and other issues liberals had championed before they were popular. Adhering to polls is fine, but the words  poll driven,  not  progressive,  come to mind for someone with this type of persona. If one s views on war and foreign policy are enough for The New York Times to publish an article titled Are neocons getting ready to ally with Hillary Clinton?, then Bernie Sanders becomes an even better candidate for people opposed to never-ending American counterinsurgency wars. Clinton might say she was duped by faulty intelligence, but Bernie Sanders had enough intelligence and wisdom to vote against the Iraq war back in 2003.Via: Huffington Post",0
"Last night, Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination. Yes yes yes Feel the Bern, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is evil, Superdelegates are unfair, Hillary must have cheated, etc. etc. etc. Aside from all of that, it s clear Clinton has kept the Obama coalition more or less intact and that s going to land her the nomination. Without the support of the black community and non-millennial voters, Bernie s path to victory is extremely narrow and that s before you factor in the Superdelegates. If you don t believe me, then you should believe Nate Silver s fivethirtyeight.com, which has been the gold standard in political statistical analysis for the last several years.So Sanders should just quit and go home, right? Good lord, no! Even though he s losing the primaries, he s winning the debate and the Democratic Party still needs him. Badly.Love him or kind of like him (no one really hates him on the left), Sanders is correct when he says the Democratic Party is a little too cozy with Big Money. The problem is that while the corporate media loves LOVES to pretend that Democrats are just as far to the left as the GOP is to the right, that s total bullshit. The Democratic Party is comfortably to the left on social issues but center left (and just barely) when it comes to economics. This is a serious issue when it comes to making the necessary compromises with Republicans to get anything done. Any middle ground sits squarely to the right (which, of course, was the entire point of Republicans go so far to the fringe in the first place).What Bernie does, and does brilliantly, is drag the entire process to the left   and the Democratic Party with him. He ll never say it out loud, of course, but Bernie never really intended to win the primaries. His entire campaign is designed to influence politics on the left. This is heresy to the Bernie True Believers but let s be honest, Bernie has kept the Democratic Party at arm s length for decades, constantly poking at them like a gadfly. Winning the Superdelegates necessary to win the nomination was never an achievable goal and he s not even trying. Why? Because winning the election was not the goal, showing the Democratic Party that they can openly embrace Democratic Socialism and not be immediately burned at the stake was.And it s working. Very VERY well.In case you haven t noticed, Bernie Sanders openly advocating Socialism has not sent the country into shock. The corporate media keeps trying (poorly) to attack Sanders over this but he s so persistent and consistent with his message that the media s You re a Commie!  nonsense is getting drowned out. On top of that, the negative connotations of Socialism are completely lost on Millennials, AKA, the group of people that will be controlling politics in a decade or so.Bernie will continue to fight tooth and nail for every state he can because the higher his delegate count, the stronger his message is despite the lead Clinton has and will continue to hold even without the Superdelegates. When he concedes sometime in the summer (and he s got the war chest to go that far with ease), he will urge his followers to support Clinton and the Democratic Party but to continue to hold their feet to the fire. Clinton will have campaigned further to the left that she would have normally and for long enough that moving too far back to the center in the general election will hurt more than help.Like Obama, Sanders is playing a long game. He may not even be around to see the seeds he s planted take root but as long as he pulls Hillary and Democratic politics to the left (and he has), he s already won even if he s not the nominee.Featured image courtesy of Michael Vadon via wikimedia commons.",0
"TAPA, Estonia (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May urged the European Union on Friday to respond in kind to proposals she set out in Italy last week that sought to unlock Brexit talks, saying forming a new partnership was in the bloc s interest as well.  Speaking to Reuters in Estonia after meeting British troops, May said she believed the speech in Florence a week ago had given new momentum to the troubled divorce negotiations and had seen signs to suggest it had broken the deadlock. But she did not say whether she thought it was enough to     move the talks on to a discussion of the future relationship by an October summit after EU negotiators said again this week that not enough progress had been made.  A week ago I gave a speech in Florence which set out how we have made good progress so far, I thought we could make further progress and moving on to looking at the future deep and special relationship and partnership that we want to build with the European Union when the UK has left the EU,  she said.  I made that speech to give momentum to the talks and I think we have seen that being shown in the talks that have taken place this week and further progress has been made.  Following the latest round of talks this week, the EU s top negotiator said May s speech had created a  new dynamic , but more progress was needed to move to the next phase of discussions. May, weakened by a June election when she lost her Conservative Party s majority, hopes to use the informal summit in Estonia to talk to EU leaders about Brexit, and to underline Britain s role in European security to try to win goodwill. Standing beside French President Emmanuel Macron and Estonia s Juri Ratas, she chatted to some of the 800 troops Britain has deployed at a military base in Tapa, northern Estonia, as part of NATO s moves to defend against a newly assertive Russia on the EU s border.  By focusing on defense in Tallinn, May will want to show that Britain has something to offer its European neighbors and will say she is ready to share British expertise - including through the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) - to help EU nations build up their own cyber-security capability. That, she hopes, could bolster her argument for pushing the Brexit talks forward.   I set out what I thought was the future deep and special partnership we can build with the EU and I look for the speech that I set out for that being reciprocated in proposals that the EU will come forward with,  she said.

"Donald Trump has been notorious for touting poll numbers that look good for him. During the campaign, whenever he d careen into one of his many controversies and the numbers dipped, he and his mouthpieces would reference junk polls to show that people still loved The Donald. Of course, any poll that can be voted in a million times online is bogus. However, factual data isn t bogus, and that data does not look good for Trump right now. In fact, a new poll shows that way more Americans want Trump removed from office than the number of people who think he s doing a good job.According to new data from Public Policy Polling, 47 percent of Americans see Donald Trump as the incompetent, dangerously unstable buffoon he is, and want him impeached posthaste. On the other hand, just 37 percent believe he is actually a good president. That isn t surprising; after all, the slavish, blind devotion of his mouthbreathing base has not been a secret for nigh on two years now.On the other side of said insane base, there were marches around the nation for the holiday weekend demanding Trump s removal and protesting his administration and their policies. Further, more Democrats are becoming emboldened by these numbers and are actually drafting articles of impeachment. One such Democrat is Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA). Speaking in his home district in Los Angeles, Rep. Sherman egged the anti-Trump crowd on, saying: We have to act now to protect our country from abuse of power and impulsive, ignorant incompetence. At this declaration, the crowd borrowed from Trump s own base, and shouted back:  LOCK HIM UP! Of course, there s one little difference between Trump s base and the Democrats   there s PLENTY of evidence to suggest that Trump is a criminal, while there is absolutely none to suggest the same about Hillary Clinton.Of course, there will be no impeachment until the Democrats take back the House of Representatives, and there will be no invocation of the 25th Amendment to remove and unfit  president  from office for the sake of the nation. Therefore, we MUST turn out in 2018, and make sure we control both chambers of Congress. That s the only way we get real, credible Congressional investigations into the Russia ordeal, and it s the only way we get rid of Trump and his criminal administration.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0
"Breibart editor Milo Yiannopoulos is the obnoxious little twerp who got banned from Twitter for inciting his fans to viciously attack comedian Leslie Jones in an effort to humiliate her.Now karma has finally turned the tables on Yiannopoulos.During an interview with ABC s Terry Moran that will air on Nightline this Friday, Yiannopoulos was the one who got humiliated this time as Moran took this asshole who has the maturity of a 12-year-old boy to school.Yiannopoulos began by calling himself a  virtuous troll  who is  doing God s work. If Leslie Jones were right here, would you say,  You look like a dude ?  Moran asked. Yeah, probably,  Yiannopoulos replied. You would say that to her?  a disgusted Moran said.Once again, Yiannopoulos has zero remorse for his ugly attack and said he would do it again, which led to Moran smacking the Breitbart bully down. Then you re an idiot,  Moran told him.Yiannopoulos argued that he is not responsible for what his fans do even though it was his sexism and hate that made Jones a target for harassment in the first place. Does Justin Bieber have an obligation to his fans? I m sorry for being popular. But I am not responsible for what 350,000 people on the Internet say. I m responsible for what I say. Yeah, and what you said incited your fans to attack as if they were your own personal army of Internet trolls. If Justin Beiber launched a Twitter tirade against Selena Gomez that resulted in his fans attacking her, he would be responsible for it. Just like Yiannopoulos is responsible for the attack on Jones.Words have consequences and Yiannopoulos is finding that out the hard way.Moran responded by putting Yiannopoulis in his place with an epic smackdown that is incredibly enjoyable to watch. You re going to go after somebody s body to denigrate their ideas? What grade are you in? Are you a 13-year-old boy? Because somebody doesn t have a weight that you think is proper? That s revolting. And Yiannopoulos responded by being a misogynist asshole. I ll tell you what s revolting. What s revolting is the body positivity movement. What s revolting is this idea now that you can tell women that they ll be healthy at any size. Here s the video via YouTube:Trolls like Yiannopoulos should be banned from using the Internet entirely. He should not have a platform to bully others and spread his hate. And of course, he s a supporter of Donald Trump, which makes him even more of a prick. But you can bet that sexist trolls like Yiannopoulos will become even more emboldened if the Republican nominee should win in November, which makes it even more important that he lose by a humiliating landslide.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
"In a stunning last minute power grab by the Obama administration with just 14 days left in his Presidency, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement this evening officially declaring state election systems to be  critical infrastructure.  The statement from DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson defines  election infrastructure  as  storage facilities, polling places, centralized vote tabulations locations, voter registration databases, voting machines  and all  other systems  to manage the election process so pretty much everything.I have reached this determination so that election infrastructure will, on a more formal and enduring basis, be a priority for cybersecurity assistance and protections that the Department of Homeland Security provides to a range of private and public sector entities. By  election infrastructure,  we mean storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations locations used to support the election process, and information and communications technology to include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and report and display results on behalf of state and local governments. Given the vital role elections play in this country, it is clear that certain systems and assets of election infrastructure meet the definition of critical infrastructure, in fact and in law,  Johnson stated.  Particularly in these times, this designation is simply the right and obvious thing to do. The designation  allows for information to be withheld from the public when state, local and private partners meet to discuss election infrastructure security   potentially injecting secrecy into an election process that s traditionally and expressly a transparent process,  according to the AP. U.S. officials say such closed door conversations allow for frank discussion that would prevent bad actors from learning about vulnerabilities. DHS would also be able to grant security clearances when appropriate and provide more detailed threat information to states. The announcement of a federal takeover of the electoral process follows a report from several intelligence agencies also released Friday which purports the Russian government worked to influence the outcome of the 2016 US election.The AP reports several states in recent months opposed the move fearing  the designation would lead to increased federal regulation or oversight on the many decentralized and locally run voting systems across the country. At least one member of the US Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group, Georgia Secretary of State Brian P. Kemp, stated he opposed the measure claiming  more federal oversight could make systems more vulnerable and could make protected records more accessible,  the AP writes.Kemp reportedly called the move  a federal overreach into a sphere constitutionally reserved for the states  on a conference call with Johnson Thursday, and said the designation  smacks of partisan politics. Examples of election infrastructure include storage facilities, voter registration databases, voting locations, voting machines and other systems designed to manage the election process, the AP notes.  For entire story: InfowarsDecember 18, 2016   Georgia s secretary of state has claimed the Department of Homeland Security tried to breach his office s firewall and has issued a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson asking for an explanation.Brian Kemp issued a letter to Johnson on Thursday after the state s third-party cybersecurity provider detected an IP address from the agency s Southwest D.C. office trying to penetrate the state s firewall. According to the letter, the attempt was unsuccessful.And now, Channel 2 Investigative Reporter Aaron Diamond has learned two more states  election agencies have confirmed suspected cyberattacks linked to the same U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP address as last month s massive attack in Georgia.Watch here:Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp recently told Politico it is nothing more than an attempt to  subvert the Constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security. During an earlier interview with the site Nextgov, Kemp warned:  The question remains whether the federal government will subvert the Constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security.  Kemp told POLITICO he sees a  clear motivation from this White House  to expand federal control, citing Obama s health care law, the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation and the increased role of the Education Department in local schools.To some election officials, this sounds like the first stage of a more intrusive plan. I think it s kind of the nose under the tent,  said Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos, a Democrat.  What I think a lot of folks get concerned about [is] when the federal government says,  Well, look, we re not really interested in doing that, but we just want to give you this,  and then all of a sudden this leads to something else.  Meanwhile, Kemp continued on by noting that  this administration only has 15 days left in its term  and to make such a critical decision during the 11th hour  smacks of partisan politics. But we re sure it s nothing, Obama doesn t really strike us as the type to play the  partisan politics  game.  Zero Hedge",0
"While speaking in front of United States servicemembers at a recent USO event with both President Obama and Vice President Biden, David Letterman made a joke that many of us would really like to be a reality.

"A police officer in Atlanta has been caught on camera breaking the leg of a man during an altercation over a single tomato at a Walmart store.According to reports and the video evidence, Tyrone Carnegay is approached by Officer Trevor King as he goes to leave the store, after a manager accused him of stealing a single tomato. Before any apparent reaction from Carnegay, Officer King begins beating him repeatedly with his baton. Carnage hits the deck without retaliating.The beating was so severe that Officer King broke two bones in Carnegay s leg and ruptured an artery. He needed to be hospitalized and have a titanium rod implanted in his leg. He also remained handcuffed throughout his time at hospital, despite being the victim and not the perpetrator of an attack.He was later charged with simple battery against police and willful obstruction of law enforcement officers   and jailed for three days.It wasn t until the video of the attack was produced, along with the receipt for Carnegay s purchase of the tomato (which was in his pocket the entire time), that Carnegay was released and the charges dropped.Had Officer King simply asked him to produce the receipt before attacking Carnegay, the matter would have been cleared up in a moments. He is now taking up legal proceedings against local law enforcement for the injuries he sustained in the brutal attack. He told WSB-TV: As he s grabbing me, he s beating me at the same time, [saying]  Get on the ground, Beating me at the same time. Carnegay s attorney, Craig Jones added: The officer went into Robocop mode and beat the crap out of him, Officer King needed only to ask a simple question of Tyrone Carnegay, to establish whether or not he had purchased the tomato. Instead, he opted to launch a frenzied attack with zero provocation. If anyone should be languishing behind bars right now, it is him.Featured image via screengrab",0
"As Donald Trump makes the downhill run to Cleveland this July, those loyal to the Republican party who see it as a viable political entity for the next century rather than the cesspool of racism, hypocrisy and hate run by the wealthy that it is are trying desperately to save their beloved sham. America is divided. Politically we are either in favor of progress and societal evolution or we re with the rich guys who couldn t care less, but all life matters and poor people are stealing your paycheck.It really is that simple. You don t hear about plans to save and revive the Democratic party; our numbers grow as people learn to read and use Google. How many times can a person with any intelligence land back on a  pants on fire  designation for yet another conservative  news  crock of sh*t before they figure out the GOP is a scam?? Anyway, those people who are tried and true Republicans who know that Donald Trump is about to be the laughing-stock of the nation when actual debate issues come up and the Republican party will pay dearly.As he alienates more and more groups of people, trying desperately to get elected exclusively by angry white males, the establishment Republicans charged with seeing their party into the future can t endorse it. Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse are kicking around the idea of a third-party run, not by them of course, but the inevitable result of splitting the conservative vote is a Clinton win. It looks like the inevitable result of a straight Trump versus Clinton matchup ends with a Clinton win as well, so those still interested in seeing anyone but Donald Trump represent the Republican party in November are beginning to think of longshot last plays. The #NeverTrump movement has come up with one, and if properly put into place, it could change electoral history.In order for someone to win the White House, they must receive 270 electoral votes. Democrats have a distinct lead in electoral votes before polling begins, so the GOP always faces an uphill battle to begin with. If you want to see a third-party candidate in the White House you don t have to run one in the election, you just have to make sure neither of the candidates from the major party gets to 270. What happens then? According to the Constitution, the House of Representatives will then appoint Paul Ryan or Mittens or Jeb Bush or whoever else they feel works best for their political agenda, by a simple majority vote.So how do you keep the candidates from getting enough electoral votes? The idea from #NeverTrump is simple enough in theory: Run an influential person in each state and only in that state. Take enough electoral votes that way and nobody gets to 270. Think about it What if enough people in Florida decided that they would vote for Jeb Bush because neither of the major party candidates appealed to them. They know Jeb; they trust him. If he s on the ticket there s a darned good reason. In 2000 that by itself would have sent the presidential election to a vote, not restricted to the candidates on the ballot, in the congressional lower chamber. If that happens this year, Speaker Ryan will get to appoint his first president.The #NeverTrump movement is more than likely futile because in the end the Republicans are gonna batten down the hatches and ride the Trump wave all the way to historical comedy.Featured image by Matt Mills McKnight/Getty Images",0
"21st Century Wire says The business of defense.In order to sustain mammoth defense sector based in North America, the U.S. relies on international procurement and sales of both new and close-out military industrial goods.Although a relatively small country in size, Lebanon is a key position on the Middle East chessboard, and could one day become an emerging military market for US defense corporations. In Washington DC, however, the topic of US military aid the Lebanon is a relatively hushed affair because of the Israeli Lobby s influence over US lawmakers.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - A defector s treatment for critical injuries suffered during a dramatic dash from North Korea has highlighted a shortage of South Korean trauma doctors and again underscored Seoul s lack of preparedness in the event of hostilities with Pyongyang. The defector, identified only by his family name of Oh, was shot at least four times by his former comrades during his daring escape into South Korea last week. American military helicopters flew the wounded soldier not to one of the many hospitals in Seoul, closer to the border, but to the Ajou University trauma center an hour south of the capital. The center, and its lead surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee, have been thrust into the spotlight amid a push for more trauma facilities and specialist doctors in a country still technically at war and where preventable trauma death rates are already amongst the highest in the OECD.      An official at South Korea s Ministry of Health said more than 30 percent of people who suffered fatal trauma injuries last year could have survived if they had access to proper, timely treatment. That s far higher than the 10 to 15 percent in places such as the United States and Japan.  Although 133 surgeons are currently entitled to perform trauma surgery, I highly doubt that all of them can actually perform,  said Park Chan-yong, general affairs manager of the Korean Society of Traumatology.  Many of them just gained the rights, but never had practiced this kind of surgery.  By Friday, attention sparked by the defector s case had prompted nearly 200,000 South Koreans to join a petition asking the presidential Blue House to boost funding for Lee s trauma center, one of just nine in the country. During increased tensions this year with heavily armed North Korea, Seoul has faced criticism over a lack of preparation for major emergencies, with many bomb shelters, for example, laying forgotten and unstocked with food or water.  The government has launched programs to raise awareness, but public emergency drills often fail to attract much response. Despite the apparent need for specialists, Lee said he has faced  ignorance,  including from some doctors who complained he was showing off with new techniques, since returning from training in the United States in 2003.  I had to explain whenever I met new doctors here, what a trauma surgeon was. Every day,  he said.  Often, trauma medicine is not seen as attractive or lucrative as other fields, said Park.  Residents and medical students avoid coming to traumatology, because there is no hope and no dream.   The South Korean government says it recognizes the problem, and in 2014 set a goal of lowering its rate of preventable trauma fatalities to levels closer to those of other OECD countries by 2020. But with a shortage of funding, only half of a planned 17 regional trauma centers have been built so far, a health ministry official said. Germany, for example, has less than twice the population of South Korea, but 10 times as many operational trauma centers. South Korea s strict gun control laws also mean there are far fewer gunshot wounds like those suffered by the defector.  Between January 2012 and August 2017, 31 people were killed and 51 wounded by guns, according to the police. In comparison, in the United States, where Lee trained, more than 33,000 people die from gunshot wounds every year, according to annual averages of government data. However, the kinds of industrial accidents and car crashes commonly seen in South Korea can cause equally bad injuries, Lee said.  In South Korea, roughly speaking, more than 90 percent of trauma victims are brought to the hospital in less than an hour,  Lee said.  However, frequently, they are put in emergency rooms for a while, sometime for hours, to get proper care.  Lee has made a name for himself and the Ajou trauma center, in part by cultivating a close relationship with the American and South Korean militaries, making it an obvious choice for the defector s treatment. Lee said his fascination with the American medical evacuation crews and the techniques he learned in the United States have led him to push for a series of new additions at the trauma center, including a recently completed roof-top helipad with flashing neon messages in English for American pilots.  U.S. military air crews, however, have yet to obtain Pentagon permission to use the new helipad, Lee said. The arrival of the North Korean defector has brought Lee a new round of criticism for appearing to seek attention,  including from one lawmaker, a charge he says is unfounded. But it has also highlighted the need for more funding for his center and more trauma facilities in South Korea.  To those who get only 10, 20 minutes of sleep while working to save emergency room patients, to those who only get to go home once a week or not even that   we should not be criticizing them but rather, discuss how to resolve problems within the system,  the petition submitted to the Blue House said.

" The Swedish identity will be wiped out in 20-30 years. This is sadly, a look into the future for all of Europe As a current resident of Sweden, I sometimes find myself questioning my own sanity. All these problems I blog about are right there in the open for anyone to see and getting worse by the year, yet media and politicians act as if everything is hunky-dory. Most people on the street also appears to be completely oblivious to details like the enormous increase of burning cars in the ghettos, the 1472% increase in rapes and the ever bolder gangs choking their enclaves with drugs and violence.So I find myself wondering, am I missing something? Why aren t people reacting? Is it really reasonable that so many are in a state of denial? Or am I somehow misinterpreting all this?That s why it s oddly reassuring that the neighboring Nordic countries are in the same boat. Denmark has voiced concerns about the utterly weak background check of immigrants from the middle east, fearing radical Islamists entering Sweden as asylum seekers with the intent of building Scandinavian terror cells. My very first post on this blog was about a Danish politician openly pleading for Sweden to come to its senses.Norway isn t too pleased either, and they dare speak openly about the problems brewing in the cities of their neighbor.In a new report called  Oslo 2022,  the Norwegian police explicitly use Sweden in general and the town of S dert lje as a warning example. This prompted Aftonposten, one of the major Norwegian newspapers, to do two articles on Sweden s out-of-control immigration.In the first part, Norwegian reporters traveled to S dert lje outside Stockholm. Entitled  We all live in the same town, but not in the same world,  the article chronicles a town in complete segregation where the immigrants gain ground every year and everyone who can escapes. Violence, drugs, lawlessness and decay eats away at the town like a cancer. Why is this allowed to happen?  the reporter asks. Because the Swedes are weak,  says 36-year old Simon Melkemichel.  The Swedish identity will be wiped out in 20-30 years. The second part is called  Sweden has lost control over their immigration  and has representatives for the Norwegian government comment on the fact that, well, Sweden has lost control over their immigration. What makes it noteworthy is the difference in tone compared to the Swedish political debate.As in Denmark, the Norwegian leftist worker s party have a very different view on immigration than the Swedish sister party Socialdemokraterna (currently in power). In Norway and Denmark, they make a point of restricting the inflow and checking the backgrounds carefully.In Sweden, there are literally no limits, and any background check beyond scratching the surface is considered racist and shut down by management as has been repeatedly revealed by bloggers like Merit Wager.Not surprisingly, the police report and the articles have ruffled quite a few feathers in Sweden s political and medial elite. But equally predictably, the Swedish response is not to acknowledge the problems, but to whine about the mean Norwegian pseudo-fascists having the gall to criticize Sweden s enlightened stance.While it doesn t do squat to fix anything, it s at least reassuring that I m not the one losing my mind.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson framed an embarrassing lapse on foreign affairs as simple human error on Thursday after he responded to a question about a flashpoint in the Syrian civil war by asking, “What is Aleppo?” The gaffe came during an MSNBC interview about the continuing battle for Syria’s biggest city, Aleppo, which has been divided for years into government and rebel sectors and has been in the news daily in recent weeks. “What would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo,” Johnson was asked.  “About Aleppo. And what is Aleppo?” he responded. “You’re kidding?” the MSNBC interviewer said.  “No,” Johnson said. “Aleppo is in Syria. ... It’s the epicenter of the refugee crisis,” the interviewer said.  “OK, got it. Got it,” Johnson said. The embarrassing exchange followed a forum on Wednesday night in which Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump sought to showcase their national security and defense credentials.  Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico, has been trying to turn the two major candidates’ low approval ratings to his advantage in the race to win the Nov. 8 election. However, he has just 8.6 support in the current average of opinion polls by website RealClearPolitics in a matchup with Clinton, Trump, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. While the Libertarian Party has long rejected U.S. military intervention abroad, the candidate’s failure to recognize one of the most troubled spots in the Middle East drew ridicule and prompted speculation that his campaign was essentially over.  Clinton, asked at a news conference about Johnson’s remarks, laughed and quipped, “You can look on the map and find Aleppo.” In a statement after the MSNBC interview, Johnson said the mistake showed he was human and explained that, when asked about Aleppo, he was thinking of an acronym and not the Syrian war. “Can I name every city in Syria? No. Should I have identified Aleppo? Yes. Do I understand its significance? Yes,” he said. In the 2012 presidential election, Johnson set a record for most votes won by a Libertarian candidate - about 1 percent of the popular vote - and was aiming to attract disaffected Republicans and Democrats to sustain steady growth in the party. The Libertarian agenda promotes civil liberties and a small-government agenda. Johnson has pledged to cut spending, stick to conservative fiscal policies and legalize marijuana. Appearing on ABC’s talk show “The View” later, Johnson reacted mildly to suggestions the gaffe would kill his campaign. “I guess people will have to make that judgment,” he said. ",1

"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thousands of people rallied for marriage equality in Australia s second-biggest city of Melbourne on Saturday ahead of a postal survey on same-sex marriage which could lead to its legalisation. Australia is one of the only developed English-speaking countries not to have legalised same-sex marriage, despite strong popular support and the backing of a majority of lawmakers. Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, of the opposition Labor Party, called on the conservative Liberal Party-led government to do more to ensure the debate did not turn ugly ahead of the postal survey next month.  I m particularly calling on the prime minister of Australia to speak out against any bile or hate speech that we might see in this campaign,  he told the rally. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last week urged supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage to show mutual respect as their campaigns turned increasingly vitriolic. [nL4N1LB1TJ] Rally organiser Anthony Wallace from activist group Equal Love said 15,000 people attended the event, making it one of the largest gay rights rallies in Australian history. Police declined to estimate the size of the crowd. The rally is an annual event, which this year began and ended at the Victorian State Library, where a mass same-sex wedding ceremony was held.  Australians will vote over several weeks from mid-September in the non-compulsory postal ballot on whether to legalise same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is supported by 61 percent of Australians, a 2016 Gallup opinion poll showed, but the issue has fractured the Turnbull government and damaged his standing with voters, now at a six-month low.

"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A New Zealand Labour government will still want to be part of the stalled Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal but only if it allows for foreigners to be banned from buying existing homes, opposition leader Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday. Labour, firming as the frontrunner ahead of the National government in a Sept. 23 election, wants to curb overseas buyers  home purchases in a bid to cool the housing market and make home ownership more affordable for New Zealanders. Foreigners with the right to live in New Zealand would be exempt from Labour s proposed ban, which would still be at odds with provisions in the TPP trade deal as well as New Zealand s free trade agreement with South Korea.  It is an agreement we want to be part of, but we also want to maintain our ability to legislate under our laws to protect what is an overheated housing market,  Ardern said.  We want to be in there but our housing bottom line is pretty firm for us,  she told New Zealand media. The original 12-member TPP, which aims to cut trade barriers in some of Asia s fastest-growing economies, was thrown into limbo in January when U.S. President Trump withdrew from the agreement. The remaining 11 members have said they remain committed to the deal, but implementation of the agreement linking 11 countries with a combined GDP of $12.4 trillion has stalled. Ardern, who has almost single-handedly changed Labour s election chances since becoming leader in August, has made home ownership a campaign focus. She has criticized National for failing to tackle a housing crisis during nine years in government, promising to build more affordable homes and to crack down on foreign speculators. Labour wants to reconsider New Zealand s role in the TPP if foreign investment provisions are not restricted. Banning foreign investment in existing homes would also mean having to renegotiate New Zealand s trading agreement with South Korea, although its free trade deal with China already provides for restrictions on foreign investment.  Korea has the same carve-out ... for themselves so they can restrict New Zealanders ... Australia has that same carve-out in their agreement with Korea, so we don t anticipate that would be a significant sticking point,  she said. National criticized Labour s plans to renegotiate the trade agreement with South Korea, describing it as an  ill-thought out and vague  policy. Support for Labour rose to 41.8 percent in the latest average of opinion polls, nudging above National s 41.1 percent. ",1
"Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.",0
"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian hacker arrested in Spain on a U.S. warrant said on Thursday he previously worked for President Vladimir Putin s United Russia party and feared he would be tortured and killed if extradited, RIA news agency reported. Peter Levashov was arrested while on holiday in Barcelona in April. U.S. prosecutors later charged him with hacking offences, accusing him of operating a network of tens of thousands of infected computers used by cyber criminals. Levashov s comments offered a rare glimpse into the relationship between cyber criminals and the Russian state. U.S. officials say Russian authorities routinely shield hackers from prosecution abroad before recruiting them for espionage work. Russian hackers have been under intense scrutiny since U.S. intelligence officials accused Moscow of interfering in last year s U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.   U.S. prosecutors are seeking a 52-year jail sentence and Levashov, who denies the charges against him, is fighting his extradition from Spain. He told a court in Madrid on Thursday that he had worked for the United Russia party for the last 10 years.  I collected different information about opposition parties and delivered it to the necessary people at the necessary time,  RIA quoted him as saying. Levashov provided no further details about his work for the party, RIA reported, though said he was an officer in the Russian army with access to classified information.  It was unclear if Levashov was a serving officer or an army reservist having completed mandatory military service.  He also told the court investigators in the United States would torture him for information about his political work if he was sent there to face the charges against him.  If I go to the U.S., I will die in a year. They want to get information of a military nature and about the United Russia party,  RIA quoted him as saying.  I will be tortured, within a year I will be killed, or I will kill myself.  Levashov has long been seen by cyber security investigators to be the person behind an online persona known as Peter Severa. Severa spent years listed among the world s 10 most prolific spammers, according to spam-tracking group Spamhaus. U.S. prosecutors have accused Levashov of running the infamous Kelihos botnet, a network of more than 100,000 infected devices used by cyber criminals to distribute viruses, ransomware, phishing emails and other spam attacks. Russia lodged its own request for Levashov s extradition last week, RIA reported. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Romanian computer hacker who revealed the existence of a private email server used by Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state pleaded guilty to hacking-related offenses on Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department said. Marcel Lazar, who used the alias “Guccifer,” entered his guilty plea before Judge James Cacheris in U.S. District Court, Alexandria, Virginia, the department said in a statement. Sentencing was set for Sept. 1. In recent media interviews, Lazar claimed he had easily hacked into Clinton’s controversial private email server. But the Justice Department statement did not confirm this claim, and a law enforcement official said investigators did not find evidence to support the claim. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senate leaders, struggling to keep a seven-year promise to end Obamacare, turned their focus on Wednesday to passing a slimmed-down “skinny” repeal measure that would throw the issue into negotiations with the House of Representatives. The last-ditch effort came after senators voted 55-45 against a straight repeal of Obamacare, which would have provided for a two-year delay in implementation to give Congress time to work out a replacement. Seven Republicans opposed the measure. It was the Senate’s second failure in 24 hours to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which expanded health insurance to about 20 million people, many of them low-income. On Tuesday, senators rejected the repeal-and-replace plan Republicans had worked on since May. The failures underscored the party’s deep divisions on the role of government in helping provide access to healthcare as the Senate conducted its second day of a freewheeling debate that could stretch through the week. Republicans said they were still working out what would be in a skinny repeal, which could simply eliminate mandates requiring individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance, and abolish a tax on medical device manufacturers. Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said the party was trying to “figure out what the traffic will bear, in terms of getting 50 of our members to vote for things that will repeal as much of Obamacare as possible.” Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate. Any Senate legislation would be enough to kick the issue to a special negotiating committee with the House, which passed its own version in May. If that panel can agree on a new bill, the full House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, would again have to approve the legislation - a process that could last months. “I think people would look at it not necessarily based on its content, but as a forcing mechanism to cause the two sides of the building to try to solve it together,” Republican Senator Bob Corker said. “That’s going to be the last chance.” Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters there was growing support for a slimmed-down approach that would kick the can to negotiators. “I think there is plenty of agreement,” he said. President Donald Trump has come down hard on his fellow Republicans for failing to act on Obamacare, something he promised repeatedly to repeal and replace in his election campaign last year. Some Senate Republicans were growing uncomfortable with the chaotic debate. “We’ve got to have a more organized process,” Republican Senator Ron Johnson said, noting the skinny repeal would simply delay acting on the core issue. “We just don’t have the courage and really the intestinal fortitude to suck it up and ... do this right.” Late on Wednesday, only 10 senators voted for a largely symbolic amendment stating lawmakers’ commitment to preserve a part of Obamacare that helped states expand the government’s Medicaid insurance program for the poor to cover a wider net of people.  Democrats refused to approve any amendment to a bill they dislike and the vote primarily highlighted deep divisions among Republicans. The amendment was introduced by Senator Dean Heller, who faces a tough re-election fight in Nevada next year, and supported by Senators Susan Collins, John McCain and other party moderates who have expressed skepticism about the repeal-and-replace process. Trump attacked one of those senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, by name in an early morning tweet on Wednesday. Murkowski, one of two party members who voted on Tuesday against opening debate on a bill to end Obamacare, told MSNBC she was not worried about the political fallout. “Every day shouldn’t be about winning elections. How about just doing a little bit of governing around here?” she said. Healthcare industry organizations are similarly troubled and have urged a more bipartisan effort. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents health insurers across the country, said that if the individual mandate is repealed, it must be replaced with incentives for people to buy health insurance and keep it year-round. The mandate is considered critical to helping hold down the cost of premiums, because it means that healthy people as well as the sick, who incur high medical costs, buy insurance. The group also said the government needed to fund subsidies for medical expenses and provide funds to cover high-cost patients. Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), a health insurer with more than 1 million customers in Obamacare individual insurance plans, threatened to further shrink its 2018 market participation because of uncertainty about the government paying for the subsidies that make the plans affordable for millions of Americans.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three Republican senators, hoping to speed the hiring of law enforcement agents on U.S. borders, on Friday introduced legislation waiving lie detector tests for job applicants who already serve in law enforcement or have done military service. The “Boots on the Border Act” was backed by Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, Senator John McCain, a member of that panel, and Senator Jeff Flake, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees immigration policy. Flake, in a statement, noted that long screening procedures have resulted in 1,768 Border Patrol positions and 1,046 Customs and Border Protection jobs remaining unfilled. At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security has plans to add more than 5,000 border enforcement agents to the current force. The legislation, which would have to go through several steps in the Senate and House of Representatives before it could become law, comes as the Trump administration is stepping up deportations of illegal immigrants. It also is moving to restrict travel in the United States for people from six predominately Muslim countries, a move that faces legal challenges. Under the Senate bill, CBP could waive current polygraph requirements for applicants who have been working in federal, state and local law enforcement for the past three years, have clean employment records and have successfully completed polygraph and other background investigations. The bill also would cover U.S. armed forces personnel and veterans. “This legislation would address CBP’s chronic staffing shortage by streamlining background tests for qualified veterans, military service members, and law enforcement officers in good standing,” McCain said in a statement.

"Many Americans have suspected that the rise of Donald Trump, who launched his campaign attacking Latinos and has gone on to demonize blacks, Muslims, women and even Catholics, is tied to bigoted beliefs among a segment of Republican voters.Despite the protests from some on the right and even the mainstream media claiming that Trump supporters are backing their man solely due to  economic insecurity,  some new polling data has begun to confirm that the movement behind Trump is simply a white supremacist movement.Mr. Trump s popularity with white, working-class voters who are more likely than other Republicans to believe that whites are a supreme race and who long for the Confederacy may make him unpopular among leaders in his party. But it s worth noting that he isn t persuading voters to hold these beliefs. The beliefs were there   and have been for some time.Mr. Trump has reinvigorated explicit appeals to ethnocentrism, and some voters are responding.Based on the results of those polls, here are nine of the amazingly racist things Trump supporters seriously believe:When Trump says  Make America Great Again,  it seems like many of his followers really mean  Make America White Again.

"PHILADELPHIA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday floated the idea of imposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico to pay for a wall at the southern U.S. border, sending the peso tumbling and deepening a crisis between the two neighbors. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto announced on Twitter around midday on Thursday that he was scrapping a planned trip to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that Mexico pay for a wall on the U.S. border. Later in the day, White House spokesman Sean Spicer sent the Mexican peso falling to its low for the day when he told reporters that Trump wanted a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for construction of the wall. Spicer gave few details, but his comments resembled an existing idea, known as a border adjustment tax, that the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives is considering as part of a broad tax overhaul.  The White House said later its proposal was in the early stages. Asked if Trump favored a border adjustment tax, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said such a tax would be “one way” of paying for the border wall. “It’s a buffet of options,” he said. The plan being weighed by House Republicans would exempt export revenues from taxation but impose a 20 percent tax on imported goods, a significant change from current U.S. policy. “If you tax exports from Mexico into the United States, you’re going to make things ranging from avocados to appliances to flat-screen tvs, you’re going to make them more expensive,” Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told reporters at the Mexican Embassy in Washington on Thursday night. Countries like Mexico would not pay such taxes directly. Companies would face the tax if they import products made there into the United States, potentially raising prices for American consumers. The idea is unpopular with retailers and businesses that sell imported goods in the United States. It also has met opposition from some lawmakers worried about the impact on U.S. consumers. Trump himself appeared to pan the idea in a Wall Street Journal interview last week, saying the House border adjustment provision was “too complicated.” Even after Trump’s comments, congressional Republicans have continued to discuss the issue with White House officials in an effort to bring them on board with the idea. Trump, who visited Republican lawmakers at their policy retreat in Philadelphia, told them he would use tax reform legislation to pay for the border wall. “We’re working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route,” he said. Trump, who took office last week, views the wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. Mexico has long insisted it will not heed Trump’s demands to pay for the construction project. He signed an executive order for construction of the wall on Wednesday. The move provoked outrage in Mexico. A planned meeting between Videgaray and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was canceled, a department spokeswoman said.  Videgaray said Mexico would work with Trump but that paying for the wall was out of the question. “There are things that go beyond negotiation,” he said. “This is about our dignity and our pride.” Pena Nieto, who had been under pressure to cancel the summit, tweeted on Thursday: “We have informed the White House that I will not attend the working meeting planned for next Tuesday with @POTUS.” Trump had tweeted earlier that it would be better for the Mexican leader not to come if Mexico would not pay for the wall. He said later the meeting was canceled by mutual agreement. Relations have been frayed since Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, characterizing Mexican immigrants as murderers and rapists. His trade rhetoric has hit the Mexican economy, causing consumers to rein in spending and foreign businesses to wait on new investments, according to the International Monetary Fund. Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada and slap high tariffs on American companies that have moved jobs south of the border. Mexico ships 80 percent of its exports to the United States, and about half of Mexico’s foreign direct investment has come from its northern neighbor over the past two decades. The United States runs a $58.8 billion trade deficit with Mexico, according to the latest U.S. government figures. But Mexico is also the United States’ second-largest export market. ",1
"(Reuters) - New Jersey taxpayers will owe $2.62 million for roughly a year’s worth of work by a team of professionals called in to help turn around the distressed gambling hub Atlantic City, according to invoices obtained and compiled by Reuters. It is not clear what taxpayers have to show for it. Despite the work by a state-appointed emergency manager and the law and accounting firms he hired, so little progress has been made in reversing the seaside resort’s fortunes that lawmakers are now considering a full takeover of city operations. Reuters reported in September that the amount was $2.15 million, but invoice reports since then for additional work by restructuring lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom have pushed the total up by 20 percent. Reuters obtained the documents through a public records request. Governor Chris Christie appointed Kevin Lavin as emergency manager on Jan. 22, 2015. Since then, Lavin’s team has produced one report, in March.  The Press of Atlantic City this month obtained a non-public  draft of a follow-up report. A spokesman for Lavin told Reuters last week that a report is expected “within the coming weeks.” Four of the city’s eight casinos closed in 2014, pummeled by  competition from neighboring states. That contributed to a 70 percent reduction in the city’s property tax base, to a projected $6 billion this year from $20.5 billion in 2010.  Lavin and his team - including Skadden, Ernst & Young LLP [ERNY.UL], and mediator Donald Steckroth - were to review and propose solutions to the city’s immediate fiscal crisis, suggest possible longer-term fixes and negotiate with labor unions. Separately, the state had already appointed a monitor and had to approve the city’s budget and hiring. But lawmakers are seeking an even firmer grasp. On Tuesday, they introduced legislation that would strip Atlantic City’s elected officials of most of their control, except for the ability to file for municipal bankruptcy. “You can’t justify a $262 million budget for 40,000 people. It’s obscene,” Senate President Steve Sweeney, a co-sponsor of the bill, said earlier this week. “(The mayor and city council) need to make the tough decisions now.” Mayor Don Guardian and city council members denounced the takeover proposal. Guardian said on Wednesday the city trimmed $14 million from its 2015 budget and expects to cut $16 million more this year. ",1
"The worst thing is the number of white people and people with ties to law enforcement officers will pay to see one of the most influential, openly anti-white, anti-cop entertainers in America There are reportedly several Pittsburgh police officers refusing to work security for Beyonc s May 31 concert at Heinz Field, due to what they call the singer s anti-police lyrics in her latest Black Lives Matter-themed album,  Lemonade.  But city officials may force those officers to provide security for the show. There are police officers that have expressed that they do not want to support an artist that they don t like what she has to say,  said Robert Swartzwelder, president of the Fraternal Order of the Police Lodge No. 1.  It s up to them what they want to do with their off-duty time. Concert venues, like Heinz Field, usually ask city officials to provide off-duty police officers to work security or direct traffic at an event. The choice to work these events is usually each police officer s to make.However, a memorandum to officers from the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police says the city may appoint between 29 to 35 officers to work at the concert if they don t recruit enough volunteers.Click HERE for Beyonc s racist, cop-hating video.Swartzwelder said the city s plan would be in direct breach of the contract agreement between the city of Pittsburgh and the police department. Such a move would force the Fraternal Order of the Police to file an unfair labor practice complaint on behalf of its member officers.Last February, the Miami Fraternal Order of Police announced a boycott of Beyonc s concert where her  Formation  world tour would be kicking off. Similar calls to boycott Beyonc  were lodged from Tampa, Florida to Texas.Earlier this month, members from several police organizations, including the Pasadena Police Department and the Coalition for Police and Sheriffs, held a protest near Beyonc s concert in Houston, Texas.Already aware of the criticisms of her music, Beyonc  upped the ante last month and decided to sell  Boycott Beyonc  merchandise, including T-shirts, cellphone cases, and hats.Via: Breitbart News ",0

"Residents in Aurora, Indiana are upset after seeing a parade float on Saturday which depicted Donald Trump flipping the switch on Hillary Clinton in an electric chair. As if that wasn t bad enough, the float also featured someone in blackface portraying President Obama as an Easter Island figure with an oversized head. The float is plastered with a Trump/Pence sign, a Make America Great Again sign and of course, something with Benghazi written on it and it also mentions Clinton s health.An Aurora mother posted a photo on Facebook of the offensive float. Who thinks this is appropriate for a fair parade where children, some of them minorities and girls, are marching and playing instruments and watching? Who thinks this is something to laugh at or be proud of?  Penny Britton wrote on her Facebook page.  This is disgusting. This makes me embarrassed to say I live here. This is Aurora, Indiana. Congratulations. That prompted different comments ranging from calling it  disgusting  and  racist,  to another saying  Who cares! On Saturday morning, the float was featured as part of the Aurora Farmers Fair Parade.WCPO reports:It s sponsored by the Aurora Lions Club, according to its website, and touted as Indiana s oldest street festival. The theme of the parade was  Celebrating the Past, Embracing the Future. A Lions Club board member spoke with WCPO and said the organization was not prepared to make a statement.The parade manager did not return a call by a WCPO reporter.Meanwhile, Frank Linkmeyer, whose trailer which held the float is now in his driveway, says he didn t mean to offend anyone and he s sorry. He did a really bad job of trying to not be offensive. We re pretty sure Trump supporters will say it s being politically correct to object because children have to witness a display of racism. One man said,  If anyone is offended by it, well don t look at it.  It s pretty hard to change the channel on a parade you re attending. The float was right there in everyone s faces.Images via screen capture. ",0
"Donald Trump has now become well known for his completely inappropriate tendency to disrespect those who should be honored. We ve seen it numerous times in Trump s efforts to congratulate and honor members of the military, and we witnessed it again earlier today.On Saturday, Trump visited Houston, Texas to assist a Hurricane Harvey relief effort. While he was there, Trump attacked the media several times   but the most notable one was the incident that happened at the expense of the Coast Guard.In speaking with military officials and first responders who were responsible for saving lives in Texas, Trump couldn t help himself from going after the free press. Trump congratulated the Coast Guard, right before uttering this disgusting attack while pointing directly at the cameras: I hear the Coast Guard saved almost 11,000 people by going into winds the media would not go into. They will not go into those winds unless it s a really good story, in which case they will. For someone who wants the media to be nicer to him and protect his fragile ego, Trump sure doesn t know how to behave himself. The hilarious thing about what Trump just said is that several members of the media did far more to help Harvey victims than Trump did. If he would turn off Fox News for a second and actually pay attention to real news, he would have known that several media figures were helping the Coast Guard and other first responders in their relief efforts. There have even been several documented instances in which reporters directly assisted Harvey victims WHILE they were working. But of course, we can t expect Trump to take the high road   ever.

"HUGE NEWS: The head coach of the University of Michigan s football team just tweeted that the football team WILL watch  American Sniper.  Coach Harbaugh made his remarks in defiance of the university and the Muslim Student Association   who canceled an upcoming screening of the film. Coach Harbaugh said he is  proud to be an American and if that offends anybody   then so be it. To hell with a true story about one of the most important American military heroes of our time. Sadly, PC trumps all in liberal colleges and universities across the United States University:  While our intent was to show a film, the impact of the content was harmful, and made students feel unsafe and unwelcome at our program A scheduled movie screening of  American Sniper  at the University of Michigan was abruptly cancelled Tuesday after nearly 300 students and others complained the film perpetuates  negative and misleading stereotypes  against Muslims. The movie American Sniper not only tolerates but promotes anti-Muslim   rhetoric and sympathizes with a mass killer,  according to an online letter circulated among the campus community via Google Docs that garnered the signatures.The signers were mostly students, but also some staff, as well as the Muslim Students  Association and the president of Students Allied for Freedom and Equality, a Palestinian solidarity group at UMich.The online memo, titled a  collective letter from Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) and Muslim students on campus,  accused the public university of  tolerating dangerous anti-Muslim and anti-MENA propaganda  by showing the movie, the highest grossing film of 2014.It follows U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who served four combat tours in Operation Iraqi Freedom and was awarded two Silver Stars, five Bronze Stars with Valor, two Navy and Marine Corp Achievement Medals, and one Navy and Marine Corps commendation, according to his official Facebook page. But the protestors see him differently. Chris Kyle was a racist who took a disturbing stance on murdering Iraqi civilians,  the collective letter stated.  Middle Eastern characters in the film are not lent an ounce of humanity and watching this movie is provocative and unsafe to MENA and Muslim students who are too often reminded of how little the media and world values their lives.   The University of Michigan should not participate in further perpetuating these negative and misleading stereotypes. The film was set to be shown Friday on campus, but the letter   which asked for its cancellation   was successful. While our intent was to show a film, the impact of the content was harmful, and made students feel unsafe and unwelcomed at our program,  stated The Center for Campus Involvement, which oversees student activities and is run by university employees, as it announced its decision Tuesday on its various social media accounts, including Twitter and Facebook. We deeply regret causing harm to members of our community, and appreciate the thoughtful feedback provided to us by students and staff alike. Image of collective letter; not all signatories shownUniversity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald confirmed to The College Fix on Tuesday the movie was cancelled. The Center for Campus Involvement   did hear concerns from students,  Fitzgerald said, noting he did not have further details at the time.The Center for Campus Involvement did not return multiple phone calls seeking comment, but its official Twitter account noted  Paddington Bear,  a PG-rated movie about a stuffed animal s misadventures, will be shown instead of  American Sniper. We have elected to pull the film from this week s program and screen another movie in its place that we believe better creates the fun, engaging atmosphere we seek, without excluding valued members of our community,  the center stated.But not all students agree with this decision. It would be nice to see the university   take a stand against outrageous claims of  student exclusion,  University of Michigan sophomore Jason Weaver told The College Fix.  The film American Sniper in no way creates student exclusion any more than Saving Private Ryan. Both show American soldiers at war, the atrocities of war, and the costs of war, yet I m sure Saving Private Ryan would not illicit the same response. Just because the enemy in American Sniper shares ethnicity with students on campus does not mean they are conflated as the enemy any more than a German student should be conflated with Nazism. American Sniper  was set to be shown as part of the center s  UMix Late Night  program, which brings movies, games, dances and other social events to the student body. The center is responsible for more than 300 co-curricular programs each year, including cultural and educational programs, films, art exhibits, UMix Late Night, athletic/spirit activities and various performance groups and concerts, its website states. We in the Center for Campus Involvement and the UMix Late Night program did not intend to exclude any students or communities on campus through showing this film,  the center s announcement stated.  UMix should always be a safe space for students to engage, unwind, and create community with others, and we commit to listening to and learning from our community in the interest of fostering that environment.   We will take time to deeper understand and screen for content that can negatively stereotype a group.   Via: College Fix",0
"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - An outspoken deputy of Cambodia s detained opposition leader fled the country on Tuesday, saying she feared for her safety after Prime Minister Hun Sen threatened further arrests of opposition politicians. Kem Sokha, leader of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was arrested on Sept. 3 and charged with treason in a widening crackdown on critics of Hun Sen, which his opponents say is a ploy to win an election next year.  Without a true opposition and with the wide level of fear, there s no hope for free and fair elections in 2018,  Mu Sochua, 63, told Reuters after leaving Cambodia, adding that she  did not feel safe .  Democracy in Cambodia is very rapidly eroding to a point where no other opposing forces are left to fight dictatorship,  she said. Government spokesman Phay Siphan said Mu Sochua had  left of her own choice  and he did not know whether authorities had planned to arrest her. Known internationally for campaigns to fight sex trafficking and assert women s rights, Mu Sochua had been among the most vocal opposition politicians in Cambodia since Kem Sokha was arrested and accused of plotting to take power with U.S. help. She told Reuters last week that around half the CNRP s members of parliament had fled the country in fear. Hun Sen, who has ruled for more than three decades, threatened more arrests of opposition politicians on Monday, attacking them as  rebels in the city  bent on staging a  colour revolution  despite past failures. Western countries have condemned the arrest of Kem Sokha and called for his release, saying the credibility of next year s election is in doubt, but they have given no sign of taking measures against the government. Meanwhile, China has voiced support for the government of Hun Sen, 65. He is a former commander in the Khmer Rouge who later defected from the group whose genocide devastated Cambodia in the 1970s. Strong gains by the CNRP at local council elections in June had pointed to a tough battle for Hun Sen in next year s general election. Despite years of annual economic growth of around 7 percent that have helped transform Cambodia from a failed state, popular anger has grown over inequality and accusations of cronyism. In his first comments since his arrest, Kem Sokha said in a Facebook posting on Monday that he was seeking positive change in Cambodia through the ballot box and not through revolution as charged. One of his three deputies remains in Cambodia. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha so far is a video from 2013 in which he tells supporters that he has support from unidentified Americans for a plan to gain power. ",1
"On Saturday, Paul Ryan posted a photo to his Instagram. The photo was a mass selfie of a large group of Capitol Hill interns. It wasn t long before social media commentators noticed something very wrong with the photo.In his post, Ryan wrote: I think this sets a record for the most number of #CapitolHill interns in a single selfie. #SpeakerSelfie. So here s the photo:Photo via InstagramThat s a huge sea of white people. Now, I am sure that the interns shown in the photo have worked very hard to get to where they are; however, it is very problematic to see that the people who aid lawmakers don t even come close to representing the United States. Screenshot from InstagramScreenshot from InstagramThis isn t just a matter of one photo inaccurately describing the racial makeup of Congressional aides. According to a report released in 2015 by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, minorities are severely underrepresented on the Capital Hill. One of the key findings of the report is that: Although people of color make up over 36 percent of the U.S. population and over 28 percent of the citizen voting-age population, they represent only 7.1 percent of top Senate staffers.  They report also says that,   Senate offices representing states with large Hispanic and AfricanAmerican populations hire few senior staffers of color. Commentators quickly made the connection between the lack of diversity in the photo and the GOP  autopsy report  that concluded that the Republican Party is going to go extinct if they do not reach out to minorities and try to get them to join their ranks.Republicans hate hiring mandates but they sure know how to make a case for them, as we can clearly see from the photo.Featured image from screenshot via Instagram",0
"Donald Trump and his favorite daughter, Ivanka, are still getting a lot of heat for the stunt they pulled at the G20 summit in Germany last week. The entire world was shocked when Trump stepped out of the G20 meeting and Ivanka took his seat and sat in for him at the leader s table   a move that earned Trump and his administration a massive amount of criticism and outrage.While most of the country was disgusted that Ivanka, who was not elected or qualified, was allowed to sit next to the attending world leaders, Trump and his daughter found refuge on Fox News  Outnumbered, who passionately defended their favorite dictator and his daughter. Ignoring the fact that this was highly inappropriate, Fox News  Jason Chaffetz and the rest of the Outnumbered panelists were more than happy to defend it. Chaffetz said: Ivanka Trump, she is part of the administration. She does have her father s ear. She can actually get things done. and they were talking about a topic in which she s personally engaged. I think it was wholly appropriate. If that wasn t ridiculous enough, the segment was made far worse by Harris Faulkner, who actually said that Ivanka was qualified to be at the G20 meeting because her products were  hot online.  Faulkner said: It must be so frustrating for Democrats not to have any low hanging fruit. They re grasping now. They re really grasping. She is there in a capacity of someone who has run a very successful corporation and her items are selling by the way, hot online. It really does not get any dumber than that   especially considering that Ivanka s brand has seen a major decline since her father s presidential campaign and failing presidency ruined the family s name and reputation. Fox News has been known to shamelessly promote Trump and his family, but this is just embarrassing.You can watch Fox News defend Trump and Ivanka below:Featured image via Sean Gallup / Getty Images",0

Among the recipients is the notorious open borders group League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Minority Access Inc., a Maryland-based nonprofit committed to decreasing disparities and reducing incidences of environmental injustices, and the renowned National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Others include the Society of American Indian Government Employees and the Asian American Government Executive Network. In all, the Pentagon s Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (ODME) gave these and other groups north of $300,000, according to a DOD Inspector General report released this month. These are considered  affinity  groups involved with networking or professional associations that are often race, ethnic background or gender based, according to the report.The high-ranking official who violated DOD and government rules by doling out the cash to unqualified  non-federal entities  (NFE) is Clarence Johnson, the DOD s Director of Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity. In 2010 Johnson, a veteran Pentagon official, was assigned to assist the Army in implementing a robust diversity strategy. The position came with a hefty budget to support diversity outreach functions and Johnson launched a cash giveaway, filling the coffers of groups that should not have received public funds. In its report the DOD watchdog concludes that Johnson  improperly co-sponsored NFEs that he had selected.  Auditors found that Johnson spent $301,000 on NFE sponsorships and recommend  corrective action.  The money flowed through a company called New Concepts Management Solutions (NCMS) that was evidently handpicked by Johnson. In 2012, the Office of Diversity Management hired a consulting firm called Deloitte for $480,554 to handle the diversity outreach allocations.Here s a brief breakdown of how some of the money was divided. The Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute Conference got $25,000, the Society of American Indian Government Employees got $12,000 for a training conference and a conglomerate called Latina Style Outreach received $20,000. LULAC and the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Corporation (HENAAC) received $25,000 each. It appears that Johnson knew well that he was violating agency rules when he headed the diversity crusade because the report reveals that the DOD Office of Special Counsel has consistently said that the agency should not  sponsor  non-federal entities like the ones Johnson gave money to. In addition to money, Johnson provided these various groups with logistical manpower compliments of Uncle Sam.It s unlikely that Johnson will face any repercussions for his transgressions or, at most, a weak slap on the hand. He certainly appears confident in testimony to investigators probing his violations.  My job is to grow, or focus on growing, the presence of minorities and women  in government jobs with higher pay scales, Johnson told investigators. He added that the mission of his office is diversity outreach, which involves informing the diverse audience. This is why he seeks affinity groups that have a  national reach  and influence.President Obama has made it his mission to culturally transform government by teaching federal workers about diversity, race and gender, healthcare disparities and cultural competencies. The effort has affected practically every major agency, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS), among others. It s been a costly initiative for taxpayers. A few months ago a Judicial Watch investigation found that the Obama administration has paid a Chicago-based firm millions of dollars to strengthen the federal workplace with its brand of diversity consulting. This includes two recent DHS contracts for $24,000 and $10,000 and one for $8,500 from the Department of Energy (DOE). Via: Judicial Watch",0
"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court on Tuesday set a March 15 deadline for North Carolina state lawmakers to redraw legislative districts found to be racially “gerrymandered,” and ordered a new round of elections by next November for the 28 seats at stake. In August, the same special three-judge panel ruled that nine state Senate districts and 19 state House districts, as carved out in a plan adopted by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2011, were unconstitutional. The panel had told North Carolina’s legislature to start revamping its political maps immediately, but left the existing boundaries intact for the Nov. 8 state elections, because of time constraints. “While special elections have costs, those costs pale in comparison to the injury caused by allowing citizens to continue to be represented by legislators elected pursuant to a racial gerrymander,” the panel wrote in its seven-page order on Tuesday. North Carolina has already appealed the August ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has yet to act. Republicans also vowed to appeal Tuesday’s ruling, handed down by two U.S. district judges and one circuit judge. The ruling is a “politically motivated” abuse of judicial authority, said state Senator Bob Rucho and Representative David Lewis, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate redistricting committees. If upheld, the court order “is a gross overreach that blatantly disregards the constitutional guarantee for voters to duly elect their legislators to biennial terms,” they said. Last year, the Southern Coalition for Social Justice challenged North Carolina’s latest political maps, saying  legislative district lines were drawn in 2011 so as to dilute the state’s black vote and give Republicans an advantage. The three-judge panel that heard the case agreed, and Tuesday’s order, essentially an extension of its August opinion, was hailed by the North Carolina Democratic Party. A separate three-judge U.S. court panel ruled in a similar case a week ago that state assembly districts in Wisconsin, as redrawn by its Republican-led legislature, were unconstitutionally gerrymandered. Tuesday’s North Carolina ruling sets a deadline of March 15 for newly elected legislators to approve a redistricting plan that passes constitutional muster. It also requires the state to hold special primary and general elections in the late summer and fall of 2017 to fill those 28 House and Senate seats. Moreover, state lawmakers elected to any of the disputed General Assembly seats in 2016 will serve for just one year, instead of the normal two, the court ruled, a limit set for those elected next fall as well.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators elected Chuck Schumer of New York as minority leader on Wednesday, and he tapped former presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders to help Democrats woo blue-collar workers, many of whom voted for President-elect Donald Trump. Senate Republicans also met and voted to keep Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the majority leader. Schumer, 65, replaces the retiring Harry Reid of Nevada as the top Democrat in the Senate as the party prepares to deal with Republican Trump and Republican majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Schumer said Democrats had learned from the Nov. 8 election that they needed “a sharper, bolder economic message about returning the economic system which so many feel is rigged against them to one that works for the people.” “We’re ready to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Republicans, working with soon-to-be-President Trump on issues where we agree, but we will go toe-to-toe against the president-elect whenever our values or the progress we’ve made is under assault,” Schumer, who has been in the Senate since 1999, told reporters after the Democrats’ closed-door election. In a move recognizing the influence of Sanders with many working-class voters, Schumer asked the independent senator from Vermont to be caucus head of outreach. Sanders, who lost the presidential primary to former senator and secretary of state Hillary Clinton, said his job was to reach out to “grassroots America.” Another liberal, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was given the role of vice chair of the conference while yet another progressive voice, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, was made conference secretary. Senator Joe Manchin, a more conservative Democrat from West Virginia, was named vice chairman of the Democratic policy and communications committee.  Schumer said he knew there would be differences of opinion on the new team, but that together the group could “speak to the blue-collar worker in West Virginia, and Michigan, as well as the people who live along the coast.”  Trump’s economic populism helped him flip some once-reliably Democratic areas in blue-collar states while Democrats did better in large urban centers and coastal states. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois remained minority whip, the No. 2 spot, while Senator Patty Murray of Washington was chosen as assistant Democratic leader. In the House, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi announced she was running for minority leader again and said she already has the support of more than two-thirds of her caucus. Pelosi, who may face a challenger, agreed this week to delay leadership elections until Nov. 30 after her fellow Democrats called for more time to reassess why they fell short of their goals in the Nov. 8 election.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - The people of West Papua are facing a  slow motion genocide  and demand independence from Indonesia, separatist leaders told Reuters after a march in Geneva, adding they would press their case with a petition to the United Nations in New York. Benny Wenda, international spokesman for the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP), said the human rights situation had worsened under Indonesian President Joko Widodo, with estimates of up to 8,000 people arrested last year.  They look at West Papua differently, as subhuman, and as a colony. We are not equal. That s why if we live with Indonesia, in 30 years time my people will disappear,  he told Reuters. Indonesian presidential spokesman Johan Budi declined to comment on the separatists  comments. West Papua and Papua provinces - often collectively referred to as West Papua - make up the western half of an island north of Australia, with independent Papua New Guinea to the east. The provinces have been gripped by a long-running and often violent separatist conflict since they were incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. Dutch colonial rule ended in 1963. Widodo has made easing the tension in the two provinces on the island a key goal, through stepping up investment, freeing political prisoners, and addressing human rights concerns.         However, Oridek Ap, coordinator for Free West Papua Campaign in the Netherlands, said his father was killed in 1984 for singing freedom songs, and it was still dangerous to speak out.  Sometimes they find a body and we have confirmation of death. But as long as somebody is disappeared we don t have confirmation,  he said.  When we talk about slow motion genocide, how can you prove it. On the other side of the border we are talking about 7-8 million Papuans. Why not on our side? This killing is still going on.  The separatists say there are 2.5 million West Papuans, roughly the same as 50 years ago.  What happened in 1969 was a fraud,  Wenda said.  This is why West Papuans believe that our right to self-determination under international law still exists.   Geneva is the house of human rights and freedom. That s why we start here, and then we go to New York,  he said. Wenda, who has political asylum in Britain, added:  We need to solve this problem in the United Nations.  Last month Indonesia struck a deal with U.S. mining firm Freeport McMoRan Inc to take a 51 percent stake in Grasberg, the world s second-biggest copper mine, which is in Papua. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Obama administration officials told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday they would oppose new sanctions on Iran if they interfere with last year’s international nuclear agreement, laying the groundwork for a potential fight over any legislation. “If legislation were to undermine the deal, by taking off the table commitments that we had put on the table, that would be a problem,” Adam Szubin, the acting Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told a House of Representatives hearing. “Certainly our allies around the world would see us taking back major chunks of the sanctions relief as bad faith,” Szubin told a Senate Banking Committee hearing later on Wednesday. House and Senate members are drafting new sanctions measures, accusing Iran of supporting terrorism, human rights abuses and violating its international commitments by testing ballistic missiles. They want to renew the Iran Sanctions Act, a broad U.S. law imposing sanctions over Iran’s nuclear and missile programs that expires at the end of 2016. Administration officials have urged Congress not to rush to renew the ISA. Lawmakers argue that new sanctions will help send a message that Washington will take a hard line, despite the nuclear pact. Every Republican in Congress and several of President Barack Obama’s fellow Democrats opposed the agreement. “I feel it’s not so terrible to have Congress come up with new sanctions if we feel Iran is violating its agreements,” said Representative Eliot Engel, top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who opposed the nuclear pact. Szubin and Stephen Mull, the State Department’s lead coordinator for implementing the nuclear deal, told lawmakers that, so far, the deal announced in July 2015 was being fully implemented. They said the administration was tightly tracking Iran’s compliance. “We believe that we and our allies in the region are considerably safer,” Mull said.  Members of Congress recently accused the administration of allowing sanctions workarounds that might provide Iran direct or indirect access to the U.S. financial system. Szubin reiterated the administration’s assurances that it had no such plans. Despite the easing of nuclear sanctions under the international agreement, Tehran’s hopes of rapidly ending its economic isolation have been complicated by companies’ concerns that doing business with Iran might violate non-nuclear sanctions that remain in place.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Florida’s rapidly growing Puerto Rican population heavily favors Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race, according to a poll released on Wednesday by groups with links to the Democrats.  Seventy-four percent of Puerto Ricans now registered to vote in Florida said they would likely pick Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, versus 17 percent for Trump, according to the poll from the Center for American Progress Action Fund and Latino Decisions. Puerto Ricans, who traditionally lean toward voting Democratic in Florida, are a big enough group to swing the closely-fought state. Florida, the third-largest state in the country in terms of electoral college votes needed to win the White House, has seen an influx of people from Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, as the Caribbean island’s economy has floundered in recent years.  More than one million Puerto Ricans now live in Florida, according to the Pew Research Center, making up about 5 percent of the total population. The Center for American Progress Action Fund is a progressive non-partisan organization that has been critical of Trump in the past. Latino Decisions has consulted for the Clinton campaign.        Florida is currently too close to call between Clinton and Trump, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, and both candidates have been focusing their campaigns there heading into the election. Trump angered many Hispanics when he launched his campaign last year by calling some Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers, and his hardline immigration policies have done little to attract Latino voters. The poll did not gauge the level of eligible Puerto Rican voters who have registered in Florida, an important measure given historically low Latino turnout. Latino voter registration lagged white and African-American voters in the 2014 congressional elections by 12 to 15 percentage points nationally, according to the U.S. Census. But it said Puerto Rican voters now registered in Florida appeared motivated. Some 84 percent said they would definitely vote, with another 14 percent saying they would probably do so. Only 2 percent said they definitely would not. The poll included 504 registered Puerto Rican voters in Florida with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 17 to Sept. 26. ",1
"Last night, at a rally in Melbourne, Florida, Trump was trying to build more fear of brown people in his base of loyalists by referencing a completely imaginary terror attack in Sweden. Since then, he s received an earful from the former Prime Minister of Sweden, prompted questions from confused Swedes, and social media has been abuzz with mockery of the imaginary attack, too.One would have expected Trump to respond fairly quickly, since he s now formally joined the ranks of Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer when it comes to fake terror attacks, but he didn t. He waited until this afternoon to respond, and it s extremely laughable:My statement as to what s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.

"America s next president could be eased into office not just by TV ads or speeches, but by Google s secret decisions, and no one except for me and perhaps a few other obscure researchers would know how this was accomplished.Research I have been directing in recent years suggests that Google, Inc., has amassed far more power to control elections indeed, to control a wide variety of opinions and beliefs than any company in history has ever had. Google s search algorithm can easily shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more up to 80 percent in some demographic groups with virtually no one knowing they are being manipulated, according to experiments I conducted recently with Ronald E. Robertson.Given that many elections are won by small margins, this gives Google the power, right now, to flip upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide. In the United States, half of our presidential elections have been won by margins under 7.6 percent, and the 2012 election was won by a margin of only 3.9 percent well within Google s control.There are at least three very real scenarios whereby Google perhaps even without its leaders  knowledge could shape or even decide the election next year. Whether or not Google executives see it this way, the employees who constantly adjust the search giant s algorithms are manipulating people every minute of every day. The adjustments they make increasingly influence our thinking including, it turns out, our voting preferences.What we call in our research the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME) turns out to be one of the largest behavioral effects ever discovered. Our comprehensive new study, just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), includes the results of five experiments we conducted with more than 4,500 participants in two countries. Because SEME is virtually invisible as a form of social influence, because the effect is so large and because there are currently no specific regulations anywhere in the world that would prevent Google from using and abusing this technique, we believe SEME is a serious threat to the democratic system of government.According to Google Trends, at this writing Donald Trump is currently trouncing all other candidates in search activity in 47 of 50 states. Could this activity push him higher in search rankings, and could higher rankings in turn bring him more support? Most definitely depending, that is, on how Google employees choose to adjust numeric weightings in the search algorithm. Google acknowledges adjusting the algorithm 600 times a year, but the process is secret, so what effect Mr. Trump s success will have on how he shows up in Google searches is presumably out of his hands.***Our new research leaves little doubt about whether Google has the ability to control voters. In laboratory and online experiments conducted in the United States, we were able to boost the proportion of people who favored any candidate by between 37 and 63 percent after just one search session. The impact of viewing biased rankings repeatedly over a period of weeks or months would undoubtedly be larger.In our basic experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups in which search rankings favored either Candidate A, Candidate B or neither candidate. Participants were given brief descriptions of each candidate and then asked how much they liked and trusted each candidate and whom they would vote for. Then they were allowed up to 15 minutes to conduct online research on the candidates using a Google-like search engine we created called Kadoodle.Each group had access to the same 30 search results all real search results linking to real web pages from a past election. Only the ordering of the results differed in the three groups. People could click freely on any result or shift between any of five different results pages, just as one can on Google s search engine.When our participants were done searching, we asked them those questions again, and, voil : On all measures, opinions shifted in the direction of the candidate who was favored in the rankings. Trust, liking and voting preferences all shifted predictably.More alarmingly, we also demonstrated this shift with real voters during an actual electoral campaign in an experiment conducted with more than 2,000 eligible, undecided voters throughout India during the 2014 Lok Sabha election there the largest democratic election in history, with more than 800 million eligible voters and 480 million votes ultimately cast. Even here, with real voters who were highly familiar with the candidates and who were being bombarded with campaign rhetoric every day, we showed that search rankings could boost the proportion of people favoring any candidate by more than 20 percent more than 60 percent in some demographic groups.Given how powerful this effect is, it s possible that Google decided the winner of the Indian election. Google s own daily data on election-related search activity (subsequently removed from the Internet, but not before my colleagues and I downloaded the pages) showed that Narendra Modi, the ultimate winner, outscored his rivals in search activity by more than 25 percent for sixty-one consecutive days before the final votes were cast. That high volume of search activity could easily have been generated by higher search rankings for Modi.Google s official comment on SEME research is always the same:  Providing relevant answers has been the cornerstone of Google s approach to search from the very beginning. It would undermine the people s trust in our results and company if we were to change course. Could any comment be more meaningless? How does providing  relevant answers  to election-related questions rule out the possibility of favoring one candidate over another in search rankings? Google s statement seems far short of a blanket denial that it ever puts its finger on the scales.There are three credible scenarios under which Google could easily be flipping elections worldwide as you read this:First, there is the Western Union ScenarioGoogle s executives decide which candidate is best for us and for the company, of course and they fiddle with search rankings accordingly. There is precedent in the United States for this kind of backroom king-making. Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States, was put into office in part because of strong support by Western Union. In the late 1800s, Western Union had a monopoly on communications in America, and just before the election of 1876, the company did its best to assure that only positive news stories about Hayes appeared in newspapers nationwide. It also shared all the telegrams sent by his opponent s campaign staff with Hayes s staff. Perhaps the most effective way to wield political influence in today s high-tech world is to donate money to a candidate and then to use technology to make sure he or she wins. The technology guarantees the win, and the donation guarantees allegiance, which Google has certainly tapped in recent years with the Obama administration.Given Google s strong ties to Democrats, there is reason to suspect that if Google or its employees intervene to favor their candidates, it will be to adjust the search algorithm to favor Hillary Clinton. In 2012, Google and its top executives donated more than $800,000 to Obama but only $37,000 to Romney. At least six top tech officials in the Obama administration, including Megan Smith, the country s chief technology officer, are former Google employees. According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, since Obama took office, Google representatives have visited the White House ten times as frequently as representatives from comparable companies once a week, on average.Hillary Clinton clearly has Google s support and is well aware of Google s value in elections. In April of this year, she hired a top Google executive, Stephanie Hannon, to serve as her chief technology officer. I don t have any reason to suspect Hannon would use her old connections to aid her candidate, but the fact that she or any other individual with sufficient clout at Google has the power to decide elections threatens to undermine the legitimacy of our electoral system, particularly in close elections.This is, in any case, the most implausible scenario. What company would risk the public outrage and corporate punishment that would follow from being caught manipulating an election? Second, there is the Marius Milner ScenarioA rogue employee at Google who has sufficient password authority or hacking skills makes a few tweaks in the rankings (perhaps after receiving a text message from some old friend who now works on a campaign), and the deed is done. In 2010, when Google got caught sweeping up personal information from unprotected Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries using its Street View vehicles, the entire operation was blamed on one Google employee: software engineer Marius Milner. So they fired him, right? Nope. He s still there, and on LinkedIn he currently identifies his profession as  hacker.  If, somehow, you have gotten the impression that at least a few of Google s 37,000 employees are every bit as smart as Milner and possess a certain mischievousness well, you are probably right, which is why the rogue employee scenario isn t as far-fetched as it might seem. And third and this is the scariest possibility there is the Algorithm ScenarioUnder this scenario, all of Google s employees are innocent little lambs, but the software is evil. Google s search algorithm is pushing one candidate to the top of rankings because of what the company coyly dismisses as  organic  search activity by users; it s harmless, you see, because it s all natural. Under this scenario, a computer program is picking our elected officials.To put this another way, our research suggests that no matter how innocent or disinterested Google s employees may be, Google s search algorithm, propelled by user activity, has been determining the outcomes of close elections worldwide for years, with increasing impact every year because of increasing Internet penetration. SEME is powerful precisely because Google is so good at what it does; its search results are generally superb. Having learned that fact over time, we have come to trust those results to a high degree. We have also learned that higher rankings mean better material, which is why 50 percent of our clicks go to the first two items, with more than 90 percent of all clicks going to that precious first search page. Unfortunately, when it comes to elections, that extreme trust we have developed makes us vulnerable to manipulation.In the final days of a campaign, fortunes are spent on media blitzes directed at a handful of counties where swing voters will determine the winners in the all-important swing states. What a waste of resources! The right person at Google could influence those key voters more than any stump speech could; there is no cheaper, more efficient or subtler way to turn swing voters than SEME. SEME also has one eerie advantage over billboards: when people are unaware of a source of influence, they believe they weren t being influenced at all; they believe they made up their own minds.Republicans, take note: A manipulation on Hillary Clinton s behalf would be particularly easy for Google to carry out, because of all the demographic groups we have looked at so far, no group has been more vulnerable to SEME in other words, so blindly trusting of search rankings than moderate Republicans. In a national experiment we conducted in the United States, we were able to shift a whopping 80 percent of moderate Republicans in any direction we chose just by varying search rankings.There are many ways to influence voters more ways than ever these days, thanks to cable television, mobile devices and the Internet. Why be so afraid of Google s search engine? If rankings are so influential, won t all the candidates be using the latest SEO techniques to make sure they rank high?SEO is competitive, as are billboards and TV commercials. No problem there. The problem is that for all practical purposes, there is just one search engine. More than 75 percent of online search in the United States is conducted on Google, and in most other countries that proportion is 90 percent. That means that if Google s CEO, a rogue employee or even just the search algorithm itself favors one candidate, there is no way to counteract that influence. It would be as if Fox News were the only television channel in the country. As Internet penetration grows and more people get their information about candidates online, SEME will become an increasingly powerful form of influence, which means that the programmers and executives who control search engines will also become more powerful.Worse still, our research shows that even when people do notice they are seeing biased search rankings, their voting preferences still shift in the desired directions even more than the preferences of people who are oblivious to the bias. In our national study in the United States, 36 percent of people who were unaware of the rankings bias shifted toward the candidate we chose for them, but 45 percent of those who were aware of the bias also shifted. It s as if the bias was serving as a form of social proof; the search engine clearly prefers one candidate, so that candidate must be the best. (Search results are supposed to be biased, after all; they re supposed to show us what s best, second best, and so on.)Biased rankings are hard for individuals to detect, but what about regulators or election watchdogs? Unfortunately, SEME is easy to hide. The best way to wield this type of influence is to do what Google is becoming better at doing every day: send out customized search results. If search results favoring one candidate were sent only to vulnerable individuals, regulators and watchdogs would be especially hard pressed to find them.For the record, by the way, our experiments meet the gold standards of research in the behavioral sciences: They are randomized (which means people are randomly assigned to different groups), controlled (which means they include groups in which interventions are either present or absent), counterbalanced (which means critical details, such as names, are presented to half the participants in one order and to half in the opposite order) and double-blind (which means that neither the subjects nor anyone who interacts with them has any idea what the hypotheses are or what groups people are assigned to). Our subject pools are diverse, matched as closely as possible to characteristics of a country s electorate. Finally, our recent report in PNAS included four replications; in other words, we showed repeatedly under different conditions and with different groups that SEME is real.Our newest research on SEME, conducted with nearly 4,000 people just before the national elections in the UK this past spring, is looking at ways we might be able to protect people from the manipulation. We found the monster; now we re trying to figure out how to kill it. What we have learned so far is that the only way to protect people from biased search rankings is to break the trust Google has worked so hard to build.

"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis issued a stinging new critique of the Vatican s top administration on Thursday, saying  traitors  stood in the way of his reforms and made any change as hard as cleaning Egypt s  Sphinx  with a toothbrush . For the fourth year running, Francis used his annual Christmas greetings to the Roman Catholic Church s central bureaucracy, or Curia, to lecture the assembled cardinals, bishops and other department heads on the need for change.  Reforming Rome is like cleaning the Sphinx of Egypt with a toothbrush,  he said, quoting a 19th-century Belgian churchman. The phrase did not evoke much laughter when the pope read it in the frescoed Clementina Hall of the Vatican s Apostolic Palace. Since his election as the first Latin American pope in 2013, Francis has been trying to reform the Italian-dominated Curia to bring the Church s hierarchy closer to its members, to enact financial reforms and guide it out of scandals that marked the pontificate of his predecessor, former Pope Benedict. But he has encountered resistance, particularly as some departments have been closed, merged or streamlined.        Francis said some in the bureaucracy - the nerve center of the 1.2-billion-member Church and whose members are entrusted with carrying out the pope s decisions - were part of  cliques and plots . Francis called this  unbalanced and degenerate  and a  cancer that leads to a self-referential attitude . In his address on Thursday, he spoke of those  traitors of trust  who had been entrusted with carrying out reforms but  let themselves be corrupted by ambition and vainglory.  When they are quietly let go, he said,  they erroneously declare themselves to be martyrs of the system ... instead of reciting a  mea culpa  (Latin for  my fault ). Francis did not cite any specific examples. Last June the Vatican s first auditor general resigned suddenly. He later said he was forced to step down because he had discovered irregularities but the Vatican said he had been spying on his superiors. Earlier this month, the Vatican bank s deputy director was fired under circumstances that have not been explained. In July, in a major shake-up of the Vatican administration, Francis replaced Catholicism s top theologian, a conservative German cardinal who has been at odds with the pontiff s vision of a more inclusive Church. Francis said the overwhelming majority of Curia members were faithful, competent and some saintly. Later, in a separate meeting with lay Vatican employees and their families, Francis asked forgiveness for the failings of some Church officials.  He spoke hours before the funeral of Cardinal Bernard Law, the ex-Archbishop of Boston who resigned in disgrace after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests and whose name became a byword for scandal in the Catholic Church.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When lawyers for Donald Trump asked a court to throw out one of the proposed class actions over Trump University, they backed it up with a financial disclosure meant to bolster the Republican presidential candidate’s credentials as a global businessman. But the form they filed with the court was actually that of the man Trump hopes to succeed in the White House, Democratic President Barack Obama. The president’s nine-page disclosure filed before his 2012 re-election was erroneously included as an exhibit to a motion Trump filed in April asking U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel for the Southern District of California to toss the case before trial, according to a person familiar with the case. A corrected exhibit was filed on Tuesday.  Plaintiffs’ lawyer Jason Forge seized on the goof in a court document filed late on Friday opposing Trump’s motion. Forge said the candidate’s filing was meant for a court in “Bizarro world.”  “This is just one example of Trump’s statement’s complete lack of credibility,” Forge said. Julie Fei, a spokeswoman for O’Melveny & Myers, the firm that has been representing Trump in the case, declined to comment. In court filings, Trump’s lawyers said the form supported the “undisputed fact” that Trump is chairman, president and chief executive of the Trump Organization, which conducts business around the world and is affiliated with over 500 companies. Instead, it showed Obama’s royalties from his memoir “Dreams from My Father” and disclosed the first family’s 2011 assets of between $2.6 million and $8.3 million. Trump is facing two lawsuits in California and one in New York over Trump University that allege the series of real estate seminars taught students nothing and defrauded them of as much as $35,000 each in fees. The presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election has raised the litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated, and accusing the Indiana-born Curiel of being biased against him because of his Mexican ancestry.  Trump’s lawyers intended to file the 92-page financial disclosure form he made public last summer at the time he announced he was running for president. That lists some $1.4 billion in assets, including real estate and other holdings, and $265 million in liabilities. The disclosure does not note his net worth, which he has said is over $10 billion.

"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Parliament urged EU leaders on Wednesday to allow the next phase of Brexit negotiations to start, backing a motion that recognised the talks had advanced sufficiently as a well a line criticising Britain s lead negotiator David Davis. European Union leaders are almost certain to judge on Friday that  sufficient progress  has been made on the rights of citizens, the Brexit divorce bill and the Irish border to allow negotiations to move to the next phase. The EU executive recommended last week that leaders approve the start of trade talks. The European Parliament will have to approve any Brexit deal, although its motion on Wednesday, backed by 556 votes for to 62 against, was not binding.  The EU s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told lawmakers the next phase of talks would focus on a  short and defined  transition period and initial discussions on a future relationship. Future talks, he said, would be no less difficult.  They are tough, very tough because the issues are extremely complicated and because the consequences of Brexit are very serious,  he said, adding that British Prime Minister Theresa May was  courageous  and deserved respect. Nigel Farage of the anti-EU UKIP party called her  Theresa the appeaser  and said she had yielded on virtually everything. Barnier stressed that Britain could not renege on commitments made to ensure the talks moved on.  The agreement presented in a joint report last Friday was, in the view of some in Brussels, undermined by Davis s comment that it was more  a statement of intent  than legally binding. Davis has subsequently said he wants the accord swiftly translated into a legal text.   We will not accept any going back on this joint report. This progress has been agreed and will be rapidly translated into a withdrawal accord that is legally binding in all three areas and on some others that remain to be negotiated,  Barnier said. A lot more steps were required to secure an orderly withdrawal, he added.  We are not at the end of the road, neither regarding citizens  rights nor for the other subjects of the orderly withdrawal. We remain vigilant,  Barnier told the parliament. ",1

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Green groups on Friday slammed U.S. President Donald Trump for choosing a nominee for White House environmental panel who wrote in an opinion article last year that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. The White House said on Thursday that Trump had nominated Kathleen Hartnett White, who served as Texas’s top environmental regulator under the state’s former governor, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, to the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The council sets the administration’s environmental policy goals.  White, now a senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Institute, has questioned the notion that burning fossil fuels is causing harmful increases in global temperatures. In an opinion article  in the Austin American-Statesman newspaper on June 20, 2016, she said natural gas had been “falsely maligned” and should be known as the “gas of life.”  Environmental Working Group President Ken Cook said on Friday that assertion indicated that White would facilitate “the rampant looting of environmental and public health protection policies,” according to a news release. The Environmental Working Group describes itself as “a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.” The Sierra Club environmental group called White “a fossil fuel industry apologist” in a news release on Friday.  White did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  “Kathleen Hartnett White is eminently qualified having served as an environmental regulator and on numerous environmental boards and commissions,” a White House spokeswoman said. “Her nomination was cleared by the Office of Government Ethics. We look forward to Mrs. White being confirmed.”  An overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. White is not the first person Trump has picked to join his administration who rejects that scientific consensus. In March, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said he did not believe carbon dioxide was a major contributor to global warming.   ",1
"So once again, here we are. A new President must deal with the old war. President Donald Trump must decide on whether to send thousands of additional American troops overseas into the longest-running US combat theatre on the planet, Afghanistan.Back in March of 2016, 21WIRE s Shawn Helton penned a insightful piece entitled, HAWKISH DOVE: The Enigma of Donald Trump in Volatile Race to the White House. In this article, Helton describes how then GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump was putting forward a populist, alomist Paulist image among a bevy of warhawk and Neocon rivals.Back then, Helton described the media and political pressure placed on Trump: Recently, Trump was pressed again on matters concerning the Middle East and his response has been surprisingly diplomatic with a non-interventionist platform. Trump s open condemnation of the Bush administration for the Iraq war and the Obama White House for the destruction of Libya, has resonated across the board for voters on both sides of the political spectrum. Trump has asserted that 2003 s invasion in Iraq and the blitzkrieg in Libya via NATO members in 2011, is further evidence of failed US foreign policy throughout the world.Doubling down, the GOP frontrunner Trump, has also refused to pick a side between Israel and Palestine   and in true form to his business pedigree, stating that he would rather attempt to broker a peace deal in the ages old conflict, rather than tow the party line. Onlookers wondered how this stance would play if Trump ever made into office. Back then it was immpossible to know, but now after 6 months in office, we have something to work with. We saw how fast Trump reacted to the alleged  chemical weapons  attack at Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib, Syria on April 4, 2017. His errant, knee-jerk cruise missile strike days later might go down in history as one of the biggest fumbles in US history (if that s even possible to measure).Is Trump continuing down Obama s proven path of juggling multiple conflicts while engaging in illegal proxy wars?Vanity Fair explains a possible fait accompli:On the campaign trail, Donald Trump pitched Americans on an immiscible foreign-policy agenda, combining elements of staunch isolationism and a rejection of Bush-era interventionism with promises to  bomb the shit out of ISIS.  But in his four months as president, Trump, characteristically, has done something of a 180-degree turn. He turned over much of his military policy and decision-making to the same  embarrassing  generals he previously claimed to know more than; he authorized a missile strike and boots on the ground in Syria, a country he had repeatedly warned against getting involved with; and he increased troop levels in Iraq, doubling down on a tactic he had called  a horrible mistake. Now, the Trump administration is considering sending more troops into the war in Afghanistan, which he previously called  a complete waste.  On Tuesday, the president gave Defense Secretary James Mattis the authority to determine the number of troops in Afghanistan, The New York Times reports, a rejection of the management levels adopted by the Obama administration.Then there s the issue of rogue dinosaur John McCain, who refuses to retire and seems happy as ever to take down various and sundry nation-states, in order to quench his own desire for chaos and conflict:This dynamic has left some lawmakers frustrated. During a meeting last week in which Mattis conceded to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the U.S. is  not winning in Afghanistan right now,  John McCain derided the delay of a broader strategy.  We are now six months into this administration; we still haven t got a strategy for Afghanistan,  the Arizona senator said.  It makes it hard for us to support you when we don t have a strategy. We know what the strategy was for the last eight years don t lose. That hasn t worked. Mattis responded,  We are putting it together now, and there are actions being taken to make certain that we don t pay a price for the delay,  he said.  We recognize the need for urgency, and your criticism is fair, sir. It may be too early to tell, but getting the White House to decouple from Pentagon group-think may prove to be too hard a task for a President who is desperate for poll rating and a win, any win.Time will tell.***READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire SYRIA FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected a bid by Michigan to reinstate its Republican-backed ban on straight-ticket voting for the Nov. 8 general election.   The justices left in place a decision by a federal district judge in Michigan who in July suspended a law that abolished straight-ticket voting, the practice of using one mark to vote for all candidates from one party, finding that it would disproportionately affect black voters.  The 6th U.S. Court of Appeals upheld that finding last month, prompting the state to seek a stay from the Supreme Court. Two conservative justices on the eight-member court, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, voted to grant the request, the brief order said.    The Michigan law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by a Republican governor, was one of numerous voting measures passed at the state level that put new restrictions on voting. These measures also include stricter voter-identification laws and reduction of early-voting periods before election day. Proponents of the law, enacted in January, have said most states have moved away from a straight-ticket voting option. Removing the option forces voters to study candidates and encourages voters to make decisions based on criteria other than party affiliation, they said. Opponents say voting restrictions are aimed at reducing turnout of minorities, who are more likely to vote for Democrats. U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain in July granted a preliminary injunction sought by civil rights and labor groups who sued Michigan’s Secretary of State Ruth Johnson and Attorney General Bill Schuette. The judge said elimination of straight-ticket voting would be a burden on voting rights and cause long wait times at polls. After Friday’s decision, Schuette said, “It is my duty to defend Michigan’s laws, in this case a law that stands in 40 other states. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken and I will respect that decision.” The case is one of several voting disputes being litigated ahead of the election and is the second emergency application the Supreme Court has recently been asked to handle. On Aug. 31, the court rejected a bid by North Carolina to reinstate for November’s elections several voting restrictions, including a requirement that people show identification at the polls. The high court is short one justice following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February. As a result the court is evenly split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives. ",1
"BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are scrambling to cobble together a package of measures they hope will keep the Iran nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump ignores their pleas and decertifies the landmark 2015 agreement this week. The package would include a strong statement backing the deal by European powers, together with efforts to lobby the U.S. Congress and put wider pressure on Iran, officials said. But without strong U.S. support for the deal, senior officials in Berlin, Paris and London say it may be only a matter of time before the pact between Tehran and six world powers unravels, with grave consequences for Middle East security, nonproliferation efforts and transatlantic ties. The two-year-old agreement, under which Iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief, is viewed in Europe as a rare triumph of international diplomacy in the Middle East. As tensions over North Korea s nuclear activities risk boiling over into all-out war, any move by the United States to undermine the Iran deal is seen in Europe as utter folly. European capitals have been delivering this message to the White House and Congress in one of the most intense lobbying campaigns in recent memory. In the past weeks, European ambassadors have met dozens of U.S. lawmakers. And on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May lobbied Trump by phone. Despite this, Trump is expected declare this week that Iran is not complying with the pact. He is also due to unveil a tough new strategy toward Iran - including designating its Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization - that could sink the deal.  If the feeling is the United States no longer supports the agreement then the political reality is that the deal will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,  a senior French diplomat told Reuters. A decision by Trump to decertify would not automatically kill the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The expectation is that Trump would kick the ball to Congress, which would then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted as part of the JCPOA. THREE-PRONGED RESPONSE European officials said they were preparing a three-pronged strategy if this does occur. First, Berlin, London and Paris would issue statements reaffirming their commitment to the deal. Second, they would redouble efforts to lobby Congress, which appears keen to keep the deal, against any rash moves. And third, they would present measures to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile program and destabilizing policies in the Middle East   areas that fall outside the narrowly-focused nuclear deal. French President Emmanuel Macron alluded to this at the United Nations last month. Diplomats said the package was still in the works and they had not yet briefed Brussels on it. With the third step, the Europeans hope to build a bridge to Washington while keeping the JCPOA intact. But a German diplomat said ratcheting up pressure on Tehran was like walking a tightrope: push too hard and the whole deal could fall apart.  We all knew the JCPOA wasn t perfect, but by calling its benefits into question I see us only losing,  said a senior European diplomat who has been involved in negotiations with Iran since 2003, well before Washington joined the talks under President Barack Obama.  If Trump follows through on his threats it will be the second time in four months that he has distanced the United States from a major multilateral agreement despite intense lobbying by partners and members of his own cabinet. But in Europe, the Iran move would be seen as far more damaging than Trump s decision in June to pull out of the Paris climate accord.  The threat from Iran in terms of nuclear proliferation is more immediate. This is far more dangerous,  said Elmar Brok, a veteran foreign policy expert in the European Parliament and party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. European officials and analysts fear a breakdown of the JCPOA could lead to an arms race in the Middle East, a military conflict between Iran and Israel and an escalation of regional proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia. They fear it would also doom any chances, no matter how slim, for a negotiated deal with North Korea.  At the end of the day it s all about the risk of war,  said Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. There is also the danger of a further deterioration in transatlantic ties, especially if Washington targets European firms that do business in Iran. Were that to happen, the EU ambassador to Washington, David O Sullivan, has said Brussels would revert to a 1990s-era law that shields European companies from extraterritorial sanctions. Even if the EU were to take such a step, the senior French diplomat said European companies could think twice about their Iran commitments. Among firms that have announced big deals in Iran since the JCPOA went into force are planemaker Airbus, French energy group Total and Germany s Siemens.  One of the big difficulties of the agreement is ensuring the economic operators have confidence in the system and key to that is confidence in the United States,  the diplomat said. Any signs that European companies are pulling back could prompt the Iranians to reassess the merits of the nuclear deal.  The agreement with Iran is like a delicate plant,  said Omid Nouripour, an Iranian-born lawmaker with the German Greens party, which is expected to be part of Merkel s next coalition government.  It is a sign of what diplomacy can achieve but it is fragile. The American president doesn t appear to believe in diplomacy. He seems intent on crushing this plant.  ",1

"An employee of Safeside Tactical in Roanoke, Virginia accidentally shot herself in the leg on Thursday, May 6 during a private event being held inside the gun store. According to local station WDBJ7, the shooting took place just before noon, while the business was closed to the public.Roanoke City Police Department and Roanoke Fire EMS were called to the scene. The shooting victim was transferred to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where she is being treated for non life-threatening injuries.According to a statement released by the company, the injured employee works in an administrative position.The company stated: All of our employees undergo required firearm safety training upon hiring, and this unfortunate incident shows that even experienced firearm owners must be ever-vigilant and aware of the responsibilities associated with safe handling. According to the NRA, guns make for a safer society. Following that line of reasoning, a gun shop should be the safest place in the world. This is just one of many incidents where people have been accidentally or purposely injured by a firearm while surrounded by guns.On January 9, 2015, for example, four people were shot inside a gun store in Shawnee, Kansas.A few months later, a Fayetteville, NC man shot himself in the leg while attending a gun show.In November 2015, two men were shot at a gun show in Idaho when a vendor  accidentally fired a rifle. In January of this year, somewhere between one and three people were shot at a gun show in Ohio. Authorities were unable to determine the exact number of people who were shot at that event.Also in January of this year, two people were killed and two others injured during a father-son shootout at a gun store in Mississippi.All of the people involved in these shootings were surrounded by guns when they were injured or killed. Contrary to what the NRA says, being surrounded by guns does not make a person less likely to get shot. In fact, the opposite is true. The more guns that people have access to, the greater their risk of being injured or killed by one.Featured image via Ratha Grimes via Flickr cc 2.0 ",0
"As there is more and more demand by politicians and Electoral College electors for a bipartisan investigation into Russia s involvement in the 2016 election, our President-elect has very conveniently decided to go into hiding.According to Bloomberg, Trump is unable to handle the heat and rising suspicions so he has canceled his first press conference since his undeserved win. Bloomberg said: President-elect Donald Trump is postponing until next month a previously announced news conference to outline how he ll handle his far-flung business operations while in the White House, according to senior Trump transition officials.Trump had planned to make the announcement Dec. 15 but wants more time because he s been occupied with filling out his cabinet and top administration posts, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. He s preparing to reveal his choice for secretary of state as soon as Tuesday, they said. First of all, all you need to do is look at Trump s Twitter history to know that he hasn t been SO swamped with his cabinet appointments to have a press conference   after all, he still has time to insult people on social media and attend his  victory tour  rallies! This is merely the pathetic excuse Trump s advisors are using to prevent Trump from screwing up even more before the Electoral College has to vote on him in a few days. And of course, Trump s team recognizes that having a press conference where Trump is supposed to address his conflicts of interests and business issues is probably not a good idea right now.The cancellation of this contest marks another first for Trump   he s the first President-elect since 1978 who has not held a press conference after winning the election. In fact, Trump hasn t done any press conferences since July   and ironically he invited Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and leak her emails during that press conference.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri warned on Sunday Lebanon was at risk of Gulf Arab sanctions because of the Shi ite group Hezbollah s regional meddling and said he would return to Lebanon within days to affirm he had resigned as the country s prime minister. In a television interview, the Saudi-allied Hariri held out the possibility he could yet rescind his resignation if Hezbollah agreed to stay out of regional conflicts such as Yemen, his first public comments since he read out his resignation on television from Riyadh eight days ago. He indicated the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese in the Gulf could be at risk, as well as trade, vital to the stability of the Lebanese economy. Hariri said his resignation was intended as a  positive shock  to his country, which he saw in danger. Top Lebanese government officials and senior sources close to Hariri believe Saudi Arabia coerced Hariri into resigning and has put him under effective house arrest since he flew to Saudi Arabia over a week ago.     Ahead of his interview, Lebanese President Michel Aoun said Hariri s movements were being restricted in Saudi Arabia, the first time the Lebanese authorities have publicly declared their belief that Riyadh is holding him against his will. Hariri said he was a free man. The resignation and its aftermath have thrust Lebanon back to the forefront of the conflict between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran. Aoun refused to accept Hariri s resignation unless he tendered it in person in Lebanon. Hariri, who has not returned to Lebanon since he declared his shock resignation, said he stepped down for the sake of the Lebanese national interest, repeatedly saying the country must stick by a policy of  disassociation  from regional conflict.  I am freely in the Kingdom, and if I want to travel tomorrow, I will travel,  Hariri said of his presence in Saudi Arabia. He said he would return to Lebanon within two or three days. When he resigned on Nov. 4, he said he feared assassination. His father, a long-serving former prime minister, was killed by a bomb in 2005. Hariri said he must be sure his security had not been penetrated before returning. Hariri s eyes welled up with tears at one point in the interview. Asked by the interviewer if he would take more questions, Hariri said no because he was tired.   We know there are American sanctions (targeting Hezbollah), but (do) we add to them also Arab sanctions? What is our interest (in that) as Lebanese, because we see today interventions in Yemen and Bahrain by Iran and Hezbollah,  said Hariri. He added:  Disassociation is the foundation of Lebanon s interest. Where do we export our goods, is it not to the Arab states? Where do our sons work ...?       We must work to preserve this interest, and this interest was threatened, so for this reason I did what I did,  he said. He singled out Yemen, where a Saudi-led alliance is bogged down in a war with Iran-allied Houthi rebels, asking what a Lebanese group was doing there, in reference to Hezbollah. Saudi Arabia has accused Hezbollah of a role in firing a ballistic missile from Yemen towards Riyadh earlier this month. In order for him to go back on his resignation, Hariri said the  the diassociation (policy)  must be respected and regional interventions by Hezbollah halted.  Lebanon cannot bear them,  he said. Hezbollah is Lebanon s most powerful group thanks to a powerful arsenal. It has deployed fighters to Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad. The group denies a role in the fighting in Yemen but is fiercely supportive of the Houthis in its statements. Hariri s resignation from abroad and the week of silence that followed has destabilized his country, where Sunni, Shi ite, Christian and Druze factions fought a civil war from 1975-1990, often backed by rival powers around the region. After Hariri announced his resignation, Saudi Arabia accused Lebanon of declaring war against it because of Hezbollah. The Hezbollah leader on Friday said it was Saudi Arabia that had declared war on Lebanon. Western countries including the United States and France have reiterated their long-standing policy of support for the Lebanese government since the Saudi declaration that the Beirut government was a hostile party.     Before Hariri s interview, Aoun said Hariri s situation in Saudi Arabia threw doubt over anything that he had said or would say, and his statements could not be considered as an expression of his full free will. Aoun said Hariri was living in  mysterious circumstances  in Riyadh which had  reached the degree of restricting (his) freedom  and  imposing conditions on his residency and on contact with him even by members of his family .     Saudi Arabia has denied Hariri is being held against his will or that he had been forced to resign. It has advised its citizens not to visit Lebanon and those there to leave as soon as possible. ",1
"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s stock market has shed $6 billion while its main index has slumped 40 percent since last Wednesday when the military seized power leading to the fall of Robert Mugabe, stock exchange data showed on Thursday. The main industrial index was at 315.12 points compared with 527.27 points on Wednesday last week when the military announced its takeover and put former president Mugabe under house arrest. On Thursday the index fell 4.4 percent. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange had been on a rapid rise in the last two months, driven by investors seeking a safe haven for their investment amid fears of a return to hyperinflation in an economy suffering acute shortages of foreign exchange. But analysts said the market had entered a period of correction on investor optimism of a change in economic policy in a post-Mugabe era.  Market capitalization was $9 billion, down from $15 billion last week, bourse data showed. On the currency front, black market rates for buying cash dollars softened further on Thursday.  Buying $100 using electronic transfer cost $150, down from $180 last week. Some black market traders said they were not buying dollars at all, anticipating further softening of rates. Zimbabwe adopted the U.S. dollar in 2009, along with Britain s pound and the South African rand, to tame inflation that topped out at 500 billion percent.   The market is adjusting back to reality,  an analyst at a Harare-based asset management company said.  The gains that we had seen were being fueled by an outlook of a return to hyperinflation, continued isolation of Zimbabwe by international lenders as well as well as a depressed economic outlook.  An analyst at a local stockbrocking firm said Mnangagwa had hit the right notes with his speech on Wednesday. Mnangagwa said he wanted to grow the economy, create jobs and for Zimbabwe to re-engage the international community as the country has faced isolation since 1999 when it defaulted on its debt with the International Monetary Fund. Most of Zimbabwe s 13 million people remain poor and face currency shortages and sky-high unemployment, something Mnangagwa promised to address. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence used a private email account to conduct public business as governor of Indiana, his office said in a statement on Thursday. The private email account was first reported by the Indianapolis Star, which said Pence used it at times to discuss sensitive matters and homeland security issues. The account was hacked last summer, the newspaper added. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Pence criticized Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state, saying it endangered national security. “Similar to previous governors, during his time as Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence maintained a state email account and a personal email account,” Pence’s office said in a statement. Indiana law does not prohibit public officials from using personal email accounts, the Star said. After Pence was hacked in June by a scammer who sent a plea for money to his email contacts, the governor set up a new AOL account, the Star reported. Pence was chosen by then-Republican candidate Donald Trump as his running mate in July. Indiana law requires all records dealing with state business to be retained and available for public information requests, the Star reported. Pence’s office said in the statement that he directed outside counsel to review all of his communications as Indiana governor to ensure that state-related emails were being transferred and properly archived by the state.

" The Democrats have been in Washington DC only because of the negro vote. You put them first, and they put you last. Because you re a chump. A political chump.    Malcolm XIf Malcolm X were alive today, how would he feel about our first  Black President ? How would he feel about Obama encouraging millions of illegal aliens and refugees to come to America and take the jobs of millions of unemployed Americans struggling to find work? The truth of the matter is, Obama will go down as the worst President in history for Blacks in America. While we definitely don t agree with some of the positions Malcolm X took, we do agree that the Democrats have been selling the black community a bill of goods for decades. Perhaps it s time to get off the Democrat Plantation and vote for a candidate who genuinely wants to put every unemployed black citizens back to work. Perhaps its time for someone with no political ties to come in and clean Obama s corrupted house. Larry Elder had a fascinating column discussing Malcolm X and how he really felt about the Democratic Party and black people who voted in lockstep with this party. He even goes on to show how the Democrats have continued to destroy almost every aspect of the black family and how their policies are exactly against what Malcolm X had been advocating.Back in 1964, the black community gave 80 percent of their vote to the Democratic Party. As a result of this, Malcolm X called them  political chumps.  Why? Because the black community had been betrayed by the Democrats. The white vote was so close that they always need to go back and recount, which means that if black people were to stick together, they have the power of determining who is ultimately elected. Still, the Democrats failed to deliver on a promised civil rights bill because they correctly anticipated that they could still count on the black vote and their blind support in the next election.https://youtu.be/7BYVv4LY_KQStrong words indeed. But it also begs the question of what would Malcolm X think about the situation today? Today, it is even worse, with about 90 to 95 percent of the black vote being in lockstep with the Democratic Party. Yet, the Democrats have not kept their promises of family stability, education, and job creation.Over the last 50 years, the black community and its family unity has been completely destroyed. Even when slavery prevented marriage, a black child was more likely to be raised in a  home  with their biological mother and father than today. According to economist Walter Williams, during the period of 1890-1940 a black child was slightly more likely to grow up with married parents than a white child.Back in 1965, 24 percent of black babies were born to unmarried mothers. Then, the  War on Poverty  began and today this number is up to 72 percent. Interesting to see that the more money we supposedly threw at helping the black family, the worse things have become. Plus, it has not helped to reduce the rate of poverty, either. Since 1965 the government has spent nearly $20 trillion fighting poverty. When this started, the poverty rate was 17 percent. After this spending started, the rate began to flat line (it had been consistently going down since 1949 before this) because people learned that they could marry the government and that men could abandon their financial and moral responsibility.Malcolm X was also fond of pointing out how he learned from a good library. Wonder how he would feel today about the Democratic opposition to school vouchers, allowing money to follow the student rather than the school? Urban schools, with predominantly black students, have unquestionably failed. They continue churning out kids who cannot read, write, and compute. The drop out rate approaches 50 percent in some districts. Teachers even send their own kids to private schools.Plus, there is 14 percent black unemployment thanks to our wonderful community organizer in chief. Heck, Emanuel Cleaver (Dem, MO), former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, has admitted that if this had happened under a white president, there would be hell to pay but Obama knows that blacks are going to show him more slack since he black himself.All of this is interesting to think about. It shows us just exactly what the Democrats really think of the black community. They have never been about actually doing something to help and improve the lives of their constituents. Rather, they are only focused on increasing their power. Starting with Kennedy and LBJ, the whole idea was to trap the black vote in a cycle of dependence so that they would need to rely on the government for everything.  DownTrend ",0
"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will consider a variety of responses to Russia’s hacking of political party organizations and it is possible that any action may not be announced publicly, the White House said on Tuesday. “There are a range of responses that are available to the president and he will consider a response that is proportional,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One. “It is certainly possible that the president can choose response options that we never announce,” he said.

"It s painful to watch the stupidity and irresponsibility of the Democrats who run the city of Chicago along with Chicago Teachers Union president, Karen Lewis, one of the most hard-core radical, leftist s in the business. It s T-minus one week for Chicago Public Schools.As schools let out for the summer, CPS administrators are scrambling to come up with a more than $600 million teacher pension payment due at the end of the month and the district has zero reserves, according to media reports.The problem is further compounded by a more than $1 billion school budget shortfall for the next fiscal year and an angry teachers union hell bent on securing another raise the district can t afford. With no plan, no money and no where to turn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel seems to be focused solely on a state bailout as the solution. Springfield has to step up and help in this case, not only as it relates to just the pension payment, (but also) the educational opportunities of our children,  Emanuel said, according to the Chicago Tribune.  Because a payment will then begin to impact   the classroom. And CTU could soon partner with its mortal enemies at City Hall to lobby state lawmakers for more money. Right now, the district needs us,  CTU VP Jesse Sharkey told the news site.  The politics of (Chicago Mayor) Rahm Emanuel going to Springfield are a lot different than the politics of Rahm Emanuel and (CTU President) Karen Lewis going to Springfield. The dire financial situation comes amid a federal investigation into a $20 million no-bid contract to a previous employer of former CPS superintendent Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who resigned this month. It feels like a complete mess,  Better Government Association senior editor Sarah Karp told ABC 7.Karp doesn t think recently elected Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who ran on a platform of fiscal restraint and criticized union influence in Illinois, is receptive to calls for a bailout. He previously suggested that bankruptcy may be the best way out for CPS, ABC 7 reports. Now, Chicago Public Schools does not have somebody in the State House that is a Democrat or is seemingly sympathetic at all to what s going on here,  Karp said.Meanwhile, school ended for the summer on Friday, and principals around the city are left scratching their heads in planning for next school year. Normally you do your planning in the summer and you can t do too much planning without the actual dollar amount,  Coles Language Academy principal Jeff Dase told ABC 7.Dase said many Chicago principals are concerned that the budget turmoil, and looming possibility of layoffs and program cuts, could convince many of the city s teachers to seek jobs elsewhere.The Tribune reports the city council could authorize CPS to increase taxes on residents, or secure some sort of bailout, or negotiate concessions with CTU, but not even all three combined could put the budget back on track. And then there s another $228 million payment coming due for costs related to interest rate swaps on the district s debt.    (E)ven if CPS wins concession from the City Council, state lawmakers and CTU, the district won t be able to close its annual $1 billion budget gap, according to a May 22 report by Ernst & Young, which spent four weeks meeting with school finance officials and analyzing budget documents,  the Tribune reports. The report shows that even with a capital improvement tax, a separate, even-larger property tax increase, additional state aid, increased state funding of teacher pensions, concessions from the CTU and $150 million with of budget cuts, CPS would still face an annual $350 million shortfall. Next June s teacher pension payment is set to balloon to $700 million. Via: EAG News",0
"Wikileaks, which is more a conspiracy enterprise than it is a whistleblowing watchdog these days, put up a poll on Twitter that asked users to tell them which health issue they thought was causing Hillary s coughing fits and  unusual body movements.  All four of their answers have been bandied about by conservatives everywhere, as they try and diagnose Hillary in a frantic attempt to prove she s unfit to be President.They ve since deleted the poll and put a tweet in its place that s supposed to be a sort of retraction and apology, or as close as Wikileaks will ever get to admitting they royally screwed up. However, the Internet is keeping the poll and publishing it everywhere they can. Buzzfeed s Andrew Kaczynski republished a screencap of it while needling Wikileaks about transparency, since that s what Wikileaks was supposed to be about before they turned into conspiracy theorists with a hate-on for Hillary:.@wikileaks deleted their tweet. Obviously in the nature of openness & transparency I have preserved it right here: pic.twitter.com/IdrgFlxP3A  andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) September 11, 2016Wikileaks  apparently didn t like the flack they were catching for that poll, though, and tweeted out their non-apology accordingly: We removed our earlier poll on what people perceive are the reasons for Clinton s medical issues as the possibilities are too speculative.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) September 11, 2016They should know that poll is never going to die, though, and their non-apology is almost as insulting as the poll. They revel in this kind of thing, along with the backlash involved   in fact, they have yet to remove the credit card information of DNC donors from their collection of the hacked emails, despite the outrage over that.Hillary left the 9/11 event she was attending early and appeared to collapse before being helped into a van. Her campaign later revealed that she d been diagnosed with pneumonia, and that she was overheated and dehydrated, which can happen when someone s sick and in the sun. Her doctor later said that she was recovering nicely from this episode.Seeing as how a lot of people have completely forgotten, here s a little reminder that this isn t unprecedented: In 2002, George W. Bush passed out in the White House after eating a pretzel. After eating a pretzel. Apparently, it went down wrong and  stimulated a nerve that decreased his heart rate.  Enough for him to faint.But Hillary momentarily succumbing to an illness while standing in the sun is some sort of scandal. Right.The medical term for what happened to Bush is vasovagal syncope, and it s actually quite common. So are run-of-the-mill respiratory infections that lead to pneumonia when left unchecked, even in presidential candidates. Hillary s schedule has been grueling, to say the least, and yet she s supposed to either be a super woman and never get sick, or admit that even the merest cold means she s too sick to run for President.The haters, however, are looking for any shred of evidence they can find that  proves  Hillary is unfit to serve. Wikileaks decided to take it too far.Featured image by Carl Court/Getty Images",0

"Now that Seahawks star defensive end Michael Bennett s harrowing story of police brutality has gone viral, the cops who arrested him are trying to cover their own asses in a PR-fueled letter to the NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell. In the letter, Detective Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Metro Police Protective Association, asks Goodell to open an investigation into Bennett s allegations, and requests that the commissioner  take appropriate action. The irony is rich in seeing a letter asserting that the LVPD isn t racist, even as the first paragraph of it calls out the NFL for  condoning  Bennett s protest during the national anthem, a stance that only racists take.Bennett s protest, along with that of many players around the league, is specifically against police brutality when dealing with unarmed, innocent black  suspects.  To continue to insist that it is somehow disrespecting to  everything the flag symbolizes  is to ignore that the flag symbolizes justice as well.But the truly disgusting part of Grammas  letter is the reason he and the Las Vegas Police attempt to use as justification for having unlawfully detained Bennett in the first place. Grammas actually asserts that hiding behind a slot machine, then running outside during an episode in which shots are being fired is considered probable cause to arrest Bennett for  suspicious behavior. Guess what, geniuses? If Mike Bennett was running from the cops, you all just proved him right to have done so. He clearly has no gun, obviously isn t the only person in the entire casino hiding from the gunfire, and wasn t even remotely the only person running out the doors   Bennett himself said that  hundreds  of people were staging an exodus from the scene.One would think that maybe the guy with the Super Bowl ring on who kind of looks like Michael Bennett and can leap over a four-foot barrier might not be their suspect.It is my most sincere hope that Bennett and his lawyers not only sue the department, but Detective Grammas personally, for being the kind of dumbass who would send a self-contradictory letter like this in a case where he s clearly just trying to fire back at Bennett s allegations.Featured image via Mat Hayward/Getty Images",0
"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A sudden decision forcing all Congolese nationals to travel on biometric passports from next month has provoked a backlash from lawmakers already vexed by revelations about the documents  high cost. Even though Democratic Republic of Congo sits near the bottom of the U.N. Human Development Index, the passports it introduced in 2015 are among the world s most expensive.  A Reuters investigation in April showed that $60 of their $185 purchase price goes to a company registered in the United Arab Emirates whose owner is believed to be a close relative of Congo President Joseph Kabila. Despite a subsequent outcry, Vice Foreign Minister Aggee Aje Matembo Toto said at the weekend that, from Oct. 16, citizens would no longer be able to use non-biometric passports, some of which are not due to expire until 2020.  Those that tried to would have their document confiscated and replaced with a photocopy, he said in a statement that justified the change on security grounds. The abrupt ban taps into a climate of political instability fed by militia violence since Kabila last December refused to step down at the end of his mandate.  Not only is this decision inopportune but it is ...above all unacceptable in the (current) politico-social context,  Zacharie Bababaswe, a deputy from Kabila s majority coalition wrote in a letter to Aje Matembo Toto. Opposition lawmaker Juvenal Munubo submitted a formal demand for Aje Matembo Toto to give parliament an explanation.  Aside from the withdrawal of this unpopular decision ... no remedy will be able to reduce tensions,  Munubo wrote on Twitter. Congolese citizens expressed displeasure on social media, posting under a hashtag translating as:  Don t touch my passport .  Reports in the Congolese media and by activist groups about the wealth Kabila has accrued over his 16 years in power have also stoked resentment, while his supporters say he and his family have broken no laws.

"Sean Spicer is the former communications man for the Republican National Committee. He will also be joining the communications team for the upcoming Trump Administration, and he is getting a head start by stoking the fires of Trump s ongoing feud with the press. Speaking with The Hill, Spicer whined about how the media treats Trump. He began: There s some positive aspects here and there, but largely it still continues to not treat him with the respect that he deserves. I think for a lot of folks inside the beltway, and inside pundit-world, they don t fully appreciate the understanding that he has of where the American people are. They continue to mock him in ways, when it frankly just shows the lack of understanding that they have of where the American people are and what they think. Spicer then went on to whine about the positive coverage of Democrats in the press, saying: There are countless examples of the media engaging   overtly or covertly   cheering on Democrats and there s no accountability. But it s also not even frowned upon. The thing is, though, the press realizes what the Republican Party doesn t, which is that Trump is a petty, vengeful, lying, unqualified, corrupt Russian stooge who has duped just enough Americans in the right states to be elected president. That does not mean that he is deserving of respect, though. In fact, respect is earned, not given, and Trump has shown the media zero respect. Rightfully, they are giving it back in kind. He has not earned their respect, and therefore should not expect them to roll over and give it to him.Spicer then went on to give the press another reason to be frustrated with Trump, saying that the White House press briefings that they   and the American people   have become so accustomed to might not be the same in a Trump White House: It will be a daily something. When I say  something,  maybe it s a gaggle, maybe it s an on-camera briefing. Maybe we solicit talk radio and regional newspapers to submit questions   because they can t afford to be in Washington   but they still have a question. Maybe we just let the American people submit questions that we read off as well. This is most definitely vague, and when it comes to vague with Team Trump, that is an ominous sign, most likely.Spicer then said that he had spoken with former White House press secretaries, from both major parties, and said of them: Whether Republican or Democrat, every one of these predecessors has been unbelievably generous with their time, counsel and advice. The respect for the institution is one that is shared by all of them. Speaking of former Bill Clinton White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry s saying that perhaps these briefings should no longer be televised, Spicer said: I think his conclusion   his points are right. The second the cameras come on it becomes more of a show than an attempt to be more informative. So, in other words, they want to cut the American people off from knowing the day to day workings of our own government. The talk then turned to Trump s insistence on using Twitter for insults, policy announcements, and everything in between. Many Americans   including Trump s own supporters   believe he needs to stay off Twitter. Spicer, however, scoffed at this notion: I think this is nonsense. I really do. Because at the end of the day the American people want more than anything else is results. And success. And he s delivering already. And I think the American people   the people who have their jobs because of his actions   the taxpayers who have watched him save tax dollars, are appreciative, and I m not too sure they re concerned with the means by which he achieves that. So, in other words, we can look forward to the Tweeter-in-Chief. We already knew that, though. Spicer ended his remarks with words of caution to the press: Journalists and everyone in America has a Constitutional right to express themselves or write what they want to write. But he equally has a right to make sure that the record is set straight, the facts are known, and that people can t just take potshots without being held accountable. So, this war with the media will continue for the next four years. Considering Trump s thin-skinned, vengeful, vindictive nature, this could mean that he and his sycophants use the bully pulpit of the White House to bully journalists and dismantle the First Amendment. Scary times indeed, folks. #RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s federal oversight board voted unanimously on Monday to certify the government’s fiscal turnaround plan, on the condition it be amended to eliminate Christmas bonuses, impose employee furloughs, and further reduce pension spending. The plan, a cornerstone of the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, will serve as the baseline for looming restructuring talks with holders of some $70 billion in debt that has pushed the U.S. territory to the brink of economic collapse. The government can avoid some of the austerity measures, which have sparked protest among Puerto Ricans, if it presents alternative cost-saving measures by April 30, the board said. PROMESA required Governor Ricardo Rossello to present a turnaround blueprint that would require sign-off by the board. The board rejected an initial draft last week, saying it relied on “overly optimistic” economic projections. The latest version rolled back those numbers, boosting the island’s 10-year projected funding gap to $67 billion from $56 billion, and contemplating $39.6 billion in new cash flows from spending cuts and revenue initiatives, up from $33.8 billion in the last plan. The new version forecasts the island would have $800 million a year to service debt, down from $1.2 billion in the draft. “The new plan is modestly worse than the old plan for creditors, as it implies larger haircuts,” Puerto Rico credit analyst Chas Tyson, of KBW Inc, said in a note on Monday. Approval by the board came with conditions: the government must reduce pension spending by 10 percent beginning in 2020, cut Christmas bonuses and implement employee furloughs as soon as July 1 to stave off a short-term cash crunch. The austerity push drew protests outside the meeting in lower Manhattan on Monday, including from teachers who claimed the furloughs would shorten the public school year by the equivalent of two months a year. The government can avoid the furloughs and bonus cuts if it presents the board with a plan by April 30 to shore up liquidity by $200 million. Rossello said he was confident the cuts would not be necessary. “I’m very confident we’ll have $200 million in reserve cash, so that we can jump over that obstacle,” Rossello said in an interview with Reuters after Monday’s meeting. The board said it will negotiate over the next 30 days with the government on how to cut pensions, a contentious issue on an island where retirement systems are already borderline insolvent thanks to decades of mismanagement by governments that routinely made overly generous promises to workers. “All stakeholders have been forced to sacrifice, and no one is exempt from that,” board member Andrew Biggs, a pension expert, told reporters after the meeting. He added the cuts will be orchestrated “in a way that would spare the lowest-income people from any reductions.” Rossello said he will not pass public policy that would hurt the poorest pensioners. “I don’t see any way I can reduce pensions of people already having a hard time getting medications and things.” In another controversial move, the board said it supported government efforts to seek additional concessions from bondholders of Puerto Rico’s power utility, PREPA, which is more than $8 billion in debt. The utility and its creditors have had a tentative restructuring in place for more than a year, but Rossello’s administration has said it would seek new terms, sparking concern and frustration among PREPA’s creditors. A subcommittee of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources announced it will hold a hearing on March 22 on the status of the PREPA deal, the current version of which sees creditors taking 15-percent cuts.

"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian authorities scrapped an annual beer festival on Monday after an Islamist party objected to the event that had been planned for the first weekend of October in the country s capital. Though there are plenty of beer drinkers among the sizable Chinese and Indian minorities, protests against events deemed to be  western  and unIslamic - such as concerts and festivals involving alcohol - are common in Muslim-majority Malaysia and are usually led by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) said in a short statement on Monday that it has rejected the application for a permit by the organizers of the  Better Beer Festival 2017  to host the event, which would have entered its sixth year.  If the organizers continue with the event without DBKL s approval, action will be taken in accordance to existing laws,  city hall said. Mybeer (M) Sdn Bhd, the company organizing the event, said in a separate statement that they were informed by DBKL officials that the decision was made  due to the political sensitivity surrounding the event . A member of PAS  central committee, Riduan Mohd Nor, said in a statement on Sept. 10 that there is no guarantee that such events would not lead to criminal acts, rape and free sex. Opponents of the beer festival also launched a campaign on Facebook to block the event. Around 6,000 people had been expected to attend the two-day festival, which would have featured craft beers from at least 11 countries, according to Facebook posts by the organizers and local news reports.

"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Many Syrian refugees in Germany have resigned themselves to the reality that there will be no swift return to the land of their birth, where a civil war is nearing the start of its eighth year. They are starting to build new lives in their host country, driving up demand for  Made in Syria  goods there as they seek to soothe homesickness with a precious slice of their old lives. Products popular among the half a million Syrians, who mainly arrived over the last three years, range from nuts, sweets and sesame paste to clothes, vertical spinning grillers used to make shawarma meat in diners and hair removal wax.  People want the very same things they were used to in Syria,  said trader Anas Msouty, sitting in his dim underground office near Hamburg Port as workers sorted out parcels of baklawa sweets and clothes that had just arrived from Syria.  The German market is full of similar products from Turkey, but Syrians want Syrian (goods),  added the father-of-six, who had to abandon his Islamic women s clothing factory outside Damascus when he fled the country. Orders have grown 25-fold since Msouty set up his trading firm Sajeda three months after his arrival in Germany in early 2016. He now imports 25 tonnes of Syrian goods a month. He is not alone in capitalizing on this trend; dozens of Syrian restaurants, stores and supermarkets have sprung up in all major German cities over the past two years, with more opening every month. In Berlin alone, at least half a dozen new Syrian eateries and as many supermarkets have opened this year.  The rise in demand for Syrian goods is contributing to a gradual revival in Syrian exports to Germany, which has taken in more Syrian refugees than any other Western nation. Exports from Syria rose to 15.5 million euros ($17.9 million) in 2016 and totaled 8 million euros in the first five months of this year alone, according to official German data. This is still a far cry from the pre-war level when non-oil Syrian exports to Germany totaled around $100 million a year. More than 5 million Syrians - almost a quarter of the pre-war population - have fled the Middle Eastern nation, according to the United Nations. It is unclear how much support rising demand for Syrian goods among refugee populations in Germany and elsewhere may be having on Syria s shattered economy. Little data is available from the war zone. The revival in trade in Germany nonetheless appears to have coincided with a bottoming out of economic activity in Syria.  The World Bank estimates the country s gross domestic product contracted by an accumulated 61 percent in 2011-2015, but in 2016 it shrunk by only 2 percent, though it mainly puts the improvement down to a slowing in the population exodus. Msouty, who supplies Syrian individuals and businesses in Germany, said he was proud of his contribution to recovering Syrian exports, which he said is providing much-needed income to factory owners and workers in Syria.  We are resuscitating the Syrian economy,  he said.  In Berlin, the boulevard of Sonnenallee - dubbed  Arab Street  for its abundance of Arabic shop signs - has become one of the most popular shopping destinations and hangouts for the capital s Syrian refugees. It boasts three Syrian supermarkets, two Syrian restaurants and one Syrian sweet shop, which have all opened over the past two years.  This is just a smell of home,  said Houda Bayyad, a veiled young mother shopping at one of the supermarkets, which opened in recent weeks.  It doesn t solve our problems like learning German and finding a job. But it makes our life here easier,  said the 20-year-old, holding a jar of Makdous, a Syrian delicacy of baby aubergines stuffed with walnuts, garlic and sun-dried red peppers pickled in olive oil.  Most Syrian goods come from factories in areas under government control mainly in and around Damascus but also from Aleppo. Three companies in Damascus that supply Msouty with goods declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The products are transported in trucks through relatively safe areas under government control to the port of Latakia in northern Syria and loaded onto container ships bound for Hamburg. Other products come by plane via Beirut. This trade is proving indispensable for Syrians setting up  businesses in Germany.  Sweet shops, and coffee and nut roasters, need specialized machines to make sweet and salty delights such as baklawa and roasted kernels. They prefer to import equipment from Syria as it is cheaper than to buy them in Germany from European or Turkish manufacturers. Restaurateurs depend on specialty raw ingredients to recreate the flavors that Syrians crave. L Amira Falafel, a Syrian restaurant in Hamburg that opened in 2015, has proved so popular that it has now opened at a second location in the northern city.   Our main goal was to make sure that everything we prepare tastes like in Syria,  said Mohammad Abou Saeed, co-owner of the eateries where it is hard to find a table any time of the day.  To do that we needed the same sesame paste, pickles and spices we used in Syria,  he added, gesturing at a waiter to bring baked bread to a couple who had just walked in.   It makes us very happy when diners tell us our food reminds them of Syria.   ",1

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has begun returning to Congress copies of a voluminous 2014 report describing the CIA’s harsh detention and interrogation programs, U.S. officials said on Friday. The Trump administration’s move means it could be more difficult for the full, 6,700-page report to be made public, because documents held by Congress are exempt from laws requiring government records to eventually be made public. The White House made the move in response to requests by Sen. Richard Burr, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s current Republican chairman, officials said. In a statement emailed to Reuters, Burr said: “I have directed my staff to retrieve copies of the Congressional study that remain with the Executive Branch agencies and, as the Committee does with all classified and compartmented information, will enact the necessary measures to protect the sensitive sources and methods contained within the report.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat who chaired the committee when the report was produced, had asked that it be distributed to multiple executive branch agencies, a move designed to make it eventually releasable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act law. Feinstein said in a statement that she was “concerned and disappointed” that Burr requested that the document be returned, calling it a departure from the committee’s normal bipartisan nature. “No senator, chairman or not, has the authority to erase history. I believe that is the intent of the chairman in this case,” she said.  Sen Mark Warner, who succeeded Feinstein as the committee’s top Democrat, said in a Twitter post he was “disappointed” with Burr’s decision, and that the report “must be preserved so we can learn from past mistakes & ensure that abuses are never repeated.” A declassified executive summary of the report was made public in December 2014. It concluded that the CIA’s interrogation programs, using techniques such as waterboarding that most observers consider torture, were more brutal and less effective than the CIA had told policymakers. The report said that not a single terrorist attack was foiled as a result of the use of harsh interrogation techniques. The American Civil Liberties Union had filed litigation to have the full report released. But U.S. courts ruled that because the document was created by Congress, it was exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. At least one copy of the report, however, will not be returned to the committee. That’s because a copy has been preserved in former President Barack Obama’s presidential archive, according to a Dec. 9, 2016 letter written to Feinstein by Obama’s top White House lawyer at the time, W. Neil Eggleston. The CIA declined to comment. Burr’s move was first reported by the New York Times. ",1
"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s police monitor said on Monday investigations into the alleged killings by police of a girl and a baby in election-related violence were complete, and a spokesman said the case would probably end up in court. Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.  Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed associated with the August election, which was later voided by the Supreme Court, and in unrest surrounding the re-run of the presidential vote last month.  Stephanie Moraa, an 8-year-old girl in the Nairobi slum of Mathare, died after being hit by a stray bullet as police fired to disperse protesters on Aug. 12, the day after election results were announced. And the parents of six-month-old Samantha Pendo said she was teargassed and clubbed by police who invaded their home in Kisumu looking for protesters.  On Monday, the government-funded but civilian-run Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) said it had forwarded its findings and recommendations to the director of public prosecutions  for review and direction . Asked on Monday what IPOA had recommended to the prosecutor s office regarding the two deaths, spokesman Dennis Oketch said:  It s a matter which will most likely end up in court. We don t want to give any information that can become prejudicial. We will wait for the [prosecutor s] review.  IPOA s statement did not specify if it had identified suspects in the two deaths. It did not mention any other investigations into election-related violence.  It has however, completed another investigation into alleged police beatings at a demonstration in September at Kenya s oldest university that sparked opposition anger at what they see as a pattern of police brutality.  IPOA said it had recommended to a police service commission that it take  stern disciplinary action against the responsible Commander . It had also forwarded the investigation file to the prosecutor s office, the statement read. Shortly after the August election, IPOA said it was fast-tracking investigations of all deaths and injuries for which the police were alleged by rights groups to be responsible.  Kenyan police dispute those accounts. The National Police Service described a report last month by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International on 33 deaths in Nairobi during the crackdown as  totally misleading and based on falsehoods . Despite its history of police brutality, Kenya is an economic and transport hub in East Africa and important Western ally against militant Islam that receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors, including the United States and Britain. The IPOA was set up in 2011 after the killings of around 1,200 people in violence following the disputed 2007 election. It has received more than 9,000 complaints of police brutality and corruption since then.  Last year, it secured its first conviction, of two police officers sentenced for the death of a 14-year-old girl shot dead during a house raid in 2014. A survey last year by the non-profit International Police Science Association ranked Kenya s police force as the 125th worst-performing out of 127 national police forces studied. Only forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria did worse, measured on factors such as  process  and  legitimacy.  ",1
"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A proposal by the U.S. Senate to change the way shares in startup companies are taxed incited panic and dread in Silicon Valley on Monday, with startup founders and investors warning of nothing less than the demise of their industry should the proposal become law. The provision in the Senate’s tax reform plan, which appeared to catch the industry by surprise, involves the treatment of employee stock options. These options give the holder the right to purchase shares in the future at a set price and can be very valuable if a company does well and the share price increases. Options are often a major portion of the compensation for  startup employees and founders, who take lower salaries in anticipation of a big payout if their startup takes off. Options typically vest over a four-year period. Senate Republicans have now proposed taxing those stock options as they vest and before startup employees have the opportunity to cash them in, resulting in annual tax bills that could easily climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, say startup founders and venture capitalists. “If there were a single piece of legislation to adversely affect startups, it would be this,” said Venky Ganesan, managing director at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. “Everyone is freaked out.” Justin Field, vice president of government affairs at the National Venture Capital Association, said that the Senate’s proposed tax change would be “crippling” to the startup industry. How far the provision gets remains to be seen. The National Venture Capital Association was successful in getting a similar proposal removed from the House tax bill, although it “didn’t fully appreciate” the Senate’s intention to add the tax provision, Field said. The association also helped to steer lawmakers away from a proposal discussed late last year to tax venture capitalists’ profits on investments at a higher rate. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, has filed an amendment to repeal the provision in the tax bill, according to his spokesman.  Under current tax code, employees are taxed only when they exercise their options. Options are exercised when the price they were granted at—known as the strike price—is lower than the share price, and some shares can then be sold to pay the taxes. But the Senate proposal would require startup employees to pay regular income tax on the value gain of their stock options even before they are exercised. These options are illiquid assets, and cannot be spent or saved. “What this would mean is every month, when your equity compensation vests a little bit, you will owe taxes on it even though you can’t do anything with that equity compensation,” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist with Union Square Ventures, wrote on his blog Monday. For instance, if a startup employee receives stock options at a dollar per share, and the shares increase in value by $1 every year during the four-year vesting period, the employee would have to pay income tax on $1 per share after the first year, pay again on the $1 increase in value after the second year, and so on. When that employee owns hundreds of thousands and even millions of shares, that is a hefty bill to pay. And there is always the risk the startup will eventually fail. “This reform will force the average employee to pay taxes on that bet well before they even know if it’s a winning ticket,” said Amanda Kahlow, founder and executive chairman of marketing data startup 6sense. For startup founders in particular, such a tax bill could be ruinous.  “It would mean that I would have to sell the company,” said Shoaib Makani, founder and chief executive of long-haul trucking startup KeepTruckin. “I have zero net worth aside from the common stock I hold in the company. It would be impossible. I would be in default.” Some executives in the startup industry, however, have pushed for companies to move toward bigger salaries so employees are not so dependent on options to buy a house or pay for other large expenses. And when startups suffer valuation cuts, employees can end up with worthless options. The Senate’s proposal came as a revenue-generating measure to help offset tax breaks in the bill. A spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, did not respond to requests for comment and other Republicans on the committee were not immediately available.  A spokeswoman for Senator Ron Wyden, the committee’s ranking member and a Democrat, said he was aware of concerns that the provision would limit startups’ ability to attract talent. ",1

"I wonder how many of J.B. Pritzker s children or grandchildren will be forced to share locker rooms or bathrooms at the country club with men or women of the opposite sex?

Some on the right even used (gasp!) facts to bolster their argument. Like the fact that,  a TINY .01% of  the population  are actually affected by a federal transgender bathroom law:Draconian federal regulation is unneeded. We're talking about a TINY .01% of population. Let schools deal with this directly!  Nicole4Trump (@niteowlmom3) February 23, 2017The tweet immediately provoked criticism from liberals. Illinois State Rep. Will Guzzardi (D., Chicago), a supporter of the Obama rule, said that Pritzker s tweet was insensitive and mischaracterized the transgender bathroom and locker room debate. No disrespect  @JBPritzker but it s actually about precisely *not* that. We just want to let kids use their own gender s bathroom,  Guzzardi tweeted in response.  Your idea suggests that we support ppl going into opposite-gender bathrooms, which plays right into transphobic rhetoric. Pritzker has been called  the other mayor of Chicago  for his political influence and massive campaign spending on behalf of Democratic candidates such as Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel. He has close ties to the Clintons, having served as the national co-chair of Hillary Clinton s failed 2008 presidential bid, as well as the Obama administration. His sister, Penny Pritzker, served as Secretary of Commerce under President Obama from 2013 until he left office. J.B. Pritzker and his wife were two of the largest individual spenders in the 2016 election, shelling out more than $21 million to elect Clinton and other Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Pritzker has now set his sights on the Illinois governor s mansion and is exploring the idea of self-funding a campaign. Rauner self-financed a $40 million campaign run in 2014, which helped him overcome steep Democratic advantages in the deep blue state.Other Democrats vying for the nomination were quick to criticize Pritzker s protest idea.

The guy has an incredible resume on Wiki:Michael S. Rogers (born October 31, 1959) is a United States Navy admiral who serves as Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Commander of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Chief of the Central Security Service (CSS) since April 3, 2014. Prior to that, Rogers served as the Commander of the Tenth Fleet and Commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command.Rogers is a native of Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from New Trier High School in 1977. He is a graduate of Auburn University (1981) and the Naval War College.Rogers received his commission through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) program and has served in the United States Navy since graduating from Auburn University in 1981. He started his career as a Surface Warfare Officer working in naval gunfire support operations off Grenada, Beirut, and maritime surveillance operations off El Salvador. In 1986, he was selected for transfer from Unrestricted Line Officer to Restricted Line Officer and re-designation as a cryptology officer.During the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Rogers joined the military s Joint Staff, which works for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he specialized in computer network attacks. From 2007 onward he served as director of intelligence for the military s Pacific Command. In 2009, he became director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was subsequently named commander of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet, with responsibility for all of the Navy s cyberwarfare efforts. As such, Rogers was the first restricted line officer to serve as a numbered fleet commander and the first Information Warfare Community (IWC) officer to achieve the rank of vice admiral.In January 2014, the Obama Administration announced Rogers  nomination as director of the National Security Agency and the commander of the US offensive cyberoperations unit in the Department of Defense. Rogers succeeded General Keith B. Alexander, who served as the NSA director for nine years, and became the first IWC officer to achieve the rank of admiral. Although the NSA directorship does not require Senate approval, Rogers had to be confirmed by the Senate to head United States Cyber Command,[11] for which the Senate unanimously confirmed him.In his first public remarks as NSA director, Rogers stated that he believed that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was  probably not  working for a foreign intelligence agency, despite frequent speculation and assertion by the NSA s allies to the contrary. Rogers added:  He clearly believes in what he s doing. I question that; I don t agree with it. I fundamentally disagree with what he did. I believe it was wrong; I believe it was illegal. The Washington Post reported on 19 November 2016 that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper Jr. had recommended to President Obama that Rogers be terminated as director of the National Security Agency. Carter reportedly recommended he be terminated due to poor performance, whereas Clapper considered it wise that the position be held by a civilian. Both Clapper and Carter had put Rogers on notice for poor performance in internal security and for a poor leadership style. His termination was reportedly delayed due to stalled changes to the bureaucratic structure of the intelligence community. Later, Rogers reportedly met with then President-elect Donald Trump without notifying his supervisors in what is an unprecedented action for a military officer. Trump was reportedly considering replacing Clapper with Rogers as DNI, however that position went to former Senator Dan Coats, with Rogers remaining NSA director.",0
"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian police will create a national photo database using existing identification records held by state authorities to identify terror suspects, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Thursday, fanning privacy concerns among rights groups. Turnbull said the database was intended to accelerate the process of identifying potential terror suspects, replacing a time-consuming system that could take up to a week when national authorities requested information from their state counterparts.  It shouldn t take seven days to be able to verify someone s identity or seek to match the photo of someone who is a person of interest,  Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.  It should be done seamlessly and in real time,  he said. The biometric database stops short of enabling real-time detection of suspects by scanning large crowds and alerting authorities when people on a security watch list are identified, similar to a system in place in China. China leads the world in the use of facial detection, even allowing education authorities to use the system to catch students cheating on exams, but Australia will limit the new database to police and intelligence agencies only. Turnbull said the system would not be connected to Australia s existing network of closed-circuit televisions, easing fears that authorities were seeking to create an automated system of detection. Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, is on heightened alert after a series of  lone wolf  attacks in recent years, and has sent troops to fight alongside the United States and other allies in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is also on alert for dozens of home-grown radicals returning after fighting for Islamic State and other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. Turnbull said police were hampered by the current outdated, state-based system but Fergus Hanson, head of international cyber policy center at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the new biometric system raised concerns about potential abuses of power.  I think most Australians would agree that using facial recognition to track down terrorists is a good idea,  he said.  People might say using it for tracking down murderers is a good idea, but what about people who haven t paid their parking fine?  Hanson said. The new database was unveiled as Turnbull met state leaders and announced Australia would now double the length of time terror suspects could be held by police to two weeks after their arrest. Australia s detention laws came into focus earlier this year with the arrest of four men on suspicion of planning an  Islamic inspired  plot to bring down a passenger plane. ",1
"(Reuters) - Russian cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab said on Thursday that it has expanded its relationship with global law enforcement agency Interpol, agreeing to share threat data to help police fight cyber crime.  The company disclosed the agreement as the Kremlin dismissed claims by several U.S. newspapers that Israeli intelligence officials had determined that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky s software for espionage. The reports were the latest in a series alleging the company and its founder, Eugene Kaspersky, have close ties to the Kremlin. Reuters has not been able to validate those claims.  Kaspersky has repeatedly said it has not helped Russia or any other government engage in espionage.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday the Russian government believes the allegations against Kaspersky are without merit. He said that allegations, in articles in the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, were  absurd.    The government has not had and does not have any connection to such activity,  he said.  The accusations are ungrounded and unproven.  ",1

"Donald Trump is now alleging that the United States presidential election will be rigged against him. As per usual, Trump s allegations are not supported by any compelling evidence. His supporters have decided that the election will be swayed in Clinton s favor by the big scary liberal media. Trump campaign top advisor, Rudy Guiliani, repeated these claims during an interview on ABC New s This Week Sunday morning.Non-stop conspiracy theories about the media s bias against Trump are a response to Trump s plummeting polling numbers which show that Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is enjoying a comfortable lead.This Week Co-Host, Martha Raddatz, presented a remark that Newt Gingrich had given to the Washington Post: The current race is which of these two is the more unacceptable, because right now, neither of them is acceptable. Trump is helping her to win by proving he is more unacceptable than she is. Raddatz then asks Guiliani,  Is that the way you see it? Guiliani responds, saying that no he does not see it the same way as Gingrich does. He then claims that the media has not hit Clinton as hard as it has hit Trump. According to Guiliani, this is evidenced by the negative media attention that Trump has received during his feud with the Khan family, compared to the media attention that Clinton received because of Benghazi. And I think her comments   Hillary s comments   just don t get the same attention that Trump s do. For example, she lied to a Gold Star mother. She lied to pre   Patricia Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, who   who was killed at Benghazi, I believe, because of her incompetence, her incompetence in failing to secure that mission. And she lied to her on September 14th, 2012, right at the coffin. She said it was due to a video. So I think that s far more serious or at least it said get as much attention as all of the attention that was paid to, you know, the comments that were made about the Khan family. Ah, the press isn t talking enough about Clinton and Benghazi. That s why Trump s campaign is floundering. It couldn t possibly be that Trump is a loudmouth asshat who decided it would be a grand idea to repeatedly insult the family of a deceased war hero, could it?Trump supporters will say anything to try and rationalize away the fact that Trump is a dangerous man who cannot bully his way into the White House.You can watch the segment below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2DClsluYx8Featured image from video screenshot",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States believes progress with China on a range of trade issues has become more difficult and Beijing appears on a  trajectory of retrenchment,  a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday. President Donald Trump will insist in upcoming talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping that more balance is needed in U.S.-Chinese trade relations, the official said, briefing reporters ahead of Trump s Nov. 3-14 Asia trip that will include a stop in Beijing. Trump s Asia tour is shaping up to be the longest by an American president in 25 years. With tensions aboil over North Korea s nuclear challenge, Trump leaves on Friday on a trip with stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. While in South Korea, Trump will speak to U.S. and South Korea troops, but time constraints will preclude a stop at the demilitarized zone, the border region that separates North and South Korea, another senior official said. The official s remarks on the U.S.-Chinese trade relations could herald some friction in Trump s talks with Xi on a state visit to Beijing that comes just as Xi consolidated power in a Communist Party congress. Trump has repeatedly complained about the U.S. trade deficit with China, which was $347 billion in 2016. But he has shied away from taking major punitive trade actions against China. The official said over the long-term China must provide fair and reciprocal treatment to U.S. and international companies and stop  predatory trade and investment practice.   Progress on a range of bilateral economic issues has become increasingly difficult. We believe this reflects a slowdown and even a retrenchment in China s move toward a market-oriented economy,  the official said. On Monday, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai predicted in a briefing with reporters that  there will be significant outcomes on the economic side  while Trump is in Beijing. Cui said countries cannot look simply at trade balance and imbalance because what is behind those numbers is important and  very complicated.  He called the U.S. trade deficit a  structural problem  that cannot be resolved overnight. While on his trip Trump will also hold his first face-to-face meeting with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of the Association of South East Asia Nations summit being held in Manila. Despite a history of anti-American rhetoric, one of the administration officials said Trump and Duterte have developed a  warm rapport.  ",1
"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The surprise emergence of a billionaire real estate developer who has proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States as the front runner to become Republican nominee for president is one of the hot topics of conversation among the rich and powerful at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. While calling Donald Trump “unbelievable”, “embarrassing” or even “dangerous”, business executives and finance leaders said he had nevertheless “hit a vein” with his direct talk. Here are some of the comments about Donald Trump heard this week at the annual gathering: Rodrigo Valdes, finance minister of Chile, on rhetoric in the U.S. Presidential election: “Clearly it is not a rhetoric that is inviting for integration. In Chile we have a deep view that integration of the Americas is a good thing, whether it is goods, financing and yes people. So I’d be happier with a more welcoming rhetoric. It is uncontroversial to say that integration of markets, of trade is a good thing and this rhetoric does not help that.” Sandeep Dadlani, executive vice president of Indian outsourcing firm Infosys: “Infosys has been getting the majority of its revenues from the US market for  over 30 years and we have seen many elections come and go. It is common in all election seasons for rhetoric and extreme personalities to shine. Inevitably we have found governments from both sides to eventually come up with sensible policies.” Huffington Post news website founder Arianna Huffington: “I feel the mainstreaming of Donald Trump, instead of him being treated as an extreme, dangerous candidate is really the most troubling aspect of American politics right now. “He’s being interviewed on all the main shows, and he’s being asked questions about what his first State of the Union address would be like if he wins, instead of actually being forced to answer the tough questions about his policy, especially his policy of wanting to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., which is so dangerous, so un-American and should really be the center of the coverage of Trump.  “We (at Huffington Post) first covered him as entertainment, as a sort of buffoonish figure. But the day he announced that policy we switched to cover him as a clear and present danger to the American political system and to America and its values.  “I think the GOP (Republican party) is in real trouble if he becomes the lead candidate. But there’s a long way between now and the nominating convention.”  Dominic Barton, global managing director for business consultancy McKinsey: “This is a political campaign that’s become entertainment. I almost feel like anything you ask, Trump will have some radically different view. If I were to say it takes 9 months to make a baby, he could say ‘that’s crap, it should take 3’ or something.” “It’s a bit embarrassing globally. But I think there’s a big difference between the rhetoric and the reality, and I think most people will see that and discount it. But it’s incredible how long its been going for. It’s just unbelievable.” Ray Nolte, chief investment officer, Skybridge Capital, a $13 billion hedge fund: “Is Donald going to be the nominee? I don’t know. It’s sure looking that way now. “The takeaway from here, is that anyone here who is in the mainstream say there is no way he could possibly get the nomination. When I hear that, it probably means it is going to happen. “Among the historic party elites, none of them can believe what is going on. If you had gone into the campaigns, a Bush campaign and Rubio campaign, they were saying: ‘We don’t need to pay attention to Trump. The guy is a buffon, he is a clown, he will blow himself up’. This was back 6/7 months ago, that was the narrative.” John McFarlane, chairman of Barclays: “You have an election in the US that has taken a rather strange turn.” “Is Trump going to get the nomination? People would argue No but then ... he is very popular.” Eric Cantor, former Republican majority leader in U.S. House of Representatives, now vice-chairman of Moelis & Co, an investment bank: “He’s not serious. He’s amazing at promoting his personal brand and reflecting an underlying anger at home that is connected to a slow-growth economy where wage stagnation is real. “But Trump Fever is an unsustainable phenomenon that will not translate into a victory for the candidate.” Rob Torres, managing director of Google Travel:     “I think the majority of folks underestimate the Trump power right now.”      “If for some reason he is elected into office, hopefully he will be smart enough to surround himself with folks who have experience in government.” Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of private equity group Blackstone, told CNBC’s Squawkbox that if the Republican presidential race came down to Trump versus Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator from Texas also seen as representing the right wing of the Republican Party, he would go with his fellow billionaire. “If I had to do one, I would do Donald,” he said. Noting the rise of self-proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders as a challenger to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party’s nomination, he said:         “The question is, what is everyone protesting about?... What’s needed actually is a cohesive, healing presidency, not one that’s lurching either to the right or to the left.” Mark Weinberger, global chairman and chief executive of consultancy EY: “I think Donald trump clearly has hit a vein of the American people in straight talk, candor, and saying clearly what he’s going to do. “When you get to the second and third questions on some of the policies he’s raising, I think people are going to have to look a lot more at it and understand it before they pull a curtain and they’re actually gonna vote for someone who’s anti establishment.” ",1
"Nothing to see here just Obama evening the playing field by giving an ad hoc international tribunal the ability to overrule US laws and allow them to levy fines against the US the American taxpayer would be responsible for paying. It is really worrisome,  said top House Ways and Means Committee Democrat Rep. Sandy Levin.  Countries do not want to give away their jurisdiction away to some arbitrary panel,  he added.At issue is the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty and a provision called  Investor-State Dispute Settlement,  or ISDS, that would let foreign firms challenge U.S. laws, potentially overruling those laws and resulting in fines to be paid by taxpayers. The provisions are becoming common in some trade deals between other nations.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has warned that it would undermine U.S. sovereignty.Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions has also raised a concern about another phase in the legislation,  living agreement.  He and other experts say that phrase means that the treaty can be changed after Congress approves it.The Asia trade deal would be up first if Congress OK s the pending Trade Promotion Authority, which fast-tracks trade agreements. Levin said it is in trouble over concerns about the secret TPP.Is anyone else feeling exhausted by watching Josh  the liar  Earnest explain the corrupt Obama administration?At a media breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, Levin appeared with Jeffrey Sachs, prominent international economist at Columbia University, who panned the provision as a bid by foreign companies to make an  end run  around tough U.S. laws and regulations. Essentially, ISDS allows companies to sue states in a special ad hoc tribunal that is outside the court systems and outside of the legal systems of the host countries,  he warned.  U.S. law, U.S. court findings, could be set aside by this ad hoc process really designed and pushed by the corporate sector which sees this as an end run around national law,  he added.Levin also joined in Sessions  demand that the Asia trade pact be opened to the public. Currently, it is being kept in secret and only those cleared to see it are allowed to. Levin said, for example, that he was barred from discussing some TPP provision with Sachs.The White House has dismissed the secrecy claims, but Sachs said,  It is secret. I haven t seen it. I can t see it. Levin also said that the treaty would include communist Vietnam which has far different worker rights laws than the U.S. He recalled recently meeting with a Vietnamese woman who was thrown in jail for trying to form a union.  There has to be changes,  he demanded.Via: Washington Examiner",0
"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), seeking to soften its image before Austrians go to the polls next month, offered only lukewarm praise on Monday for a record election showing by its sister party in neighboring Germany. The Alternative for Germany (AfD), which says immigration threatens German culture, shocked the establishment by winning 12.6 percent in Sunday s national ballot, becoming the first far-right party to enter parliament in more than half a century. Its close Austrian equivalent, the FPO, has lost its lead in opinion polls to the conservative People s Party, led by 31-year-old Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, who has made a hard line on immigration one of his hallmarks.  But tensions between the conservatives and their coalition partners, the Social Democrats, before Austria s Oct. 15 parliamentary election mean the FPO has arguably its best chance of entering national government since its leader Heinz-Christian Strache took over the reins 12 years ago. Strache said on Monday the AfD s showing was  a huge success , but added a note of caution.   We agree (with the AfD) when it comes to analyzing the problems but not necessarily regarding the solutions. There are differences indeed,  Strache told broadcaster ORF, without elaborating.  The AfD is a very young party which is, if you like, still in its infancy.  The Freedom Party was founded in the 1950s by former Nazis, an aspect of its history the party argues is no longer relevant to its policies. It has positioned itself as staunchly anti-Islam but now courts Jewish voters, with apparently limited success. Strache has called anti-Semitism  a crime against humanity , but Austria s main Jewish group says the FPO is xenophobic and divisive. While the AfD also denies being a Nazi party, one of its leading candidates, Alexander Gauland, said this month that Germans should take pride in what their soldiers achieved during World Wars One and Two.    They (the FPO) are clearly setting themselves apart from Gauland s rhetoric,  political analyst Peter Hajek said of Strache s remarks. The AfD leadership cracked within hours of its electoral success on Monday when Frauke Petry, the highest-profile figure in its more moderate wing, stormed out of its victory news conference and abandoned its parliamentary group.

"Liberal actor and close friend of Hillary Clinton, Ben Affleck, came out with a statement of disappointment over another one of his close friends, the disgraced sexual predator, and Hollywood kingpin producer, Harvey Weinstein.After Affleck released his statement of shock over the Weinstein allegations, he was quickly shot down by actress Rose McGowan who claimed he knew all about Harvey Weinstein s antics, despite his statement of fake outrage and disgust.

"Lauren Southern is one tough reporter. She s not afraid to jump into the middle of the fire in order to get the truth out to Americans who rely on unreliable leftist sources of information like NYT s, The Huffington Post, PBS, The Washington Post,  CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS. She starts out her video sarcastically telling her viewers,  As we know, right-leaning viewers like myself are some of the most gullible people on the planet.  Southern then tells readers not to worry because, Our corporate masters are so kind and helpful, making sure no wrong thing gets through to our little ignorant minds.  She tells viewers not to worry, us half-wits  are in good hands, because social media corporations like Facebook and Google are helping you out by  cracking down on fake news sources  by using leftist sources like Snopes and Politfact to tell you what you should, and should not believe:  I don t know about you, but once I found out about this amazing system, I realized just how lucky I am that now only myself or any other simpletons online will fall for lies ever again.   Sometimes  fake news  doesn t just blow up in the metaphorical sense, where everyone shares it around on social media, but literally as well. In 1993 NBC actually rigged a truck with explosives in order to claim  General Motors vans were likely to catch on fire after crashing. Lauren has a few tips for Americans who are sick and tired of being told which news people should, or should not believe in. Southern starts out her video rant by pointing out how  fortunate  we are to have large corporations who she identifies as our  corporate masters with a liberal bent telling  right-leaning voters like myself, who are some of the most gullible people on the planet what is and isn t  fake news.' Southern warns against trusting that a group of left-leaning social media corporations have your best interests in mind when they hire leftist organizations to tell you what news you should or should not believe. She asks her viewers:  With all of the fake news that is floating around, what are we supposed to do? Well, it seems like we have 2 options: The first one is to stop reading the news permanently. We all know the corporate media will lie to you for profit. Google is filtering what we see. Facebook is surpassing stories that have a conservative bent and stops them from trending at all. I personally prefer option 2 where Facebook and Google and whoever else can just stop pretending to be the complete arbiters of truth with their stupid filters and promises of  objectivity  and go let s back to using our own heads to discern what is and is not a real news story, and compare and contrast facts provided by all news sites from all political viewpoints. It s not that hard. So Facebook, Google and all the rest of you who want to control our news, why don t you guys just screw off! By the way, it s not just Facebook and Google that are helping you to decide what you should and shouldn t believe, Twitter and Youtube are joining in to help viewers determine what content that users post on their social media platforms they deem  reliable  or  unreliable.  Behind the curtain, you will likely find hosts from CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC clapping their hands like seals, as this effort to shut down alternate media sources is beginning to effect revenue streams of top conservative sites like Breitbart News. Like a  Scarlett Letter,  advertisers are now using lists provided to them by leftist organizations to determine who they should or should not advertise with. And since there are very few (if any) left-leaning websites on those lists, you may have already guessed it, publications like the NYT s who have been losing huge amounts of ad revenues to alternative news sources that are eating their lunches, will be able to re-pocket those profits once they regain their monopoly on the news.",0

"At around 12:40 am on Saturday, July 9, two Houston, Texas police officers shot and killed Alva Braziel.Immediately after the shooting, police released a series of statements in an attempt to show that the shooting was  justified. As KHOU reports here:Houston Police Department spokeswoman Jodi Silva said the two officers were on routine patrol just before 1 a.m. when they spotted the man, holding a gun.Silva said when police approached him, the man was pointing the gun straight up in the air. She said they ordered him to drop it. She said a bystander did, too. Who is speaking with the suspect, telling him,  Put the weapon down. Put the weapon down,'  Silva said.Instead, officers said, the man pointed his gun at them.Watch the video below, courtesy of KHOU:Newly released video from a gas station near the scene of the officer-involved shooting appears to show Braziel with his hands in the air at the time he was shot.At the beginning of the video, Braziel can be seen walking up the street toward the gas station where the security footage was captured. He does not appear to be waving a gun or behaving erratically.At the 27-second mark, the first police car arrives on the scene. According to police they were just driving by and saw Braziel waving a gun around in the street. The video does not support this statement.It shows Braziel raising his hands in the air the minute he sees police coming.Eleven seconds after the first police car pulls up, Braziel falls to the ground, his body struck by ten bullets.Watch the security footage below, courtesy of Kory Watkins on YouTube:Police also claim that a bystander was trying to convince Braziel to put the gun down. The video also casts doubt on this statement.One unidentified witness to the shooting, who posted this video to YouTube, states that Braziel didn t do nothing. She states: They just rolled up on him. They said the man was shooting in the air and the police just came up and started shooting. They just shot at somebody, whoever was walking, they just shot him. Watch the video below:According to Houston police, both officers involved in the shooting were wearing body cameras. The police department has not yet released the footage from the officer s cameras.The two officers who pumped ten bullets into Alva Braziel have been placed on leave pending an internal investigation.Image credit: video screen capture KHOU",0
"CAIR knows what it s doing in Tulsa, OK but as usual pretends it s no big deal. We ve dealt with the CAIR, Michigan leader who s been on Twitter, along with others in the organization, bashing our military. We took screen shots of the Tweets that are included in this article. The organization is trying to taunt our veterans on a day when we should be saluting them. If you live in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area, please go and protest this float.The Islamic hate group CAIR is taunting our veterans and military personnel with this latest stunt. Yesterday, veterans gathered at the Richard L. Jones, Jr. Airport to protest the terror-tied float. The group is asking parade goers to literally turn their backs on the float for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.The U.S. front group for a UAE-designated Islamic terrorist group will have a float in one of the largest Veterans Day parades in the country.The subversive organization known as the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, continues to try to burnish its unsavory image and obscure knowledge of its true nature.Adam Soltani, executive director of CAIR Oklahoma, insists that his organization is pure as the driven snow:  Any claim that CAIR is associated with the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, or any other terrorist organization is absolutely preposterous. CAIR was founded in 1994 in Washington, D.C., as a national organization to be a civil rights advocate for American Muslims, to stand up for constitutional rights, for religious freedom, for pluralism, and for every right that we value as American citizens. A Memorial Day Tweet From CAIR, Michigan Director And Retweeted by the San Francisco CAIR Director:Soltani s words are far from the truth. The reality is that  CAIR is an unindicted co-conspirator in a Hamas terror funding case   so named by the Justice Department. CAIR operatives have repeatedly refusedtodenounce Hamas and Hizballah as terrorist groups. Several former CAIR officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror. CAIR s cofounder and longtime Board chairman (Omar Ahmad), as well as its chief spokesman (Ibrahim Hooper), have made Islamic supremacist statements. Its California chapter distributed a poster telling Muslims not to talk to the FBI. CAIR has opposed every anti-terror measure that has ever been proposed or implemented. According to a captured internal document entered into evidence in the largest terrorist funding trial in our nation s history, the Islamic Association of Palestine, which is the parent organization of Hamas-tied CAIR, was a Muslim Brotherhood entity, working toward  eliminating and destroying Western civilization from within, and sabotaging its miserable house   CAIR operatives attack and dismantle America s greatest freedoms through litigation jihad. They smear and destroy the voices of freedom via their well-paid hacks in the media. Over the past decades, they have expended untold amounts of money to buy influence among media and elected officials.Michigan Director of CAIR: A Muslim nation with ties to 9/11 (Qatar) made a major endowment to the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The Saudis have funded them with at least $50 million.

"Vietnam has supposedly made modest gains in reducing human rights abuses BUT a Catholic priest was just released after TWO DECADES in a Vietnam prison. What on earth did this priest do? Well, he fought for religious freedom Yes, Vietnam is still holding others in situations just like this. Soooo Vietnam throws us a bone and releases just one prisoner as a gesture so Obama will lift the arms ban? WHY NOT HOLD OUT FOR ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS?Vietnam has freed one of its longest-serving political prisoners, just a few days before a visit by Barack Obama in which human rights is expected to be a key talking point.Nguyen Van Ly, a Catholic priest who has spent most of the past two decades in detention due to his relentless pursuit of democracy and religious freedom, was released from a prison in central Hue province after his fourth stint behind bars. They released him in a special amnesty by Vietnam s president before the Obama trip,  Catholic priest Phan Van Loi told Reuters by phone.The communist country s state-controlled media has made no mention of Ly s release, which comes as Obama weighs whether to lift an arms embargo on Vietnam, a decision Washington has long said would hinge on human rights progress.Loi said that he met Ly after his release and that although he appeared weak, he was in high spirits.The US embassy in Hanoi welcomed the release of Ly but said other dissidents should be freed too. We call on the government to release unconditionally all prisoners of conscience and allow all Vietnamese to express their political views peacefully without fear of retribution,  an embassy spokesman said.During Ly s long periods of incarceration, sometimes in solitary confinement, he suffered numerous health problems, including strokes and partial paralysis.Ly s release on Friday was three months before the end of an eight-year prison sentence for  anti-state propaganda , which comes under a section of the criminal code that rights groups say is vaguely worded and used to punish outspoken critics.The priest has been on the receiving end of some of the country s harshest verdicts, stemming from his opposition to the political monopoly of the Communist party. He set up a pro-democracy movement and was behind several banned publications.Human rights is a thorny issue for Vietnam that has created dilemmas for western governments keen to engage with one of Asia s fastest-growing economies but alarmed by the arrests, harassment and jailing of its detractors.Via: The Guardian",0

"Donald Trump should be coming to the realization that his Muslim ban may have been just a step too far. But in case he needs help figuring it out, Democrats are ready to help teach him a lesson.According to Politico, high-ranking lawmakers on numerous committees sent a letter to DHS Secretary John Kelly on Sunday night. They demanded that he hold an  emergency  meeting to discuss Trump s unlawful executive order banning Muslims from entering the United States. As ranking members of the committees of jurisdiction for matters of immigration, border security, and admission of refugees, we write to you on an emergency basis to request a meeting to discuss the implementation and guidance concerning the Executive Order,  the congressmen wrote.The letter was reportedly signed by  House Judiciary Committee ranking member John Conyers (D-Mich.), Homeland Security ranking member Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), top Democrat on Judiciary s immigration panel. In their letter, the lawmakers pointed out that  only two days after the Order was signed, it is clear that it has already led to panic and disorder, not to mention protests. Lofgren intends to introduce legislation this week in an effort to fight Trump s bigoted ban. Unfortunately, Paul Ryan being the fickle fellow that he is, is now supporting Trump s order even though he denounced the idea of  religious tests  just six months ago. This means Logren s move will probably end up dead in the water.Democrats are asking Kelly to sit down with them no later than Wednesday. In addition, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have both reached out to Kelly on their own.In the letter, the lawmakers also blasted DHS for accusations that customs officials have been denying legal counsel to detainees. Given the widespread chaos and confusion caused by the order   and the issuance of stays last evening concerning the Order by federal courts in New York, Virginia, and Massachusetts,  they wrote,  it is vital that we meet as soon as possible so that we may provide needed guidance and information to our committees and our constituents. House and Senate Democrats also intend to stage a protest in front of the Supreme Court at 6 p.m. on Monday night. The fight is only just beginning but Democrats intend to battle Trump s bigotry every step of the way. Some Dems have even said that they are  exploring all legal options, including an Amicus Brief in support of the ACLU. The letter concluded with the lawmakers telling Kelly that they  look forward to meeting with you in short order so that we can have an open and candid discussion about how the Trump administration arrived at this chaotic place, what you understand the meaning of the Executive Order to be, and what guidance you have offered to your employees and other stakeholders.

"KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan capital Kabul braced on Saturday for further possible attacks ahead of Ashura, the holiest day on the Shi ite Muslim calendar, a day after an attack claimed by Islamic State that killed at least five people near a large Shi ite mosque. Ahead of the celebration on Sunday, signs of increased security were in evidence across Kabul, with extra police checkpoints and roadblocks in many areas, while security was also increased in other cities. Afghanistan, a majority Sunni Muslim country, has traditionally not suffered the sectarian violence that has devastated countries like Iraq, but a series of attacks over recent years have targeted the Shi ite community.  We are concerned about this. We had internal fighting in the past but never religious fighting,  said Arif Rahmani, a member of parliament and a member of the mainly Shi ite Hazara community that has been particularly targeted. The government has provided some basic training and weapons for a few hundred volunteer guards near mosques and other meeting places but many fear that the protection, which covers only some of the city s more than 400 Shi ite mosques, is insufficient. In 2011, more than 80 people were killed in Ashura attacks in Kabul and the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and there have been a string of others since, with 20 people killed in a suicide attack on a mosque in Kabul a month ago. Friday s attack, by suicide bombers posing as shepherds walking their sheep along a road outside the Hussainya mosque in the Qala-e-Fatehullah area of the city, did not reach the mosque itself but wounded 20 people in addition to the five killed. No up-to-date census data exists for Afghanistan but different estimates put the size of the Shi ite community at between 10-20 percent of the population, mostly Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras. Ashura, on the 10th day of the month of Muharram, celebrates the martyrdom of Hussein, one of the grandsons of the Prophet Mohammad, and is marked by large public commemorations by Shi ite Muslims. President Ashraf Ghani condemned Friday s attack and said it would not break the unity between religions in Afghanistan. But at a time when rivalry between the patchwork of different ethnic groups in the country has increasingly come into the open, Rahmani said the evident objective of the attacks was to ratchet up the tensions to create instability.  In the past, there were warnings that there were groups that wanted to stir ethnic and religious conflict among Afghans but now it is reality,  Rahmani said.  There are people who want to create disunity among ethnic and religious groups,  he said. ",1
"This week, Donald Trump disappointed the entire world by pulling out of the Paris climate deal. It was a decision that was condemned by several world leaders, and marked yet another way that Trump had ruined America s standing as a global leader. To celebrate his horrible decision, Trump organized a  Pittsburgh not Paris  rally to celebrate America s exit from the deal. There was just one major problem   Trump blew it off.The Trump campaign had hyped up this event so much, and even organized it to be located right across the street from the White House   put Donnie wasn t there. He bailed, and decided to play golf instead. So much for being a dedicated POTUS and showing his dwindling number of supporters that he appreciates them, as his approval ratings continue to plummet to historic lows.The White House Press Pool told PoliticusUSA: After an uneventful ride along highways and byways toward Sterling, Virginia, motorcade pulled up to the Trump National Golf Club at 10:42 a.m.Motorcade split off and pool is now holding in a spectacular clubhouse overlooking indoor tennis courts. If any of Trump s supporters still think Trump cared about and appreciated them, this is a pretty rude awakening. When Trump s campaign announced the rally, it certainly sounded like Trump would actually be present. However, the event invitation was a little more cryptic. It said: As you know, the President has been under siege from the mainstream media and the Democrats, especially now that he put American jobs first by withdrawing from the Paris Accord. Therefore, we are organizing a group to demonstrate our support for President Trump and his fearless leadership. Either way, these Trump supporters expected Trump to be there, and he wasn t because he was playing golf   his main hobby when he wants to avoid doing his job. Trump must know that his presidency is doomed, because blowing off a rally full of supporters when his popularity is suffering is a bold move. To make matters worse, this rally couldn t have been more convenient   it was just across the street! And yet, Trump couldn t be bothered.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",0
"While many in the United States have come to the logical decision that Donald Trump is stark raving mad, there are still those who apparently have made him their choice for president. One of those people was just in the audience for a taping of ABC s The View and was questioned by host Joy Behar after the show.When the woman who supports Trump (yes, woman) is asked why, she refuses to say why   which if I may add is very Trumpian, because Trump always makes claims with nothing to back it up either   he then explains that she voted for President Obama, but said that it was the biggest mistake of her life. Then she said she works in a hospital and hates Obamacare, even though moments later she said she s been unemployed for a year. She somehow thinks that Trump would actually be better for healthcare and the unemployed. When asked if maybe she should support Bernie Sanders, who wants to provided single payer and a better safety net, she adamantly refused.Now, not to speak ill of a woman who clearly doesn t understand how the parties operate and who stands for what, but it seems she wants to go back to a system that will harm her more than help her. And I think a lot of the blame for her misunderstanding comes down to misinformation and even lack of information being spread by not only candidates, but the media.This woman wants change. Sure. That s great. However, what she wants she s not going to find in Trump.Watch the back and forth here: Watch what happens when @JoyVBehar questions an audience member s support for Donald Trump: https://t.co/kQ9dGmHJ1O  The View (@TheView) May 12, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",0
"On October 20, 2015, radical Muslim State senator Jamilah Rasheed was arrested while protesting with the manufactured  hands up don t shoot  movement in Ferguson. The vocal anti-gun legislator was also drunk and in possession of you guessed it a gun!You probably don t remember her arrest, or maybe you never even knew she was arrested. The media s kinda funny when it comes to covering law-breaking Democrats. So in case you missed it, the woman on her knees with her  hands up  pushing a false narrative that was proven in court to be a lie has decided to join Colin Kaepernick in his public disdain for America.In what she calls a  show of solidarity  with Colin Kaepernick, Missouri State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, chose to sit as her colleagues stood for the Pledge of Allegiance on the senate floor. Nasheed said that she wants to call attention to the issues that the 49ers player outlines and that she is not  anti-American. Her seat taking was met with complete silence in the chamber.When the session ended however, Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a former GOP candidate for governor who presided over the Senate Wednesday, released a statement calling Nasheed s protest an  occasion for great sorrow.  He said he worried about  the example she is setting, particularly for our young people. It is indeed a sad day in this country when out NFL players, Soccer players, and now even members of our government are choosing to address their own beliefs and real issues in our country by completely disrespecting parts of what make us what we are AND they are doing it on the clock as we, the American people, are paying for it.How can it even be considered ethical for such protest to be acted out while on the job? I fully agree that each of these people do in fact have the right to protest how they see fit, but the issue here is that they are using platforms to get the attention they want that are literally funded by the very citizenship that they are showing such a huge disrespect for.Use your free time to protest, not the time in which I as an American citizen am paying for.H/T [ Fox ]",0

However, there is one veteran Republican who is still staunchly #NeverTrump  longtime GOP consultant Rick Wilson.Wilson took to his twitter account to slam his own party s leadership over their endorsement of Trump, and it was absolutely glorious. He even gave Trump a new name    Cheeto Jesus    and ripped his colleagues a new one in the best way possible.1/ How the actual fuck does anyone at the RNC have standing to act shocked that Trump is not doing the basics of campaigning?

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Monday that if elected, she would pressure U.S. technology companies to help intelligence agencies disrupt violent plots after a gunman inspired by radical Islamist groups killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub. In a speech in Cleveland, she articulated plans for expanded online surveillance of potential extremist attackers. She is campaigning against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of the November presidential election.  “We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out,” Clinton said. “That’s why I’ve proposed an ‘intelligence surge’ to bolster our capabilities across the board, with appropriate safeguards here at home.” While Clinton did not detail what her effort would entail, she said she wants technology companies to be more cooperative to government requests for help in countering online propaganda, tracking patterns in social media and intercepting communications. Clinton’s comments will likely further stoke an international debate over digital privacy, which has flared  after attacks in Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, California. Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old Orlando shooter and a U.S. citizen, was likely inspired by jihadist content online, but there is not yet evidence that he was part of any plot directed by others outside the United States, FBI Director James Comey said Monday. Facebook (FB.O), Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) have all dedicated more resources to combating online propaganda and recruiting by Islamic militants within the past year. But they do so quietly to avoid the perception that they are overly cozy with authorities. The companies rely heavily on users to flag problematic content, which is impossible to eliminate completely without creating a highly censored Internet, according to technologists.  Counterterrorism experts have also long said so-called lone wolf attackers are difficult to track and stop because they often do not communicate their plans to others. Twitter and Facebook had no immediate response to questions about Clinton’s comments. Google declined comment. The Center for Democracy and Technology and Electronic Frontier Foundation, both digital advocacy groups, said they were waiting for more specifics from Clinton before commenting. Unlike Trump, Clinton did not call for blocking online content. She did not reiterate her previous push for a massive effort to break encryption, and she ruled out targeted surveillance of Muslim Americans as “dangerous.” ",1
"If you haven t heard about the ongoing battle between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren then you re clearly living under a rock, or possibly a newborn baby. They ve been going back and forth on Twitter, in speeches, and every time he tries to call her  goofy  or  Pocahontas  (because he s apparently five years old) she smacks him down harder and harder.During her commencement address at Suffolk University this past weekend, Warren went after him yet again.Taking a brilliant dig, because let s face it, she s brilliant, Warren said: How s this speech polling so far? Higher or lower than Donald Trump s unfavorable numbers with women? If you weren t aware, Trump isn t doing so well with women, polling at 70% unfavorable. But can we be all that surprised? He s very misogynistic, constantly calling women names, and him going after Warren and then Hillary Clinton for actually being a woman, is just another example of that.Something tells me Warren isn t about to let up any time soon. Trump can try his name-calling games, but when it comes to strong women who have had to fight twice as hard to get half as much recognition their whole lives, he s in for a big surprise. Those games may work on weak Republican men, but just you wait. Just. You. Wait.Watch her whole speech here:Featured image via video screen capture",0
"PARIS (Reuters) - President Francois Hollande on Thursday fired back at comments by U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that “France was no longer France” after a slew of militant attacks, saying France would always stay true to its values. France is reeling from two strikes in under two weeks by attackers who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, the first when a Tunisian plowed his truck through a crowd in Nice, the second when two men slit the throat of a priest. “France is no longer France. They won’t like me for saying that,” Trump told reporters in Miami on Wednesday. “And this world better be very careful and the better get very tough and they’ll never do it with (Democratic nominee) Hillary Clinton.” Trump’s campaign has been marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric. He has called for tougher surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were “trying to take over our children.” Trump has rejected the criticism that his rhetoric is racist. Brushing off Trump’s words, Hollande on Thursday told reporters France would always remain true to its values and ideals. “When you stoop low you’re not true to yourself anymore, that’s something that can happen to others on the other side of the Atlantic,” Hollande said, without directly mentioning Trump.

"This new information just adds more validity Trump s argument, that the US needs to take a more serious look at the way we vet immigrants if we want to protect our national security While State Department and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service branch of the Department of Homeland Security do ask if immigrants have been involved in terrorism, the most well known of over a dozen terrorist groups aren t listed in applications, according to the analysis from homeland security expert Mark A. Sauter.The form asks if the applicant has ever belonged to a terrorist group, but neglects to ask if they currently belong to one. How hard would that be to update? He said that federal officials told him that the questions about terror group involvement are required by federal law, meaning that congressional action is needed to include modern-day threats in the written questions.However, detailed written questions are asked about Nazi cooperation, as are questions about whether applicants are drunks, polygamists, or Communists. One survey does single out Colombian terror organizations in the written questions, though they have never attacked inside the U.S. The lack of specific questioning about the biggest threat to the United States as the country eyes thousands in line from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran and elsewhere seeking residency raises new questions about how immigrants are vetted, and gives ammunition to Republicans like presidential candidate Donald Trump who has called for  extreme vetting  to weed out likely terrorists.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will not seek to repeal Obamacare taxes as a part of expected tax reform legislation, the top House Republican on tax policy said on Monday. “We never envisioned bringing Obamacare taxes into that (reform) effort and I still don’t,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters.  Obamacare taxes “go away when we repeal and replace. And so regrettably, they stay in place,” Brady said.  ",1
"Senators are increasingly pissed off about the group of Republicans who are writing a healthcare bill in secret. They re supposed to vote on it very soon, Mitch McConnell is refusing to allow more than 10 hours of debate time to each party, and they don t like the idea of being forced to vote on something they haven t even seen. Sen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine, made a point of hunting for the bill right before launching into a speech about Medicaid.Right as he was recognized, he apologized and asked for a moment because he was still looking for the healthcare bill. The show he makes of doing that is perfect in light of the secrecy in which McConnell and his cohorts are busy working. Watch below:!! Angus King:  I m looking for the health care bill. I know it s here somewhere  pic.twitter.com/Cod92hySDP  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 21, 2017Other Senators are slamming McConnell et al in their own ways, too. Republican Pete King, of New York, threw a livid fit about it during a radio interview. He said that private meetings do have to happen, but there needs to be more public debate and he thinks it looks like they re trying to hide something. He said it s too secretive, which will put  a cloud over the whole final product. John McCain, another Republican, told Bloomberg that he hasn t yet seen the bill either. He also hasn t  met any American that has,  but he s sure the Russians hacked in and got most of it.And while most people aren t exactly thrilled with Cory Booker right now, he and a couple of his fellow Senators left the Senate building and tried hunting it down, including going over to the Congressional Budget Office to see if there was a copy there they could see.In other words, the GOP is really angering pretty much everyone with this. It s especially hypocritical given that many who are in favor of this kind of secrecy were angry about the ACA allegedly being written and passed in secret (it wasn t).Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0

"From the very outset of Trump s improbable political career one thing has been abundantly clear: His contempt for the American soldier borders on pathological.While he occasionally gets goaded into praising the troops (with all the enthusiasm of a hostage held at gunpoint), the Republican nominee, who deferred his own military service in Vietnam a number of times, more often than not shows nothing but outright disgust for them. He famously accused John McCain of being a loser because he was captured and tortured by the North Vietnamese (while Trump was sitting out the war). He more recently used the military to avoid partaking in an uncomfortable primary debate and then refused to give veterans the money he raised until he was exposed.And now, in a moment that is sure to be Hillary Clinton s very next campaign ad, Trump accused unnamed Iraq War veterans of stealing millions of dollars from the U.S. government that was meant to help rebuild the war-torn country. If it s not immediately obvious, that would be a massive crime. Trump tossed around the accusation almost casually.Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, ladies and gentlemen: Iraq, crooked as hell. How about bringing baskets of money? Millions and millions of dollars and handing it out? I want to know, who were the soldiers who had that job? Because I think they re living very well right now. Trump, as could be expected, offers absolutely zero proof that this took place. Another conspiracy to add to his vault full of them.In fact, the soldiers who returned home from Iraq are not doing  very well right now.  Having served their country in a war without a clear objective, they got back to discover that the Republicans who sent them there now had no interest in helping them. Struggling with war injuries both physical and psychological, high rates of suicide and devastating unemployment, the veterans of the most wealthy nation on earth were kicked to the curb.In 2014, Senate Republicans unilaterally killed a  sweeping $21 billion bill  that would have  expanded medical, educational and other benefits  for these troops. Their reasoning? It s an  entitlement  that we cannot afford.Republicans have charged the bill was too expensive and disputed the way it would be paid for with overseas contingency operations funds used to fund the war in Afghanistan. And that, Republicans argued, wouldn t amount to real savings, since the money wouldn t have been spent anyway with the war winding down by year s end.If there were baskets of money sent to Iraq. It certainly doesn t seem like the troops who served there came home with any.Kudos to Donald Trump. In a week where one might have assumed accusing the President of the United States of helping ISIS was the lowest thing he could do, he managed to dig a little deeper. It s a wonder he has any supporters left.UPDATE: As expected, Donald Trump s campaign has rushed to do damage control. Spokesperson Hope Hicks claimed Trump was referring to Iraqi soldiers, not American ones. A blatant lie given the exact quote (go back and re-read it), but undermined even further by the fact that, as Charles Johnson of Little Green Footballs noted, Trump has previously made a similar claim about American soldiers stealing money (as far back as 2015).He also suggested that some American soldiers charged with distributing money to fund the Afghan and Iraqi government embezzled it instead.  I want to know who are the soldiers carrying suitcases with $50m?  asked Trump.  How stupid are we? I wouldn t be surprised if those soldiers, if the cash didn t get there. Trump doesn t even have the guts to stand by what he said. Sad!Featured image via Darren McCollester/Getty Images",0
"THE USDA, EPA AND NOW THE DOJ Obama is using billions of taxpayer dollars to redistribute to his cronies and liberal agitators. Just Tuesday, the DOJ s Loretta Lynch unleashed millions to be given to  community organizers  to do who knows what with The Justice Department announced $163 million in grants to be distributed for the purpose of  building trust with the community.  As part of its effort to execute the recommendations of the president s task force, the Justice Department is looking for 10 localities to participate in a  collaborative reform  process to serve as a model for the rest of the country, emphasizing  procedural justice  and  implicit bias training. A list of grants awarded by the Justice Department in 2013 indicate federal funding has been and will continue to be directed toward activist groups described by critics as  racial agitators. For example,  Community Policing Development Awards  were given in 2013 to programs including  Building Trust With Communities of Color  from the Vera Institute of Justice, the  Race and Social Justice Initiative  at the Portland Police Department and  Racial Reconciliation, Truth-Telling, and Police Legitimacy  at John Jay College.Matthew Vadum, an expert in left-wing activist groups and the author of  Subversion, Inc.,  warns such federal funding invariably finds its way into the hands of progressive activists who personally profit from increased community tensions. After attacking police as stupid, racist, vicious and thuggish almost non-stop throughout his presidency, now he suddenly cares about police officers and the communities they serve. Now he wants to throw millions of taxpayer dollars at ACORN-like groups and professional left-wing agitators whose calling in life is to generate civil unrest,  he said. This means that people like the president s point man on race relations, riot organizer Al Sharpton, will get his hands on lots of government money. This money won t actually help anyone except for the often-violent Saul Alinsky-inspired community organizers who have been living high off the hog ever since one of their own took up residence in the White House.

Under President Obama the country s food-stamp program rebranded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to eliminate stigma associated with the welfare benefit has grown immensely, according to the government s own figures. A record number of people, around 47 million, get free groceries from Uncle Sam at an astounding cost of about $80 billion a year.It isn t enough to give tens of millions of people free food. The administration wants to assure the welfare recipients are eating healthy and nutritious items by providing government-subsidized produce, whole grains and low-fat milk in neighborhoods it has labeled  food deserts.  It s part of a broader effort spearheaded by Michelle Obama s $4.5 billion law to revolutionize the inner city diet by providing fruits, veggies and grilled lean meats as alternatives to greasy, fried foods that tend to be more popular in those areas presumably because they re cheaper.The money flows through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which has poured huge sums into the cause and this month dedicated the additional $31.5 million.  Encouraging low income families to put more healthy food in their grocery baskets is part of USDA s ongoing commitment to improving the diet and health of all Americans,  said Obama s Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. He referred to the costly program as  creative community partnerships  that will ultimately help SNAP participants better afford fruits and vegetables. Officially the funds for this particular initiative have been coined Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grants.Judicial Watch has reported on this extensively in the last few years, exposing the enormous sums of taxpayer dollars that have been wasted on this ineffective experiment. In fact, last year JW wrote about an academic study that shows the First Lady s pricey initiative to eliminate  food deserts  is failing miserably. The study focused on a low-income neighborhood in Philadelphia that received generous grants from the government to build new markets and add healthy food options to convenience stores. Researchers found that dietary habits or obesity were not altered and it did not lead to changes in fruit and vegetable intake or body mass index.Before that JW reported that the administration wasted $75 million to study ways of better recognizing the nutritional needs of low-income communities and more than $100 million in Obamacare grants to  reduce health disparities  between minorities and whites by, among other things, eliminating food deserts. The administration even created a special internet mapping tool (Food Desert Locator) that identifies areas with  limited access to affordable and nutritious foods. Less than a year ago the Obama administration announced that it was launching a special research center that will find ways to help food-stamp recipients make healthier and wiser food choices. It will be called the Center for Behavioral Economics and Healthy Food Choice and Americans will pay at least $1.9 million possibly more to create it. There seems to be no end to the madness, an obsession to control what private citizens consume and change the ingrained eating habits of an entire demographic.Read more: Judicial WatchEPA GRANTS AND FUNDS USED TO REDISTRIBUTE TAXDOLLARS AND BUY SUPPORT FOR PHONY AGENDASBut the American Lung Association backs up the White House and EPA claims   vigorously promoting the phony pollution/asthma link.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. lawmaker who was President Donald Trump’s pick for drug czar withdrew on Tuesday after a report he spearheaded a bill that hurt the government’s ability to crack down on opioid makers flooding the market with the addictive painkillers. Trump had pegged Representative Tom Marino, a Republican from Pennsylvania, to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy, as the administration faces an epidemic of opioid overdoses that is killing tens of thousands of Americans annually. The position required Senate confirmation. Trump wrote on Twitter: “Rep. Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar. Tom is a fine man and a great Congressman!” Marino worked as a federal prosecutor under Republican former President George W. Bush, was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 and served on Trump’s transition team after the Republican president was elected last November. Marino said in a statement he had decided to “remove the distraction my nomination has created to the utterly vital mission of this premier agency.” He defended his role in helping pass the bill that was criticized for weakening attempts to rein in opioid use. He said the legislation would help create “a balanced solution for ensuring those who genuinely needed access to certain medications were able to do so, while also empowering the Drug Enforcement Agency  to enforce the law and prevent the sale and abuse of prescription drugs.” Marino said he had been the target of “unfair reporting” and false allegations by a former DEA employee, who he did not name. The Washington Post and the CBS program “60 Minutes” published an investigation on Sunday that showed Marino had worked to weaken federal efforts to slow the flow of opioid drugs. The legislation championed by Marino, which was passed by Congress and signed into law last year by Democratic President Barack Obama, was the product of a drug industry quest to weaken the DEA’s authority to stem the flow of painkillers to the black market, according to the report. The law made it almost impossible for the DEA to freeze suspicious narcotics shipments, according to government documents cited by the Post. Trump has been criticized for his response to the opioid epidemic. He has yet to declare it a national emergency as he pledged to do on Aug. 10 following a recommendation by a presidential commission.  Asked about that at a news conference on Monday, Trump said he would make the declaration next week. Such a move would boost funding for various forms of treatment and give the government more flexibility in taking steps to expedite action. Nine months into his presidency, Trump has not named a chief for the Drug Enforcement Administration, currently headed by an acting administrator. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were responsible for more than 33,000 U.S. deaths in 2015, the latest year for which data is available. Estimates show the death rate has continued rising. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Marino’s withdrawal “the right decision,” but added that “the fact that he was nominated in the first place is further evidence that when it comes to the opioid crisis, the Trump administration talks the talk, but refuses to walk the walk.”  No. 2 U.S. Justice Department official Rod Rosenstein, asked about the Marino-backed law during a news conference announcing indictments against accused Chinese fentanyl traffickers, said the Trump administration would review the law.  Rosenstein said he was “not prepared to answer” whether the administration would ask Congress to repeal it. “We are going to look into these issues ... about what tools DEA has available to it. And if we conclude they don’t have the appropriate tools, then we will seek more tools,” Rosenstein said. The Justice Department announced the indictments of two major Chinese drug traffickers on charges of illegally making and selling fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid painkiller, over the internet to Americans. The department said it charged Xiaobing Yan, 40, and Jian Zhang, 38, with conspiring to distribute large quantities of fentanyl and chemically similar drugs. It said Zhang’s actions led to four deaths. Trump’s opioid commission, headed by Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, cited government data showing that since 1999 U.S. opioid overdoses have quadrupled, adding that nearly two-thirds of U.S. drug overdoses were linked to opioids such as heroin and the powerful painkillers Percocet, OxyContin and fentanyl.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty moderate Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives warned on Friday that efforts to overhaul the federal tax code could be jeopardized by demands for including major spending cuts in a fiscal 2018 budget resolution. In a June 30 letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, lawmakers from the moderate Tuesday Group said that including hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to mandatory programs could be “extremely problematic” for tax reform and asked for a budget delay until Senate Republicans finish their debate on healthcare legislation. “We fear that if the House persists on pursuing this course, it could imperil tax reform,” wrote the lawmakers, who were led by Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. Republicans must pass a 2018 budget resolution to unlock a key legislative tool known as reconciliation, which the party needs to move a tax bill forward without support from Democrats.  But members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus say they will back a spending plan only if it cuts mandatory programs including Medicaid and food stamps, reductions that moderates oppose. “House Republicans have made significant progress on budget decisions and these family discussions will continue amongst the conference,” Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement. The Freedom Caucus and Tuesday Group each represents enough House Republicans to stymie legislation on its own.  Outside organizations including powerful business lobby groups are increasingly worried that the disagreement could lead to a political stand-off that prevents tax reform from occurring. “No other reforms under consideration rise to the importance of pro-growth, comprehensive tax reform,” the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Business said in a joint letter to Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday. Republican moderates also worry that adding mandatory cuts to a reconciliation bill would create unpalatable legislation that reduces benefits for the poor while granting tax cuts to corporations and wealthy individuals, according to aides.  The House Budget Committee canceled plans to send a resolution for fiscal 2018 to the floor this week, after the chairmen of several other committees rejected efforts to wring $250 billion in mandatory spending from spending. Freedom Caucus members want much larger cuts.  ",1
"WOW! The truth hurts! John McCain becomes a total ass when asked by Fox reporter Peter Doocy if his votes are a protest of President Trump:IN CASE TYOU DIDN T CATCH THAT: Senator John McCain:  Why would you say something that stupid? Why would you ask something that dumb? Huh? My job as a United States senator as a senator from Arizona which I was just reelected to. You think that I would somehow behave in a way that I would block everything just because of some personal disagreement? That s a dumb question. Doocy s question really isn t too far off. We could begin with McCain s shocking vote for keeping Obamacare. Since then, the war of words between President Trump and McCain has only gotten more heated.OUR LATEST ON THE FEUD BETWEEN THE SENATOR AND THE PRESIDENT:President Trump hit back at Senator John McCain in a pointed statement that should make it clear that Trump isn t playing around with globalist RINO McCain anymore. You can t blame Trump because McCain just keeps nipping at his heels with swipes trying to undermine Trump s policies. RINO McCain famously demolished the latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare in a dramatic show during the vote. McCain came onto the floor at the end of the Senate vote and voted no with a dramatic thumbs down motion.McCain has been at odds with Trump since Trump questioned McCains status as a war hero. It seems McCain has had it out for Trump ever since.Another bombshell on the McCain/Trump feud hypothesizes that the Trump Dossier could have come from McCain.The latest slam to Trump happened just last night  during a speech McCain gave. McCain called out Trump s nationalism but it didn t take long for Trump to respond:President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued a warning shot after Republican Sen. John McCain questioned  half-baked, spurious nationalism  in America s foreign policy.Trump said in a radio interview with WMAL in Washington that  people have to be careful because at some point I fight back.  The president added  I m being very, very nice but at some point I fight back and it won t be pretty. MANY QUESTIONS RAISED ON MCCAIN S STORY OF CAPTIVITYTrump could be referring to new questions about McCain s captivity in Vietnam. McCain has always been touted as a war hero for decades but many of the men who served when he did have raised questions about McCain.McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent 5  years in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp and is battling brain cancer, offered a simple response to Trump:  I have faced tougher adversaries. In Philadelphia on Monday night, the six-term Republican senator from Arizona received an award for a lifetime of service and sacrifice to the country. In addition to recalling his more than two decades of military service and his imprisonment during the war, McCain took a moment to go a step further than the night s other speakers, who lamented what many described as a fractured political climate.MCCAIN S GLOBALIST WORD SALAD: To abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems,  he said,  is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history. He continued:  We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. Former Vice President Joe Biden presented McCain with the Liberty Medal. Though members of opposing parties, the two men worked together during their time in the Senate. Former President Barack Obama, who defeated McCain in his bid for the presidency in 2008, congratulated the senator on the award in a tweet Monday night. I m grateful to @SenJohnMcCain for his lifetime of service to our country.

"I guess we re not the only ones who are 100% FED UP with our marxist president Following the influx of illegal immigrant minors from Central America, an official at the federal agency charged with protecting public health describes Barack Obama as  the worst pres we have ever had,  an  amateur  and  Marxist,  according to internal emails obtained by Judicial Watch.JW got the records as part of an investigation into the Center for Disease Control s (CDC) activation of an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to deal with the barrage of illegal alien minors last summer. Tens of thousands of Central Americans came into the United States through the Mexican border and contagious diseases many considered to be eradicated in the U.S. became a tremendous concern. The CDC, which operates under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), responded by opening an emergency facility designed to monitor and coordinate response activities to eminent public health threats. This special emergency division was created after the 2001 terrorist attacks and has responded to more than 50 public health threats, including hurricanes, food borne disease outbreaks, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the Haiti cholera outbreak. Scientists from across the CDC are brought together to analyze, validate, and efficiently exchange information during a public health emergency and connect with response partners. The EOC also coordinates the deployment of CDC staff and the procurement and management of all equipment and supplies that agency responders may need during their deployment.[ ]It s a major and costly operation that can stick American taxpayers with a huge tab. That s why JW launched a probe when the Obama administration took in the illegal immigrants, initially coined Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC), with open arms last summer. JW has sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for planning records involving the border crisis as well as information relating to the solicitation of  on-demand escort services  for the 65,000 UACs that remain in the U.S. Last year JW also reported that the illegal immigrant minors have brought in serious diseases, including swine flu, dengue fever, possibly Ebola virus and tuberculosis.The CDC records obtained by JW this week include email exchanges between agency officials directly involved in the activation of the EOC to handle the health threats created by the influx of illegal alien minors last summer. In an email dated June 9, 2014, CDC Logistics Management Specialist George Roark wrote to CDC Public Health Advisor William Adams that  no country in the world would allow  the influx. Adams replies that  in ten years or less, they ll all be voting Commander s intent  Roark fires back by describing Obama as  the worst pres we have ever had he truly is  the amateur  but a Marxist too.

"The leftist teachers and the press are part of the HUGE problem of misinformation about Donald Trump. They are partly to blame for the violence and hate out there. Here s a perfect example: A self-described mentor for the girl who attacked Jade urged compassion for the suspended student.  We don t want a mistake during a highly emotional and intense time to affect her long-term future,  said Khabral Muhammad, a life coach at Live in Peace, a nonprofit group supporting East Palo Alto youth. WOODSIDE, Calif.   One Peninsula high school student s support of Donald Trump may have made her a target.The Woodside High School student and her family are shocked something like this could happen. The girl said all of her friends were posting about the election last night, but her post got her beat up.Cellphone video captured the moment a female student attacked sophomore Jade Armenio. This girl comes up to me and she said,  Do you hate Mexicans?  and I was like,  no,  and she said,  You support Trump. You hate Mexicans.' Armenio says the girl hit her, threw her to the ground, pulled out her earrings and hair. She was left with a bloody nose and scratches and bruises. Before the results came in on election night, Armenio had posted on Instagram that she hoped Trump would win. I don t think I could name one person on any of my accounts who didn t say their opinion last night,  Armenio said.Armenio s parents say they re mortified about what happened. My husband and I don t put our political views on social media. Kids still do it. That s their life. We tell them don t do it, but even if she does she should never be hit like that,  said Gina Armenio.The principle of Woodside High School issued a statement that reads in part the recorded incident was investigated in conjunction with law enforcement and appropriate disciplinary action has been taken.Armenio says she s also now the target of social media hate mail but she s taking it in stride. In high school if you really care about what every person thinks you re going to get torn apart,  Armenio said.Armenio parents say they are keeping her out of school until they know she ll be safe.If only this poor pro-Trump child had just worn #safetypins perhaps this wouldn't have happened pic.twitter.com/w07rO9OOo2   ia?GiveMeTears?

"In this #METOO moment, many powerful men are being toppled. It spans many industries, from entertainment, to journalism, to politics and beyond. Any man that ever dared to abuse his power to sexually harass, molest, or assault women better brace himself for being rooted out, publicly shamed, and forced into early retirement.Well, unfortunately, the latest bombshell story has actually resulted in the suicide of a lawmaker. Kentucky State Representative Dan Johnson left a suicide note on Facebook and then shot himself on a bridge, according to reports from local authorities. Bullitt County Sheriff Donnie Tinnell reported to local station WDRB that Johnson s body was found after his suicide note from Facebook was reported to the local police. Here is that note:Now, nobody wants to celebrate a suicide. This man should have resigned gracefully and faced his accuser, who was a friend of his daughter s, who says that Johnson molested her while she was passed out drunk in his home. Apparently, Johnson, who referred to himself as some kind of  pope,  routinely engaged in parties with plenty of alcohol with minors. Johnson s home was called the  Pope s House,  and he was the preacher at the Heart of Fire City Church, where the alleged molestation took place.Now, innocent until proven guilty and all of that, but if someone commits suicide, it s likely there could be some merit there. That s a rather extreme measure to take. Further, by all accounts, this guy was no saint. He was heavily pro-gun, opposed any and all abortion rights, and has referred to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as monkeys on his Facebook page, among other racist messages and images.Again, we re not glad the man is dead. But, it is important for people to remember him for exactly who he was. We grieve for the loss his children, wife, and grandchildren suffered, for nobody deserves such a loss. However, methinks the people of Kentucky are much better off. Sad to say, but true.Featured image via screen capture",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the Treasury Department on Friday to examine two powers given to regulators to police large financial companies following the 2008 financial crisis, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. In his first visit to the Treasury building, Trump signed two memos that analysts view as largely affirming existing priorities he has outlined. One temporarily bars regulators from identifying new non-bank financial institutions as “systemically important financial institutions,” or SIFIs, while also ordering a review of this process, Mnuchin said in a briefing with reporters. SIFIs face added regulatory oversight and must hold more capital as a buffer against losses to safeguard against risk to the financial system. The other memo directs regulators to temporarily halt the use of “orderly liquidation authority” to dissolve troubled financial institutions unless the president directs it in an emergency. Trump will order a review of this as well, Mnuchin said. Still, the government has never attempted to use its orderly liquidation authority. The memo directs the Treasury to review the authority for 180 days, focusing on whether it exposes taxpayers to losses and encourages companies to take on more risk, or whether a revamped bankruptcy process would be preferable.  Critics, including Republicans in Congress, argue the authority effectively gives some firms “too big to fail” status, which could encourage them to take on more risk and necessitate government intervention if they fail. Trump has long said financial sector oversight could curb economic growth. While the two memos indicate that revisiting the rules remains a priority, they overlap with an earlier executive order the president signed in February directing a review of all financial rules. The impact of the memos may be limited. Mnuchin had previously said his team was already looking into both the SIFI designation process and the use of orderly liquidation. The Trump administration has been expected to reduce the number of companies subject to SIFI-level policing. Only two insurers, American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N), are designated as SIFIs because they pose a systemic threat to the financial system. Banks with more than $50 billion in assets such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) are automatically designated as SIFIs by law.  Republicans, who have criticized the SIFI process as opaque and arbitrary, have introduced legislation to curb it. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel of top regulators that Mnuchin now chairs, oversees the process.  “The president will be instructing me to put a hold on that for designations until we do a thorough review and make sure that it’s a fair and transparent process,” said Mnuchin.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The political alliance sealed on Friday between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was more than a decade in the making, the culmination of the two men’s repeatedly crossing paths. Christie, a former rival for the Republican nomination for president, endorsed Trump at a surprise news conference in Fort Worth, Texas, giving the front-runner a lift ahead of the March 1 Super Tuesday nominating contests. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, told reporters his endorsement was not part of any deal that would land him a position, such as U.S. attorney general, in a possible Trump administration. Trump, 69, and Christie, 53, have been friendly dinner companions and have operated professionally in the same state. Christie has been one of New Jersey’s top political figures since 2001 and Trump has been a major employer and real-estate developer in the state beginning in the 1980s when he began to run casinos in Atlantic City, the New Jersey seaside resort that had fallen on hard times and was being remade as a sort of Las Vegas of the East Coast. The close geographic ties differentiate Christie from politicians who operate farther from Trump’s base in New York City, said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. “They were bound to cross paths and come to know each other,” Dworkin said. Trump sat in the front pew at a Catholic Mass celebrating Christie’s swearing-in for his first term as New Jersey’s governor in January 2010. “He’s going to be a great governor, which New Jersey could use. He will go down as the best governor there is,” Trump told reporters, according to the Press of Atlantic City. Trump’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, a federal appeals court judge, introduced the two in 2002, according to The Record of Bergen County. Christie was named the state’s chief federal prosecutor in 2001 by President George W. Bush. The Trumps and the Christies have often had dinner together, where Trump would do all the talking, according to “American Governor,” a Christie biography written by Matt Katz and published in January. Christie attended Trump’s 2005 wedding, to his current wife, Melania, where Christie met Bill and Hillary Clinton, according to the book. The Christie-Trump relationship, “if anything, would be socializing with big important people. They’re both collectors,” said Rutgers University senior policy fellow Marc Pfeiffer. As Christie sought to build his national profile, Trump helped. Trump gave $250,000 to the Republican Governors Association in 2014 when Christie was its head, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that maintains a database of political donations. Representatives of Trump’s casinos lobbied Christie as early as 1996 when Christie was a little-own local officeholder in Morris County, according to the Star-Ledger. The newspaper reported at the time that the county board of freeholders was considering a highway project that would affect Trump’s casinos in Atlantic City. Trump founded Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc and ran casinos in Atlantic City beginning in the 1980s. He resigned as chairman before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, about a year before Christie became governor and took on a larger role in the city’s struggles.  Trump Entertainment Resorts emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in July 2010, with Trump acquiring a smaller stake in the company. It now runs one Atlantic City casino, the Trump Taj Mahal. Christie’s biggest push for development in Atlantic City was to support the Revel casino project. The Revel opened in 2012, well after Trump had reduced his holdings in Atlantic City. It closed in 2014.  Trump’s presence in New Jersey could extend well beyond his career or friendship with Christie. According to media reports, he plans to be buried in the state at a private cemetery at one of his golf courses after he dies.

"CLARK FREEPORT ZONE, Philippines (Reuters) - Southeast Asian defense ministers on Monday expressed  grave concern  over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs and urged the reclusive country to meet its international obligations and resume communications.  North Korea is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland and has ignored all calls, even from its lone major ally, China, to rein in its weapons programs which it conducts in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Defense ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in a joint statement, underscored the  need to maintain peace and stability in the region  and called  for the exercise of self-restraint and the resumption of dialogue to de-escalate tensions in the Korean peninsula . They are due to meet with their counterparts from the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, Russia and New Zealand on Tuesday when North Korea, the disputed South China Sea and terrorism are expected to top the agenda. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said he will talk with Asian allies about North Korea and the crisis caused by its  reckless  provocations. Mattis s trip to Asia, which will also include stops in Thailand and South Korea, comes just weeks before Donald Trump s first visit to Asia as U.S. president. In the same statement, the ministers reiterated the importance of  safety and freedom of navigation in and over-flight above the South China Sea  and called for  self restraint in the conduct of activities . They also vowed to work together to combat terrorism as they condemned the attack by the Maute militant group in the southern Philippine city of Marawi.

" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to build dozens of new warships in one of the biggest peace-time expansions of the U.S. Navy. But interviews with ship-builders, unions and a review of public and internal documents show major obstacles to that plan.  The initiative could cost nearly $700 billion in government funding, take 30 years to complete and require hiring tens of thousands of skilled shipyard workers - many of whom don’t exist yet because they still need to be hired and trained, according to the interviews and the documents reviewed.  Trump has vowed a huge build-up of the U.S. military to project American power in the face of an emboldened China and Russia. That includes expanding the Navy to 350 warships from 275 today. He has provided no specifics, including how soon he wants the larger fleet. (For graphics on projected strength of U.S. Navy, shipyard employment see: tmsnrt.rs/2n3vOr0)  The Navy has given Defense Secretary Jim Mattis a report that explores how the country’s industrial base could support higher ship production, Admiral Bill Moran, the vice chief of Naval Operations with oversight of the Navy’s shipbuilding outlook, told Reuters.  He declined to give further details. But those interviewed for this story say there are clearly two big issues - there are not enough skilled workers in the market, from electricians to welders, and after years of historically low production, shipyards and their suppliers, including nuclear fuel producers, will struggle to ramp up for years.  To be sure, the first, and biggest, hurdle for Trump to overcome is to persuade a cost-conscious Congress to fund the military buildup.  The White House declined to comment. A Navy spokeswoman said increases being considered beyond the current shipbuilding plan would require “sufficient time” to allow companies to ramp up capacity.  The two largest U.S. shipbuilders, General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII.N), told Reuters they are planning to hire a total of 6,000 workers in 2017 just to meet current orders, such as the Columbia class ballistic missile submarine.  General Dynamics hopes to hire 2,000 workers at Electric Boat this year. Currently projected order levels would already require the shipyard to grow from less than 15,000 workers, to nearly 20,000 by the early 2030s, company documents reviewed by Reuters show.  Huntington Ingalls, the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, plans to hire 3,000 at its Newport News shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia, and another 1,000 at the Ingalls shipyard in Mississippi this year to fulfill current orders, spokeswoman Beci Brenton said.  Companies say they are eager to work with Trump to build his bigger Navy. But expanding hiring, for now, is difficult to do until they receive new orders, officials say.  “It’s hard to look beyond” current orders, Brenton said.  Smaller shipbuilders and suppliers are also cautious.  “You can’t hire people to do nothing,” said Jill Mackie, spokeswoman for Portland, Oregon-based Vigor Industrial LLC, which makes combat craft for the Navy’s Special Warfare units. “Until funding is there ... you can’t bring on more workers.”  Because companies won’t hire excess workers in advance, they will have a huge challenge in expanding their workforces rapidly if a shipbuilding boom materializes, said Bryan Clark, who led strategic planning for the Navy as special assistant to the chief of Naval Operations until 2013.  Union and shipyard officials say finding skilled labor just for the work they already have is challenging. Demand for pipeline welders is so strong that some can make as much as $300,000 per year, including overtime and benefits, said Danny Hendrix, the business manager at Pipeliners Local 798, a union representing 6,500 metal workers in 42 states.  Much of the work at the submarine yards also requires a security clearance that many can’t get, said Jimmy Hart, president of the Metal Trades Department at the AFL-CIO union, which represents 100,000 boilermakers, machinists, and pipefitters, among others.  To help grow a larger labor force from the ground up, General Dynamics’ Electric Boat has partnered with seven high schools and trade schools in Connecticut and Rhode Island to develop a curriculum to train a next generation of welders and engineers.  “It has historically taken five years to get someone proficient in shipbuilding,” said Maura Dunn, vice president of human resources at Electric Boat.  It can take as many as seven years to train a welder skilled enough to make the most complex type of welds, radiographic structural welds needed on a nuclear-powered submarine, said Will Lennon, vice president of the shipyard’s Columbia Class submarine program.  The Navy envisioned by Trump could create more than 50,000 jobs, the Shipbuilders Council of America, a trade group representing U.S. shipbuilders, repairers and suppliers, told Reuters.  The U.S. shipbuilding and repairing industry employed nearly 100,000 in 2016, Labor Department statistics show. The industry had as many as 176,000 workers at the height of the Cold War in the early 1980s as the United States built up a fleet of nearly 600 warships by the end of that decade.  Apart from the labor shortage, there are also serious capacity and supply chain issues that would be severely strained by any plan to expand the Navy, especially its submarine fleet.  Expanding the Navy to 350 ships is not as simple as just adding 75 ships. Many ships in the current 275-vessel fleet need to be replaced, which means the Navy would have to buy 321 ships between now and 2046 to reach Trump’s goal, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report in February.  The shipyards that make nuclear submarines - General Dynamics’ Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut, and Huntington’s Newport News - produced as many as seven submarines per year between them in the early 1980s. But for more than a decade now, the yards have not built more than two per year.  The nuclear-powered Virginia class and Columbia class submarines are among the largest and most complex vessels to build. The first Columbia submarine, which is set to begin construction in 2021, will take seven years to build, and two to three additional years to test.  Retooling the long-dormant shipyard space will take several years and significant capital investments, but a bigger problem is expanding the supply chain, said Clark, the former strategist for the Navy and now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.  Makers of submarine components such as reactor cores, big castings, and forgers of propellers and shafts would need five years to double production, said a congressional official with knowledge of the Navy’s long-term planning.  “We have been sizing the industrial base for two submarines a year. You can’t then just throw one or two more on top of that and say, ‘Oh here, dial the switch and produce four reactor cores a year instead of two.’ You just can’t,” the official said.  In his first budget proposal to Congress on Thursday, Trump proposed boosting defense spending by $54 billion for the fiscal 2018 year – a 10 percent increase from last year. He is also seeking $30 billion for the Defense Department in a supplemental budget for fiscal 2017, of which at least $433 million is earmarked for military shipbuilding.  A 350-ship Navy would cost $690 billion over the 30-year period, or $23 billion per year - 60 percent more than the average funding the Navy has received for shipbuilding in the past three decades, the Congressional Budget Office said.  Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who will have a major say in approving the defense budget, said in a statement to Reuters that he supported Trump’s vision to increase the size of the Navy to deter adversaries.  ""However, this is not a blank check,"" he said.  (Click here for a graphic on 'Fleet expansion' here)  ",1
"NAIROBI (Reuters) - A militant faction loyal to Islamic State (IS) has increased its following in northern Somalia from a few dozen last year to up to 200 this year, a U.N. report said, days after the group came under U.S. air attack for the first time. The increase in strength of the IS spin-off group has attracted attention because some security officials fear it could offer a safe haven for Islamic State militants fleeing military defeat in Syria or Iraq.   The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) faction loyal to Sheikh Abdulqader Mumin - estimated...in 2016 to number not more than a few dozen..., has growing significantly in strength, and (now) consists of as many as 200 fighters,  said the report by a panel of U.N. experts obtained by Reuters.    Even a few hundred armed fighters could destabilize the whole region,  said a regional diplomatic security source.  It(air strikes) is a recognition from the U.S. that the situation in terms of the (Islamic State) faction in Puntland is becoming increasingly critical.   Somalia has been riven by civil war and Islamist militancy, though more in the south than in the north where the Puntland region is located, since 1991 when clan warlords overthrew a dictator before turning on each other.      Friday s air strikes failed to kill Mumin, the security source said. But Abdirizak Ise Hussein, director of semi-autonomous Puntland s spy service, said the strikes killed about 20 militants, including a Sudanese fighter and two Arabs.  Almost all Mumin s fighters are Somali, the U.N. report said, though the group is believed to include a Sudanese man sanctioned by the United States. The group also has contacts in Yemen. It was unclear if the Sudanese man under U.S. sanctions was the same one reported killed in the air strike.   The number of IS fighters in Puntland has increased. Mostly they come from southern Somalia and a few, including foreigners, come from Yemen,  Colonel Abdirahman Saiid, a military officer in Puntland, told Reuters. The U.N. report said defectors from Mumin s faction reported the group had received money and orders from Iraq and Syria, and one member said he had seen Mumin and another leader using TrueCrypt software to communicate with them. The United Nations could not independently verify those claims.  Mumin s group has been slowing increasing its activity over the past year. In late 2016, it occupied the port of Qandala in Puntland, a semi-autonomous region, for a month.  Earlier this year, it carried out its first attacks. Its fighters killed four guards at a hotel in Bosasso, the economic capital of Puntland, in February. The same month, the group beheaded three men it had kidnapped. Somalia s main Islamist insurgent group, al Shabaab, is aligned with al Qaeda and is most active in the Horn of Africa country s south. It has repeatedly clashed with the Islamic State-aligned faction in the north.  ",1

The U.S is the land of opportunity and dreams for many people all over the world.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is likely to launch a small donor fundraising effort akin to the grassroots one that powered another insurgent presidential contender, Democrat Bernie Sanders, according to two top donors who attended the first official meeting of Trump’s national finance team.  The Trump finance machine kickoff took place at New York City’s Four Seasons Hotel amid growing concerns about the Republican presidential candidate’s lack of a campaign infrastructure heading into a Nov. 8 election battle against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “The pitch to this group in the room was a traditional pitch, but the backroom discussion was, because of this being a populist movement, there’s going to be significant outreach to, you know, those who give $1, $2, $20,” said Trump Texas fundraising co-chairman Gaylord Hughey. “There’s a huge opportunity there.” Sanders, who has effectively lost the 2016 presidential nomination to Clinton, broke fundraising records during his long-shot bid for the presidency, collecting more than $210 million through more than 7.4 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece.    Trump could well find his supporters eager to pitch in $1, $5 or $20. For a story in May, Reuters found that nearly all three dozen Trump supporters it interviewed were not only unmoved by Trump’s about-face to accept money from outside donors, they said they would also happily contribute. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment about replicating the fundraising apparatus of Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont. Some donors were fearful of the late start of Thursday’s gathering. Normally such a meeting would take place two years earlier in a candidate’s campaign. But others in attendance said they left assured that Trump would be able to easily plug into the Republican National Committee’s robust infrastructure. Trump, a wealthy businessman, became the presumptive Republican nominee last month after seeing off 16 rivals in a largely self-funded primary campaign. The gathering featured talks by Trump, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, chief strategist Paul Manafort, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, former rival-turned-ally Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Republican fundraisers Ray Washburne and Lew Eisenberg. Trump’s late start on fundraising has raised questions about whether he can achieve his previously stated aim of raising $1 billion before November. On the Democratic side, Clinton’s well-oiled operation is well ahead of schedule. Trump is also pulling back from his earlier statements on his fundraising goal. Campaign manager Lewandowski told Reuters on Wednesday that he sees no need for Trump to raise that sum and that Trump may be able to stick to his low-cost style of campaigning. That includes garnering free media, which is estimated will reach a value of $5 billion by November, according to media analytics firm mediaQuant. That is more than double what Clinton is likely to get, mediaQuant says. While Trump shot to the top of the Republican race with freewheeling rhetoric, insults of rivals and promises to get tough on issues such as illegal immigration, even his biggest donors say they are discouraged by the candidate’s attacks in recent weeks on a Mexican-American judge. In comments that have been widely condemned, Trump has suggested that U.S. Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a case against Trump University, has an inherent bias because of his heritage. “He needs to stop the campaign infighting, shut up and stop calling an American who was born in Indiana a Mexican,” said Texas billionaire Doug Deason.

"On Sunday night, actress Meryl Streep called out president-elect Donald Trump s behavior without even mentioning his name. That was too much for Trump supporters to handle and Kellyanne Conway, the president-elect s mouthpiece, was not happy about it. In response to Ms. Streep s impassioned speech at the Golden Globe awards, Conway said that instead, the actress should have called for unity behind the president-elect. That s sort of the opposite of what Trump is doing right now on Twitter while bashing Meryl Streep because of his fragile ego. We have to now form a government, and I m concerned that somebody with a platform like Meryl Streep is also, I think, inciting people s worst instincts,  Conway said.

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airline Lufthansa said on Friday it had changed its flight routes to Japan because of North Korean missile tests. Lufthansa Group, which owns Swiss, Lufthansa, and Lufthansa Cargo, had already been avoiding direct overflights of North Korean airspace for more than a year, the company said. “As a result of the latest North Korean missile tests, Lufthansa Group has decided for now to change routings to and from Japan, purely as a precautionary measure,” the airline said, adding that changes to the flight time were negligible. Air France-KLM said on Thursday it had expanded its no-fly zone over North Korea after one of its jets flew past the location where an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) splashed down 10 minutes later. Air France’s flight 293, a Boeing 777 carrying 323 people from Tokyo to Paris, missed North Korea’s latest ICBM as it fell to earth on July 28 by about 100 km (60 miles), a spokesman for Air France-KLM said, citing flight data provided by Japan. North Korea said a week ago that its latest ICBM test proved its ability to strike the U.S. mainland, drawing a sharp warning from President Donald Trump and a rebuke from China. ",1
"Where s the accountably? As our President ramps up his gun control rhetoric in the U.S., we continue to see the fallout from of a botched government gun running program dubbed  Fast N  Furious.  How can this duplicitous President carry on about guns falling into the wrong hands in the U.S. while sending illegal guns over to Mexico to be used by drug lords against U.S. law enforcement and possibly against American civilians? A .50-caliber rifle found at Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman s hideout in Mexico was funneled through the gun-smuggling investigation known as Fast and Furious, sources confirmed Tuesday to Fox News.A .50-caliber is a massive rifle that can stop a car, or as it was intended, take down a helicopter.After the raid on Jan. 8 in the city of Los Mochis that killed five of his men and wounded one Mexican marine, officials found a number of weapons inside the house Guzman was staying, including the rifle, officials said.When agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives checked serial numbers of the eight weapons found in his possession, they found one of the two .50-caliber weapons traced back to the ATF program, sources said.Federal officials told Fox News they are not sure how many of the weapons seized from Guzman s house actually originated in the U.S. and where they were purchased, but are investigating.Out of the roughly 2,000 weapons sold through Fast and Furious, 34 were .50 caliber rifles that can take down a helicopter, according to officials.Federal law enforcement sources told Fox News that  El Chapo  would put his guardsmen on hilltops to be on guard for Mexican police helicopters that would fly through valleys conducting raids. The sole purpose of the guardsmen would be to shoot down those helicopters, sources said.The Fast and Furious operation involved federal agents allowing criminals to buy guns with the intention of tracking them.Instead, agents from the ATF lost track of 1,400 of the 2,000 guns involved in the sting operation.The operation allowed criminals to buy guns in Phoenix-area shops with the intention of tracking them once they made their way into Mexico.After years of legal battles between the House Oversight Committee and Attorney General Eric Holder, 64,280 redacted Operation Fast and Furious documents held under President Obama s assertion of executive privilege since 2012, have been turned over by the Department of Justice after an order from U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson. When Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judge s order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and President Obama illegitimately and illegally withheld from Congress. Since these pages still do not represent the entire universe of the documents the House of Representatives is seeking related to the Justice Department s cover-up of the botched gun-walking scandal that contributed to the death of a Border Patrol agent, our court case will continue,  Chairman Darrell Issa said in a statement.  I am deeply concerned that some redactions to these documents may still be inappropriate and contrary to the judge s order in the case. These documents being turned over is long awaited confirmation from both DOJ and the White House that officials withheld 64,280 documents that do not, and never did, fall under President Obama s executive privilege claims. As a reminder, President Obama asserted executive privilege in this case just moments before Holder was voted in contempt of Congress in June 2012. The President and the Attorney General attempted to extend the scope of the Executive Privilege well beyond its historical boundaries to avoid disclosing documents that embarrass or otherwise implicate senior Obama Administration officials,  an Oversight Committee release states.  In effect, last night s production is an admission that the Justice Department never had legitimate grounds to withhold these documents in the first place. Approximately two-thirds of the universe of documents that the Justice Department withheld from Congress has now been shown to be well outside the scope of Executive Privilege. The operation became a major distraction for the Obama administration as Republicans in Congress conducted a series of inquiries into how the Justice Department allowed such an operation to happen.Former Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt after he refused to divulge documents for a congressional investigation into the matter.This is the third time a weapon from the Fast and Furious program has been found at a high-profile Mexican crime scene.Via: FOX News",0
"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s endorsement from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie opens up a wide network of donors, advisers and prominent elected officials whom the billionaire has not yet been able to attract to his unorthodox bid for the Republican presidential nomination. As Trump tries to lock up the Republican nomination on Super Tuesday, Christie advisers and supporters told Reuters in interviews that he could bring much-needed financial and strategic backing.  Christie’s backing demonstrates that Trump will be able to bring establishment politicians into the fold, that he could raise the money necessary for a general election campaign and build a staffing operation that can rival a Democratic nominee.      The nod from Christie comes at a critical moment. On Tuesday, 11 states will vote and if Trump is able to win all or most of them, he could pull so far ahead in the competition for delegates that none of his rivals will be able to catch him. In an interview with Reuters, Christie supporter Finn Wentworth, a real estate investor and former head of the company that owns the New York Yankees, New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils, said he is now seriously considering backing Trump. “I am a long-time supporter of Governor Christie. In that process, I have learned to respect his opinion and his judgment,” Wentworth said. “He’s a results-oriented person, and frankly I am now looking at Donald Trump because of Governor Christie’s endorsement today.” Maine Governor Paul LePage, who had backed Christie initially, quickly followed in the New Jersey governor’s footsteps and got behind Trump - making him the second sitting governor to endorse the New York real estate mogul. Maine votes on March 5.  A senior Christie aide told Reuters he believes staff could move to the Trump campaign in the coming weeks, helping the Republican front-runner in his fledgling efforts to build a circle of advisers who could form the core of his general election campaign should he clinch the nomination. Wentworth said part of his decision-making process is that he is now convinced it is inevitable that Trump will clinch the Republican nomination. Dale Florio, a donor to Christie, said he, along with others, has a call scheduled with the New Jersey governor later on Friday. “If he says, I’d like you guys to support Donald Trump, I’ll be there for him,” Florio said. Trump has thus far avoided traditional fundraising. However, more than half of his campaign spending in 2015 was covered by money raised through the sale of his “Make America Great Again” hats and T-shirts, even though he told his supporters not to write donation checks. But as a nominee, that position may be impossible to stick to, especially if Clinton is the Democratic nominee and she is able to build a sizable arsenal. Christie’s endorsement could have the power to bring more establishment-aligned officials and donors into Trump’s camp. Christie could also serve as a surrogate fundraiser. Christie is no stranger to the nation’s top Republican donors. In 2014, he served as the head of the Republican Governors Association, a role that largely consists of traveling the nation and raising money for Republican gubernatorial candidates. Christie was one of the most successful heads the organization has ever seen. Rob Gray, a Republican strategist who had been advising Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who dropped out of the race last Saturday, called the endorsement a “stunning surprise.”  “Christie’s endorsement is an indicator to me Trump is starting to mainstream his candidacy and that he’ll be able to attract a lot of mainstream experienced political leaders’ support if he gets the nomination,” Gray said. “I wasn’t as sure before this.” The biggest boost Christie may have offered Trump was a distraction from the coverage of Marco Rubio’s Thursday night debate performance and increased scrutiny in some of his business endeavors, like Trump University, a defunct venture that offered real estate investing seminars and which is currently the target of lawsuits. Both Rubio and Ted Cruz, Trump’s two biggest challengers, battered away at Trump in Thursday’s televised debate - the last before Super Tuesday. “I’m sure Rubio and Cruz at the very least had things that they wanted to do today to follow up from their narrative last night and this kind of sucked the air out,” said Tom Rath, who is advising the campaign of Ohio Governor John Kasich.

"Does your child spend time on social media? Unless they re Amish, you should probably assume they do. My teenage daughter just shared with me one of the most racist, self-loathing articles with me that I have ever seen in print. This is the most hateful, racist articles aimed at shaming young, white Americans that you ve have ever seen. As we took a closer look at students featured in this  Buzzfeed  article, we were stunned by some of the racist postings we found on their social media accounts.I suppose it s okay for Buzzfeed to publish an article with the sole purpose of bashing its young white users, because thanks to Barack and Michelle Obama (the ultimate victims), who have been sowing the seeds of racism, division and hate from the White House, it s perfectly acceptable to trash white Americans. Never mind that Barack Obama is the President of the United States. What black United States President who was elected twice by a majority white nation would still consider himself and his wife victims of racism?  Here are some of the examples we found from the Buzzfeed article titled:  19 School Powerpoint Presentations That Give Zero F*cks  This article, and hundreds more just like it, show up in your children s Snapchat social media feeds, a place where teenagers and young adults frequently go to interact with each other, and where they are constantly bombarded with leftist indoctrination garbage like this: Controversial Tay  appears to be very proud of herself and how she s stirring it up at school, she actually goes as far as to say,  One day I feel like my professors just gon stop letting me do presentations.

She quickly turns it into a race issue, using his statement about the controlling the borders to suggest he,  doesn t want too many Latinos in our country.  She tells him  because you are white and you are so closed-minded  that he  doesn t accept the truth.  The teacher calls her out on her previous statement that,  white people are in control of everything,  by asking her what color our current President is? Watch how she quickly blames Congress for being white, which apparently makes a black man who holds the highest office in our nation somehow insignificant.

Many of our educators are also indoctrinating our children with the,  all white s are racists  narrative. When are parents going to start taking a stand, and tell the educators at the schools their children attend they are not going to stand by and watch them shame their children? It may be all the rage in high schools and colleges to unfairly accuse white people of racism and hate, but that doesn t mean you, or your kids have to go along with it.For the entire slide show, go to Buzzfeed. Make sure to leave a comment, and let them know how you feel about the garbage they re putting out to your kids disguised as  news.  Teenagers and young adults have a hard enough time dealing with self-image and everyday teenage insecurities. Suicide rates and depression are off the charts for teens. Buzzfeed is just doing their part to pile on, and make your kids feel guilty or ashamed for the color of skin they were born with. ",0
"The Office of Government Ethics has said that Ivanka Trump must file financial disclosure forms, and that she s barred from participating in anything related to the Trump family s businesses because she s an adviser to her father in the White House. The ethics office was never contacted about her role, revealing yet another area in which the White House is either sorely ignorant or sorely corrupt (most likely both).Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tom Carper asked the ethics office about the rules that Ivanka is supposed to follow. At the time they asked, Ivanka was in the process of getting her government-issued devices and a security clearance, and her lawyer had already said she would stick to the same ethics rules applied to every other government employee.This is what the ethics office told Warren and Carper about the ethics rules applying to her: [T]he primary criminal conflict of interest statue prohibits senior White House appointees and other executive branch employees from participating personally and substantially in particular matters directly and predictably affecting their financial interests. Among other things, this prohibition extends to the financial interests of companies in which they have ownership interests the primary criminal conflict of interest statute prohibits Ms. Trump from participating in particular matters affecting her financial interests, including the financial interests of Trump family businesses and other companies in which she has an ownership interest. That conflict of interest statute also covers her spouse s financial interests, which are imputed to her. So even if her husband, Jared Kushner, didn t have his own White House office, he still couldn t participate in the Trump Organization either.Ivanka s company was granted trademarks in China the same day she had dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The company said that the new trademarks are normal for the business that they do, and she did place her company in a trust and resigned from her position in the Trump Organization to accept her White House role. The Trump Organization, however, has likewise received a number of trademarks in China since Trump took office.She maintains financial control of her own company, though, as well as an interest in Washington s Trump International Hotel, according to The New York Times. These ethics rules apply to financial interests, even for employees and executives who ve formally resigned from their positions in their businesses. And those Chinese trademarks, granted after she took her post in the White House, could violate the ethics rules to which she s bound. Her ability to approve or deny certain deals through her trust may violate those rules as well.Unfortunately, ethics compliance is under the purview of the White House, and the White House is pretty loyal to Donald Trump and has shown zero interest in ensuring ethical compliance. The ethics office doesn t have enforcement power   they just issue guidance. Congressional Democrats now have a powerful case against Ivanka should it come to light that she s violating these rules, though.There s word for this if she doesn t bring herself into full compliance: Corruption.Featured image by Sean Gallup via Getty Images",0

"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s economy is forecast to grow 6.9 percent next year,  compared with a projected 6.8 percent pace in 2017, despite risks including uncertainties over next year s election, the World Bank said on Wednesday. Cambodia s political turbulence has had little impact on economic growth, which has hovered around 7 percent for the past six years. The World Bank said textile exports had moderated and the construction sector showed signs of slowing, but other manufacturing exports had increased and Cambodia was also drawing more tourists - particularly from China.  The outlook remains positive,  it said in a report.  A possible slowdown of the regional economy, especially China, and potential election related uncertainties, however, pose downside risks to the outlook.  China is now Cambodia s biggest aid donor and investor, but Western donors remain important and Cambodia has been increasingly at odds with them in the run-up to the 2018 election. They have condemned the arrest of Prime Minister Hun Sen s main rival, Kem Sokha, the dissolution of the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) and a crackdown on civil rights groups and independent media. The government accuses Kem Sokha of plotting to take power with American help and his party of treason - charges the opposition says are politically motivated to ensure Hun Sen keeps his more than three-decade hold on power. Sweden said on Tuesday it was stopping some aid and the United States said it was ending election funding and would take further concrete steps. World Bank senior country economist Miguel Sanchez said uncertainty had affected Cambodia in previous election years, leading to postponed investment decisions and a decline in foreign currency deposits.  It was temporary,  he told a news conference. ",1

Asked whether he would answer questions from Mueller, Trump told Fox Business Network in an interview that aired on Monday: “I don’t know. Nobody’s asked me to do that.” ",1
"When will the libs start Delta Smelt shaming and demand answers from the left for putting a fish before the lives and livelihood of so many TV cop Tom Selleck may or may not have improperly swiped precious water by the magnum, but he didn t commit a crime, real California cops told NBC News on Wednesday.Selleck, the 70-year-old star of  Blue Bloods  and formerly of  Magnum, P.I.,  and his wife, Jillie, were sued this week by the Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County for allegedly sending a water tender   like the giant tanker trucks used to supply fire engines   to siphon off tankloads of water from a public hydrant at a construction site at least 12 times over the last two years.The water district said in its suit that it hired a real private investigator who several times observed the same water tender leave the 61-acre ranch the fictional P.I. owns in the ritzy Hidden Valley area of Ventura County, which is in a different water district and was assessed last year at more than $10 million (and was once owned by Dean Martin).The suit says the water district sent cease-and-desist letters to Selleck after its investigator spotted the truck at the hydrant eight times the week of Sept. 29, 2013.But the truck showed up again in December of that year, and was tracked as it proceeded to Selleck s property, according to the suit.Then, on four straight days just last March, the same truck again drained tankloads of water from the construction site and delivered it to the Selleck ranch, the suit says. The suit seeks an order forcing Selleck to stop using the district s water, plus reimbursement for the $21,685.55 it paid the investigator, with damages and other costs.But the suit is a civil action, not a criminal case. Ventura County sheriff s Capt. John Riley meanwhile told NBC News that the sheriff s office did investigate allegations of criminal water theft, but  we are unable to establish a crime was committed. The Ventura County district attorney s office also confirmed that no case has been referred to it for prosecution.Selleck hasn t responded to requests for comment, and it s unknown whether he has anything to do with the water truck, which is registered under a commercial license.Eric Bergh, the water district s manager of resources, said the suit wasn t meant to be an example of  drought shaming,  a peculiarly California activity in which people suspected of hogging water are publicly called out. Our policies have been on the books for decades,  Bergh said.  We just want any such activity to stop   that is the bottom line for us. It s really about doing the right thing and preserving our water supply for our users. Via: CNBC",0
"(Reuters) - Officials in Florida and Virginia filed voter fraud charges against three people in apparently unrelated cases on Friday, just 11 days before American voters cast ballots in the hotly contested presidential race. The charges targeted a Florida woman and a Virginia man accused of filing bogus voter registration forms and a Florida woman 	alleged to have tampered with absentee ballots she was opening at the Miami-Dade Elections Department. In the Iowa capital of Des Moines, county election officials referred three cases of suspected voter fraud to police earlier this week, leading to one arrest on Thursday, police said. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has charged in recent weeks that the election will be rigged in favor of Democrat Hillary Clinton, though he has shown no proof for these claims and many Republicans have called them unfounded. Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle in Florida said that 74-year-old Gladys Coego had been working as an absentee ballot opener when a supervisor allegedly saw her changing ballots that had been left blank to support a mayoral candidate. Prosecutors said that Coego admitted to marking the ballots and was charged with two felony counts of marking or designating the ballot of another. “The integrity of the electoral process is intact because our procedures work,” said Christina White, the county’s election supervisor, in a statement. Tomika Curgil, 33, was charged with five felony counts of submitting false voter registration information for allegedly handing in forms filled out by fictitious voters while working on a voter-registration drive for a medical marijuana advocacy group. A Virginia man was also charged with submitting falsified forms while working for a voter-registration campaign, state prosecutors said. Vafalay Massaquoi, 30, was arraigned on two felony counts of forging a public record and two counts of voter registration fraud. “There is no allegation that any illegal vote was actually cast in this case,” said Virginia Commonwealth’s Attorney Bryan Porter. “Furthermore, since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered, the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.” Neither Coego, Curgil nor Massaquoi could be reached for immediate comment. Police in Des Moines on Thursday arrested a woman who was accused of voting twice - casting early-voting ballots at two locations - in one of three cases of suspected voter fraud reported by the Polk County Auditor’s Office. Police did not disclose the political affiliation of the woman, identified as Terri Lynn Rote, 55, but the Des Moines Register newspaper reported she was a registered Republican. A man in Texas, where early voting started on Monday, was arrested on Monday on charges of electioneering and loitering near a polling place, public records show.  The man, Brett Mauthe, had been charged for showing up to vote in a Trump hat and T-shirt with the phrase “basket of deplorables,” a reference to a comment Clinton made disparaging her rivals’ supporters, election officials told media.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats urged the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday to review President Donald Trump’s tax returns, as part of a campaign in Congress that has begun to show signs of attracting Republican support. Defying decades of precedent, Trump has refused to release his tax returns while his tax affairs are under federal audit. Democrats and other critics contend that the documents could show whether his global business empire poses any conflicts of interest as the president moves his agenda forward on issues ranging from tax reform to foreign relations. In a letter dated Wednesday, seven Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee urged the panel’s Republican chairman, Orrin Hatch, to request the documents from the U.S. Treasury so that lawmakers can review them in a closed session and determine whether the returns can be released to the public. Democrats in the House of Representatives said they planned to pose a similar request on Thursday to Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady in a bipartisan letter signed by 140 lawmakers, including House Republicans Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Walter Jones of North Carolina. The Democratic efforts face long odds in the Republican-controlled Congress. Three attempts in the House have met with defeat this year. Hatch and Brady responded to the Senate request in a joint letter saying Democrats were suggesting “an abuse of the tax-writing committees’ statutory authority” that would set “a dangerous precedent”.  Democrats say they hope to create a bipartisan juggernaut to require the disclosure of Trump’s and future presidents’ tax returns by pushing forward on multiple fronts.  On Monday, the House voted down a Democratic effort seeking the Republican president’s returns, with Sanford and Jones voting “present” rather than opposing the measure.  Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine told an interviewer last month she could be open to a subpoena of Trump’s taxes as part of a Senate Intelligence Committee probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections. On Wednesday, Politico quoted Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as saying he wanted presidential candidates to be required by law to release their tax returns beginning in 2020. “The tax return is the lowest ethical bar that you can have for a presidential nominee or a president,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, top Senate Finance Democrat who introduced legislation in January requiring nominees and sitting presidents to disclose their returns.

"ATHENS (Reuters) - Refugees and migrants in Greece receive little or no medical care for most health problems they face and fewer than half of those pregnant had access to maternal care, aid group Doctors of the World said on Tuesday. About 60,000 migrants and refugees are stranded in Greece, most in overcrowded camps with unsanitary conditions. More than half of this year s 20,000 arrivals were women and children, United Nations data shows.  Doctors of the World interviewed over 14,000 women treated at its clinics in Greece over three years and found fewer than 47 percent had access to antenatal care before it intervened. It also found as many as 72 percent of the health problems refugees faced were treated  inadequately  or not at all.   While most countries offer new arrivals some kind of medical screening, the quality was  questionable  and overlooked mental health problems, the charity said. Often, women did not seek medical care because they were unaware of their rights, they found the healthcare system too complex or they were afraid of being arrested or discriminated against. Limited resources and lack of access to services such as translators also posed practical obstacles.  Every mother deserves good care before, during and post pregnancy. Their residential status should not affect this basic right,  said Nikitas Kanakis, head of Doctors of the World Greece. The charity, together with healthcare company MSD, known in the United States as Merck, is implementing a two-year initiative aimed at providing maternal healthcare services to pregnant women and babies from vulnerable populations in Greece. Asylum seekers in Greece have free access to hospitals and medical care but the public health system, already battered by years of economic crisis, is struggling to cope with the numbers.  Adult migrants without documents only have access to emergency care unless they are considered  vulnerable .  Access to quality maternal healthcare can save lives, yet across Europe the most vulnerable pregnant women are still facing challenges in accessing this basic care,  said Mary-Ann Etiebet, director of MSD for Mothers.  A lack of antenatal care to prevent and identify conditions that may harm the fetus or mother increases the risk of complications during childbirth or passing on diseases such as HIV or Hepatitis B, the World Health Organisation says.  We must work together this address this issue before it escalates further,  Etiebet said. (The story is refiled to clarify MSD name in paragraph 8) ",1
"British comic Peter Serafinowicz has made everybody s day by dubbing over one of Donald Trump s hate-filled speeches with a cockney accent   and it s brilliant.Serafinowicz, originally from Liverpool in England (home of The Beatles), is well known for serving up impressions of Al Pacino and other big name celebrities. But now he has set himself the challenge of punking Donald Trump.It began a short while ago, with the comic dubbing an interview Trump gave to Fox News with an aristocratic English accent, in a video he called  Sophisticated Trump.  But now it was time for the sequel, So on Friday morning, Serafinowicz tweeted the new video to his 750,000 Twitter followers, saying: I gave Donald Trump a cockney tough guy accent.

But you ve not been punched until you ve been punked Brit-style.Even members of the UK parliament laid into Trump with typical British humor during a recent debate about banning the trust fund tycoon from entering Britain, under rules designed to prevent hate-speech.As Addicting Info reported at the time:The 3-hour debate was done more out of respect for the process of public petitions, and due to the huge number of signatures, rather than because they were legitimately serious about banning him. However, it did give Parliament time with which to vent their frustrations and engage in some brilliant Trump bashing, which is something we can all thoroughly appreciate.Using quintessential British putdowns such as  pillock ,  buffoon, and  wazzock , lawmakers from all sides of the political spectrum of our closest ally destroyed Donald Trump.It looks like it s not only American liberals that want Trump out of the Presidential race. Our allies around the world are holding their collective breath in hope too.Featured Image via Flickr/Flickr",0
"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made a historic visit to Jerusalem’s Western Wall on Monday, standing before the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray and saying a few words before inserting a note between the monumental stones. He was accompanied by the Rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinowitz, who said on Israel Radio that he recited two psalms with the U.S. leader. One of them, Psalm 122, speaks of Jerusalem as a “city that is united together”. The ancient stones are in a part of Jerusalem that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It considers all of Jerusalem its indivisible capital, a status that is not recognized internationally. “(Trump) said that he understands the significance of the Western Wall for the Jewish people and that’s why he decided to visit here during his first trip to Israel. He is certain he will come here again, perhaps many times. He was very moved,” Rabinowitz said. “He asked about the size of the Western Wall. We presented the maps, what was in the past, what’s happening now, the excavations, the finds.” The president was joined on the visit by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew who went to the wall shortly after Trump and said prayers. Both he and Trump wore black kippahs, the skull caps worn by religious Jews and by others as a mark of respect.  After a few moments standing silently before the limestone edifice, his right hand resting on the blocks, Trump withdrew and smiled briefly. He did not walk backwards from the wall as religious Jews do as a sign of devotion. It is the first time a sitting U.S. president has visited and prayed at the site. Barack Obama visited in 2008, but it was during the campaign, before he became president. The Wall, the visible portion of which stands more than 60 feet (20 meters) high, was a retaining structure for the second Jewish temple, which stood on an esplanade in the Old City before being destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. The site is known to Jews as Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism, and to Muslims as The Noble Sanctuary, where al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and the gold-topped Dome of the Rock, now stand. Access to much of the walled Old City, which is divided into four ‘quarters’ — Muslim, Christian, Armenian and Jewish — was shut down on Monday ahead of Trump’s visit. The area has been the scene of multiple stabbing attacks by Palestinians targeting Jews over the past couple of years.  As Trump and Kushner visited the area of the wall set aside for men, Melania Trump and Ivanka, Kushner’s wife, visited a separate nearby section where women are allowed to pray.  Like her husband, Melania held her right hand up against the towering stones and inserted a note among the cracks, something Jews often do as a means of submitting prayers. Ivanka, who converted to Judaism on marrying her husband, was dressed demurely in black and wore her hair partially covered by a small hat. Video footage showed her crying as she prayed at the wall. Trump’s visit to the site sparked some controversy during the planning. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had sought to accompany Trump to the Western Wall. But the State Department said that would not be permitted as officially the Wall is in East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied 50 years ago, and Palestinians seek as the capital of a future state. ",1
"The New York Times gave the accused sexual predator, Ben Affleck s new movie a thumbs up, but neglects to mention the sexual predator allaegations against him.Immediately after the Weinstein accusations started to come out, actress Hilarie Burton accused Ben Affleck of sexually assaulting her during a filming. Shanice Brim told Burton how sorry she was that Affleck sexually assaulted her, saying,  It s infuriating that people never bring up all the gross, predatory things he s done. He also grabbed Hilarie Burton's breasts on TRL once. Everyone forgot though.  Shanice Brim (@ShaniceBrim) October 10, 2017Actress Hilarie Burton responded,  I didn t forget. I m so sorry that happened to you. It s infuriating that people never bring up all the gross, predatory things he s done.  Shanice Brim (@ShaniceBrim) October 11, 2017Here s a video of Ben Affleck where he allegedly grabbed the actress  breasts:https://t.co/wh2MpJVQzlGirls. I'm so impressed with you brave ones. I had to laugh back then so I wouldn't cry. Sending love.  Hilarie Burton (@HilarieBurton) October 11, 2017Ben Affleck was also accused by one of Harvey Weinstein s victims of covering up sexual assault, after he made a comment about how  saddened  and  angry  he was at his bestie Harvey Weinstein for his actions:You want to play let's play #ROSEARMY pic.twitter.com/uqd26Z78gc  rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) October 10, 2017Here s the Justice League star in another disgusting video where he s clearly objectifying the female reporter:[VIDEO] Ben Affleck objectifies female reporter, comments on her breasts, then makes fun of ""retarded"" people with cerebral palsy. #cringe pic.twitter.com/5OiBtYkkVB  Austen Fletcher (@fleccas) October 12, 2017To add insult to injury, only days ago, Affleck appeared on MTV, where he gave a cringeworthy, and very arrogant interview about the new Justice League movie, along with his co-stars. The Mercury News published a story following his interview where they asked,  Does Ben Affleck really want to stop people from writing him off as an arrogant male movie star who lacks the character or good sense to move past his difficult associations with sexual harassment? Does he really want people to believe he can  be part of the solution  to ending a Hollywood culture that long allowed rich and powerful men like Harvey Weinstein to sexually mistreat women?Does he at least want to save his new movie  Justice League  from more bad press, after critics gave it generally negative reviews?Then Affleck better shut up, especially after his latest cringe-worthy comments surfaced.For an MTV  Justice League  cast interview last week, the Batman actor jauntily chomped his way through a big wad a gum while cracking a couple jokes that appeared to reference the sexual misconduct engulfing his industry, the Huffington Post reported. We could use more women!  Affleck said, perhaps trying to sound like he wanted to correct Hollywood s notorious gender disparity in movie narratives.But when his co-star Ray Fisher, who plays Cyborg in the film, was asked what would happen if Supergirl teamed up with the  Justice League,  the younger actor said in a very PR-friendly way,  I think it would create a different dynamic. That s when Affleck, failing to read the room or to grasp his own lack of charm in this situation, blurted out.  You following the news at all? He broke into a smile, chomping his gum some more, apparently thinking he was being very clever in referencing the sexual misconduct crisis that has engulfed his industry.Here s the arrogant and NOT funny interview: pic.twitter.com/o3bMi4WWQ5    (@stormpiIott) November 13, 2017Even the hard-core leftist publication Slate, gives their readers a list of movies they beleive will be affected by the Weinstein scandal and those who were close to the accused rapist, who are also facing sexual misconduct charges. The New York Times, however, has chosen to ignore Affleck s bad behavior in their review, however. We re pretty sure that given their history of bashing conservatives, if Affleck wasn t a mega-Democrat donor, his name would ve been the focus of the New York Times headline From Slate   Justice League (debut- November 17)  The Justice League press tour was going to be plenty difficult even before the Weinstein scandal went wide: As the movie underwent a director switch and major reshoots, rumors flew that Warner Bros. might be looking to bump an erratic Ben Affleck from his perch as Batman. Now, Affleck has been implicated in the Weinstein scandal by actress Rose McGowan, who claims the actor knew that Weinstein had assaulted her two decades ago, even though his recent statement on the matter pled na vet . McGowan s tweet  Ben Affleck fuck off  went viral and prompted renewed scrutiny of the actor s own behavior; Affleck has since apologized to actress Hilarie Burton for groping her during a long-ago TRL appearance.NYT s    Justice League,  the newest DC Comics superhero jam directed by Zack Snyder, is looser, goosier and certainly more watchable than the last one. The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie,  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,  was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay, etc.), but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup. The story is a confusion of noise, visual clutter and murderous digital gnats, but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through.The last time he fronted a movie, Superman (Henry Cavill) seemed to die, a plot twist that not even the most credulous viewer could buy. So, of course he s back in this one, eventually, although first the band needs to get together. Having seen trouble on the horizon, Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne   played with a sepulchral growl and bespoke stubble by Ben Affleck   takes the lead on this enterprise. He s the insistent manager as well as the scowling host, the guy with the cool digs, smooth rides with blinking screens ( critical damage  reads one with great comic-book sincerity) and suave butler (Jeremy Irons as Alfred). He s also pretty much of a yawn.The pumped-up Mr. Affleck again fills out the bat suit from ripped stem to stern, but his costume remains grievously larger than Batman s (or Bruce s) personality. Bat-Bruce clearly has some kind of unrequited thing for Wonder Woman, a.k.a. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot, a charming super-presence), which leads him to stammer like a teenager. (She s got other things on her mind.) He has money and a modest sense of humor, including about his wealth, which inspires one of the movie s few decent laughs. Mr. Affleck, a generally appealing actor who can plumb the depths when pushed ( Gone Girl ), needs something more substantial (or just more jokes) if his Batman is ever going to work.Cyborg isn t as buoyant a presence, which makes sense for a character who s been partly cobbled together from scraps and a sob story that Mr. Fisher puts across with bowed head and palpable heaviness. The hoodie he sometimes wears, which can t help but evoke Trayvon Martin, imparts a larger meaning that the movie doesn t or can t explore. Like the references to a coming world catastrophe that suggestively shudders with wider implications, the hoodie suggests filmmakers who are still struggling to keep an eye on the offscreen world while spinning a fictional universe that can somehow offer a brief escape from it.

"Usually, once the peaceful transfer of power is complete, the outgoing administration lays low so as not to disrupt what the new administration is doing. However, since the GOP has control of the entire federal government and most of the state level governments with the corrupt, incompetent Donald Trump at the helm, it is literally impossible for former officials of the Obama White House to keep from weighing in. This is especially true since the GOP Senators have rolled out a  healthcare bill  that is literally nothing more than a massive tax cut for rich people. The most vulnerable among us will literally die if this monstrosity of a bill becomes law. Therefore it should come as no surprise that former Vice President Joe Biden is weighing in.Taking to Twitter, Uncle Joe minced no words about what the GOP is about to unleash upon the nation:The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all it's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy & corporations.  Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 23, 2017Slashing Medicaid hurts kids, the elderly, people with disabilities and those struggling with addiction. All for tax breaks for the wealthy.  Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 23, 2017Especially now, when so many communities are struggling with opioid addiction, the bill's drastic cuts to Medicaid are cruel.  Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 23, 2017Let's see a bill that actually tries to improve folks' health care, and then we can have a reasonable debate about how to best do that.  Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 23, 2017It would be great if Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and all the rest of the GOP wanted to actually help people. Make no mistake though   they don t. They don t care about people, they care about themselves, keeping power, and making sure they and their rich friends get richer   even if it means that every day Americans literally die.In fact, it is perfectly plausible that Paul Ryan thinks that the most vulnerable among us deserve to die. After all, this is the man who openly admitted to dreaming about bringing about the end of the life-saving care provided for the most vulnerable among us since he was a college kid, despite the fact that what he now calls  entitlements  are what got him through college after his father s death, as he paid for his education with the survivor s benefits. Funny how people forget where they come from, isn t it?Oh, if only Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton were president. We might actually have some compassion at the top, instead of the sociopathic monstrosities who somehow pass for human beings that we have now.Featured image via Leigh Vogel/Getty Images",0

"21st Century Wire says Despite the mass media distraction of the improbably  Active Shooter  attack at Fort Lauderdale Airport earlier this afternoon   today was  the big day,  the dramatic release of the  unclassified  portion the US Intelligence report of the alleged Russian Hack  of the 2016 US Election. Meanwhile, at Trump Tower, President-Elect Donald Trump was given the full classified version of the report today, and was unimpressed, declaring that the alleged hacking of the Democrat National Committee (DNC) had  absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election. Note that it is still an  alleged  hack because US intelligence agencies Have yet to produce any actual evidence that the Russian government were involved in either the DNC Leaks or the Podesta Email dump on Wikileaks.Instead, the report s main thrust is accusing the Russians of running all of the so-called  fake news  articles that flooded Facebook and social media during the 2016 election cycle   claiming that it all traces back to St. Petersburg, Russia   despite earlier investigative reports published by both The Guardian and Buzzfeed which placed the fake news empire in Macedonia, where teenagers netted small fortunes by pumping out imaginary stories on hundreds of cut-out websites during the 2016 election.  Putin Aspired to Help Trump CNN and other US media outlets were quick to  down-shift  their headlines   away from saying that the Russian government  Hacked  the US Elections, now saying that  Putin Aspired to Help Trump. After a 90-minute briefing at Trump Tower with national intelligence chiefs,  Donald Trump, under pressure from his party and the US media, issued a statement seeming to acknowledge some hacking of  the cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee,  but was clear to ad the caveat that whatever happened had  absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election. While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines. There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the R.N.C. had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is running again for the job in the next Congress, a spokeswoman said on Thursday after a media report quoted several unidentified House Republicans as saying they expected him to step down next week. “He is running,” Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. The Hill cited four House Republicans as saying that they expected Ryan to step aside as Speaker after next Tuesday’s general election. “Speculation is growing that Paul will not return,” the Hill quoted a “senior GOP lawmaker close to leadership” as saying. It quoted a member of the Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans, as saying that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wins, Ryan will get “a good share of the blame” among House members who support Republican candidate Donald Trump. Ryan last month told fellow Republicans that he would not defend or campaign for Trump and would instead focus on re-electing Republicans to keep the majority in the House. This angered some Trump supporters in the House, who felt the Wisconsin congressman should stand by Trump. One of them, Representative Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma, tweeted: “if Paul Ryan isn’t for Trump, then I’m not for Paul Ryan.” But Ryan, who as Speaker is the country’s highest-ranking Republican, has a great deal of support in the Republican caucus, and it is far from clear that his critics would be able to oust him if they tried. House Republicans, who currently number 246, plan to have closed-door leadership elections in mid-November. Ryan is expected to win their nomination for Speaker at that gathering, but the actual election to the Speaker’s post would not be held until the new Congress convenes in January. All members of the House, both Republican and Democrat, will vote in the Speaker election and Ryan will need 218 votes - a majority of the House’s 435 members - to win. This could be a challenge if Republicans lose a substantial number of seats in next week’s elections, and if some of those who remain decide to oppose Ryan. ",1

The entire role of this brainwashing industry is to figure out how to spin information to journalists, similar to the lobbying of government. It is never really clear just how much truth the journalists receive because the news industry has become complacent. The messages that it presents are shaped by corporate powers who often spend millions on advertising with the six conglomerates that own 90% of the media:General Electric (GE), News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. Yet, these corporations function under many different brands, such as FOX, ABC, CNN, Comcast, Wall Street Journal, etc, giving people the perception of choice   As Tavistock s researchers showed, it was important that the victims of mass brainwashing not be aware that their environment was being controlled; there should thus be a vast number of sources for information, whose messages could be varied slightly, so as to mask the sense of external control. ~ Specialist of mass brainwashing, L. WolfeNew Brainwashing Tactic Called AstroturfWith alternative media on the rise, the propaganda machine continues to expand. Below is a video of Sharyl Attkisson, investigative reporter with CBS, during which she explains how  astroturf,  or fake grassroots movements, are used to spin information not only to influence journalists but to sway public opinion. Astroturf is a perversion of grassroots. Astroturf is when political, corporate or other special interests disguise themselves and publish blogs, start facebook and twitter accounts, publish ads, letters to the editor, or simply post comments online, to try to fool you into thinking an independent or grassroots movement is speaking. ~ Sharyl Attkisson, Investigative ReporterHow do you separate fact from fiction? Sharyl Attkisson finishes her talk with some insights on how to identify signs of propaganda and astroturfing  These methods are used to give people the impression that there is widespread support for an agenda, when, in reality, one may not exist. Astroturf tactics are also used to discredit or criticize those that disagree with certain agendas, using stereotypical names such as conspiracy theorist or quack. When in fact when someone dares to reveal the truth or questions the  official  story, it should spark a deeper curiosity and encourage further scrutiny of the information.This article (Journalist Reveals Tactics Brainwashing Industry Uses to Manipulate the Public) was originally created and published by Waking Times and is published here under a Creative Commons license with attribution to Vic Bishop and WakingTimes.com.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump s chief of staff said on Thursday that Washington believes Havana could put a halt to the mysterious incidents that have sickened nearly two dozen American diplomats and some tourists in Cuba.  We believe that the Cuban government could stop the attacks on our diplomats,  White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told reporters when asked about the situation at a White House briefing. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said later she thought Kelly was referring to the fact that the Vienna Conventions dealing with diplomatic relations between countries require the host nation to provide for the safety and security of diplomatic personnel. Nauert told a briefing at the State Department that the investigation into the attacks was  still under way  and the department did not know  who or what is responsible for it.  She also suggested the United States believes Cuba might know more than it has divulged about the incidents.  In a small country like Cuba where the government is going to know a lot of things that take place within its borders, they may have more information than we are aware of right now,  she said. The Trump administration last week expelled 15 Cuban diplomats to protest Havana s failure to protect staff at the U.S. embassy in the communist country. Washington also has recalled more than half its diplomatic personnel from Cuba. At least 22 U.S. diplomatic personnel have reported having health issues after being subjected to the apparent attacks. They have suffered hearing loss, dizziness, fatigue, cognitive problems and other health issues. The Associated Press obtained what it said on Thursday was an audio recording of the sound that Americans heard during the incidents in Cuba. The audio was of a high-pitched, electronic squeaking noise. ",1
"Just days after forsaking her Stanford Cardinals by supporting the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Rose Bowl to pander for votes, Carly Fiorina complained that Ted Cruz says  whatever  to get elected.During an interview on CNN, Fiorina launched an attack on the Texas Tea Party hero, who is currently leading in some Iowa polls ahead of the first primary vote in February. The failed former CEO of Hewlett-Packard whined about Cruz saying whatever it takes to get voters to support him. Ted Cruz is just like any other politician. He says one thing in Manhattan, he says another thing in Iowa. He says whatever he needs to say to get elected, and then he s going to do as he pleases. I think the American people are tired of the political class that promises much and delivers much of the same. But as right as she is about Ted Cruz, Fiorina completely ignored her own hypocrisy when it comes to pandering.For weeks, Fiorina pandered to conservative  Christians  by claiming that heavily edited Planned Parenthood videos featured footage of a live fetus being butchered for body parts. Fiorina s claims have since been thoroughly debunked by media and medical professionals.She has also pandered to women by falsely claiming that  92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama s first term belonged to women,  when in fact, women actually gained jobs.Fiorina also pandered to the military by accusing President Obama of ending the careers of several generals. However, only two of the five she mentioned retired due to policy differences with their commander-in-chief.Time and time again, Fiorina has lied in an effort to gain support. Politifact has caught her lying around 70 percent of the time.But her worst attempt to pander came on Friday when she wrote a Twitter post rooting for the Iowa Hawkeyes football team against her own alma mater in a clear effort to gain support from Iowa voters.Love my alma mater, but rooting for a Hawkeyes win today. #RoseBowl  Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) January 1, 2016CNN host Dana Bash also pointed out Fiorina s hypocrisy on Sunday, to which Fiorina responded by claiming that the tweet was just her way of having a little fun and was not meant to pander at all. For heaven s sake. Can t a girl ever have a little bit of fun?  Fiorina asked. That was a tongue in cheek tweet which the people of Iowa understand, because I was asked over and over again in Iowa, having attended a Hawkeye tailgate, I was asked, they knew that my heart was torn. Let s just say if the biggest mistake I make is a tongue in cheek Tweet about a Rose Bowl, the American people will sleep safely when I am President of the United States,  she added.  It was tongue in cheek, for heaven s sake. A girl needs to have a little fun sometimes. I guess it was a slow news day in the media. Here s the video via YouTube.However, contrary to what Fiorina claims, Iowa fans, nor anyone else for that matter, did not understand and were definitely not happy about Fiorina s tweet as she was roundly criticized in reply after reply to her tweet.Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, Fiorina s tweet is not the only mistake she has made throughout her campaign, nor is it the biggest. And it should also be noted that Fiorina played the woman card to spin out of her Twitter fiasco. Rather than own up to her obvious pandering play, Fiorina framed it as a girl just having fun and suggested that the media is being sexist.Sorry, Carly. But that just doesn t fly. You are currently polling at 2 percent in Iowa. Clearly, you are desperate for higher poll numbers as it becomes ever more clear that your campaign is doomed. So, you made a choice to pander to Iowans by throwing your own team under a bus instead of displaying loyalty to the university you graduated from. And then your decision was made worse after Stanford absolutely destroyed Iowa on the football field to win the Rose Bowl. If any other team had been playing the Hawkeyes, perhaps your tweet would have been appropriate, but that was not the case. You got caught pandering and now you re trying to frame it as a girl having a little fun and an evil sexist media attacking you for it. That s called playing the victim and it s not very appealing to voters either.Carly Fiorina should be so embarrassed right now that she ends her campaign in disgrace instead of continuing to pretend that people actually like her and that she has a chance to actually win.Featured Image: Flickr",0
"A White House press release which congratulated Exxon Mobil Corp. for its recent investment in U.S. manufacturing appears to be copied from a paragraph from the oil company s own release, CNN s Jake Tapper reported Monday.

The company s Growing the Gulf expansion program, consists of 11 major chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects at proposed new and existing facilities along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022. But it gets worse. Trump pretty much just gave a shout out to Exxon Mobil Corp. in an ad released on Twitter to his 26.1 million followers.There is an incredible spirit of optimism sweeping the country right now we're bringing back the JOBS! pic.twitter.com/BNSLvKiEVj  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 6, 2017After campaigning on  Drain the Swamp  as his tagline, Trump filled his cabinet up with terrifying swamp creatures such as secretary of state Rex Tillerson who previously served as the CEO of Exxon Mobil from 2006 to 2016. Tillerson had to leave his position with the company in order to go through the Senate confirmation process for the post.During his confirmation hearing, Tillerson said,  I have never lobbied against [Russian] sanctions personally,  Tillerson said.  To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.  That s not true, though.Trump campaigned on working for the middle class, those who possibly felt forgotten and shifted toward the back burner. Instead, he wants to lower tax rates on the wealthiest, eradicate Obamacare, rape the environment, ban Muslims from entering our borders (you can put pretty words on an executive order but it is what it is), and he s making a huge profit from his alleged presidency. Trump is in this for Trump and no one else. He d kick a puppy in the face if he and/or his billionaire buddies could profit from it.Image via screen capture. ",0
"Corey Lewandowski is still beating the Trump drum on CNN, including defending Trump s campaign shakeup this late in the game. There s just one tiny problem   he s doing so by comparing this shakeup to John Kerry s shakeup in 2004 and we all remember how that election turned out.The comments came just after now-former campaign chair Paul Manafort resigned from the campaign, which just strengthened all the talk that Trump is past the point of no return and cannot win this election no matter what he does. Lewandowski tried to counter that by saying: This campaign is not the first campaign to make staff changes. If you look at John Kerry s campaign, when he was running, he was making changes as late as Labor Day, and don t forget we re still in August  No, I understand, but the change in 2004 that John Kerry made helped him actually do significantly better than what he was doing. So? Kerry still lost. There is no getting around that fact. Kerry lost by about 3 million votes and 35 electoral votes. Yes, it was a close election, but really? He still lost and we still got four more years of George W. Bush. It s hard to imagine that anybody of Lewandowski s age and background doesn t see that.This is the kind of ignorance that s pervading Trump s campaign. Things have gotten so pathetically bad that there are people saying the polls don t matter because his social media followings are huge and attendance at his rallies is huge. Tens of millions don t attend his rallies, and it should be patently obvious that his social media following is very heavily biased.Lewandowski is a perfect Trump proxy with his head full of cotton. The main difference between him and those currently on Trump s staff is that the cotton filling their heads is a little more coarse.

"You remember that one company that used to stuff your mailbox full of coasters installation discs every single goddamn day of the week, your only reprieve from the madness being Sunday? Well, America Online finally discovered what it takes to be relevant: apparently Mike Pence uses it.On Thursday, the Indianapolis Star revealed that not only did the Vice President use private email   something for which Donald Trump s opponent, Hillary Clinton, was demonized   but he conducted state business on an insecure, almost-forgotten service that was presumed dead long ago. Unlike Hillary Clinton s private email server, Pence s AOL account was hacked.Clinton was spotted on a flight from Boston to New York on Friday and a passenger managed to catch the very moment the former Secretary of State saw the USA Today headline about Pence s private email. The passenger sent the photo to friends via Snapchat, and one of them saved it to share with the world:@jdawsey1 Hillary just checking the daily news. ""Pence used personal email in office."" The irony is palpable. pic.twitter.com/oia1ARiZ0g  Pere Noel (@RealSaintNick6) March 3, 2017The  what in the fuck?  look on Hillary s face is priceless. It s OK, we know what she s going through. We watched the Right froth at the mouth over what Ted Cruz would call a  nothingburger  if Clinton was a Republican for what seems like forever.It is not against the law to use a private email in Indiana, but officials are expected to retain the exchanges to fulfill public records requests. Documents released  via  a records request shows us that Pence discussed national security and other matters with his top advisors via his private email, but an unspecified number were withheld because   the state considers them confidential and too sensitive to release to the public. Once again, these are from an account that was hacked last summer. The Star notes that the scammer  sent an email to his contacts claiming Pence and his wife were stranded in the Philippines and in urgent need of money.  He responded not by increasing his security, but by creating a new AOL screen name.We will not be seeing calls to  LOCK HIM UP  from the Right, nor will we see GOP politicians calling for endless hearings and investigations. Normally, this would be fine but at this point there seems to be one set of rules for Democrats and one for Republicans in an administration that is easily outpacing even the accusations they leveled at Clinton.This photograph serves as a reminder of what Americans who knew better but decided that voting their  conscience  was more important than literally saving America from a despot and people who are too stupid to operate a fork without adult supervision yet figured out how to vote caused us to lose. We could have had a competent leader who isn t perfect, but she was at least smart enough to warn us about Donald Trump s cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin. And, of course, she isn t a walking human rights crisis.It s heartbreaking.Featured image via Twitter",0
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The House Republican health insurance plan suggests health insurance after Obamacare will be less affordable, investors, insurers and industry sources said on Tuesday, raising questions about future enrollment and insurance company participation. The draft legislation, released on Monday night, rolls back some of the key tenets of former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, known as Obamacare, including the individual mandate and the expansion of Medicaid. In addition to eliminating the requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance, it creates a system of new tax credits to coax people to purchase private insurance on the open market. The bill has the support of President Donald Trump, who has vowed to repeal and replace the 2010 law. But some Republican lawmakers whose support is needed for the final legislation - and Democrats - said they wanted details on how it would affect U.S. consumers.  Under the draft legislation, Obamacare’s income-based and location-based tax credits are replaced by credits with fixed amounts up to a maximum income level.  Because the bill has just been proposed and aims mostly to repeal the existing law rather than introduce new policies, it is unclear exactly how future changes could make the plan affordable and draw insurers into the market.  But some initial reaction, particularly from hospitals, was critical. The American Hospital Association said in a letter to Congress that it could not support the draft legislation in its current form. The BlueCross BlueShield Association, which represents BCBS insurers across the country that cover the vast majority of the about 10 million people enrolled in 2017 Obamacare plans, said the insurers were glad to see the extension of many Obamacare aspects into 2019. But it emphasized the need for the replacement to be affordable.      “It is important that the tax credit for 2020 creates a marketplace that enables people to get the coverage they need at a price they can afford,” BCBSA Senior Vice President Alissa Fox said in statement. The Association for Community Affiliated Plans, which represents health plans serving Medicaid for the poor and other public health programs, said it was concerned the structure would raise costs for people currently in the marketplace. Because insurance costs, healthcare costs and incomes vary so dramatically around the country, the new tax credit would affect some people more than others. “I think there’s a reasonable concern that people in high-cost states who are lower income will have a hard time finding affordable care,” said Paul Howard, director of health policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute. But the draft legislation also sets up a $100 billion fund over 10 years that states could use to structure subsidies for their members and offset some of that, he noted. Insurers have also asked to be able to offer plans with fewer benefits that could be sold at lower prices, Howard said. Since the draft removes the mandate requiring people to have insurance, the impact on enrollment from that measure is not clear. Standard & Poor’s estimated that the draft plan would reduce individual enrollment, now at around 10 million, by 2 to 4 million people. Steve Brozak, managing partner at WBB Securities, said he believed that under the Republican package, “people will be forgoing insurance.”  He also said that, as it is currently designed, insurers will have difficulty attracting people who do not have an immediate need for healthcare, like younger, healthy people who are less expensive to insure. Still, Brozak expects that this draft is only a first step and likely to change. It is expected to be voted on this month in the House before moving to the U.S. Senate.  The draft plan, along with Republicans’ proposed restructuring of the Medicaid program for the poor and the loud opposition from some Republican lawmakers, created uncertainty that drove down shares of hospitals and insurers. Republicans will need the buy-in from BlueCross BlueShield insurers like Anthem Inc, particularly after UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N) exited most of the states where they sold individual insurance plans under Obamacare.      Shares of hospital operators sold off, with Community Health Systems (CYH.N) down more than 8 percent and Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) off 7 percent.    Reaction in health insurer stocks was more subdued. Molina Healthcare (MOH.N) fell 1.3 percent and Cigna (CI.N) dropped 1 percent, while Humana (HUM.N) gained more than 2 percent and Anthem (ANTM.N) was little changed. The American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association, which represents doctors, declined to comment on the draft legislation. Support for government-run health insurance has risen over the past five years, according to the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll.  Between February and March, 47 percent of Americans said the government should have at least a “major role” in providing health insurance. That was up from 39 percent who answered the same way when the poll first asked the question in January 2012. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The latest poll ran from Feb. 25 to March 6 and included responses from more than 2,700 American adults. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.  polling.reuters.com/#poll/PV4/dates/20170225-20170306/type/overall ",1
"After White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer decided he would say Adolf Hitler wasn t as bad as Syrian President Assad,  as well as claim that Hitler never gassed his people, many people were outraged, and justifiably so.Either Spicer is an absolute moron, or he truly doesn t believe the atrocities that were committed by Nazi Germany to their own people, primarily those who were Jewish, and the people of neighboring regions.Offering to basically be Spicer s tutor on the Holocaust because he is so clearly a moron, the Anti-Defamation League s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt wrote the press secretary a letter.Here s the letter in full: Dear Mr. Spicer:This week Jews around the world have spent time with their families celebrating Passover, the feast of freedom. In the Passover liturgy, we read that in each generation there will be those who rise up to harm the Jewish people, much like Pharaoh in ancient times and Hitler in modern times. Understanding and being keenly aware of our history   to  never forget    is part of Passover and part of the Jewish experience.Unfortunately, when the first days of Passover ended and we turned on our phones and televisions yesterday evening, we learned about your comment that Hitler did not gas his own people. Your comparisons between Assad and Hitler were not only historically inaccurate but they also were inappropriate and offensive.While you have apologized, this week s incident as well as others (notably, the International Holocaust Remembrance Day statement omitting Jews and your vociferous defense of it), have exposed a serious gap in your knowledge of the Holocaust, its impact, and the lessons we can learn from it.For decades, ADL has been at the forefront of Holocaust education, providing trainings about the Nazi atrocities to a wide range of groups. We have conducted trainings for more than 130,000 law enforcement professionals and more than 35,447 educators, reaching more than 1,000,000 students. Our programs provide historical context for how the Holocaust was able to occur; teach the Holocaust as a human story; and create opportunities for critical thinking. Each of these educational programs focuses on the consequences of unchecked bigotry and hate.ADL would be happy to conduct one of these trainings at your convenience for you, your staff, and anyone at the White House who may need to learn more about the Holocaust. We know you are very busy, but we believe a few hours learning this history will help you understand where you went wrong and prevent you from making these mistakes in the future.Sincerely,Jonathan A. Greenblatt CEO Anti-Defamation League Hopefully, Spicer takes the ADL up on their offer and gets the education he so clearly needs. In addition, he still needs to be fired.Featured Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images",0

"Whenever big news happens in Washington, the nation (at least those in desperate need of entertainment) awaits the response of just one man: Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas). Gohmert almost never disappoints with the depth of his stupidity and he certainly didn t on Thursday, when he yelled at the Democratic Congresspeople who were conducting a sit-in in support of gun control.The sit-in lasted a bit over 24 hours, and it was in protest to the four failed attempts at gun control in the Senate and of Speaker Paul Ryan s (R-Wisconsin) refusal to even let a gun control measure get a debate or vote.Gohmert, who received more than $13,000 in contributions from the National Rifle Association, thought the Congresspeople were protesting the wrong thing. According to him, Islam is responsible for our country s mass shootings. We are talking about radical Islam!  Gohmert yelled, waving his finger at posters featuring photos of the victims of the recent mass shooting at an Orlando, Florida gay club.  Radical Islam killed these people! Gohmert was shouted down by Democrats chanting,  No fly, no gun!  and  Don t let terrorists have a gun! Source: Talking Points MemoSure, we can call our gun problem a terrorism problem. G-d knows it s terrifying Americans, but it s not a Muslim problem. The vast majority of mass shooters are white men without a political agenda.  As we learn more and more about the Orlando shooter, we are coming to realize that his association to terrorism is sketchy at best. Instead, it seems, he was a spurned self-hating gay man.If that s the case, that he is a self-loathing gay man and that s all the shooting was about, that indicates a societal problem   one which Gohmert, a man who seems to obsess over whether being gay is God s will   is at least partially responsible for. The bigger picture, though, is that all of our mass shootings, as a matter of fact, all of our nation s shootings period, have one thing in common and that s guns. In our current political climate, there isn t a chance in hell that people will give up all guns, but there s a chance, albeit a slim one, that maybe we could stop the sale of assault weapons to violent people. That s all Congress wants.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla at Getty Images.",0
"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria s armed forces said on Friday a group campaigning for the secession of a part of southeastern Nigeria formerly known as Biafra had been categorized as a  terrorist organization . The move follows days of tension in which members of the group accused the army of laying siege to their leader s home, which the army denied. A curfew was imposed in Abia state where the residence is located.  The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group has stepped up calls for secession since its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, was released on bail in April after being detained nearly two years on charges of criminal conspiracy and belonging to an illegal society. Secessionist sentiment has simmered in the region since the Biafra separatist rebellion plunged Africa s most populous country into a civil war in 1967-70 that killed an estimated one million people. The military presence in southeastern Nigeria has increased in the last few weeks as part of an operation that the military said was part of efforts to crack down on crime.  The Armed Forces of Nigeria wishes to confirm to the general public that IPOB from all intent, plan and purpose as analyzed, is a militant terrorist organization,  said armed forces spokesman John Enenche in an emailed statement.  The statement said IPOB had formed a  Biafra secret service  a paramilitary division, extorted money from people on public roads and attacked members of the armed forces.  An IPOB spokesman was not immediately available for comment.  The tension is another security challenge for President Muhammadu Buhari in addition to the eight-year Boko Haram jihadist insurgency in the northeast and attempts to maintain a fragile ceasefire in the southern Niger Delta energy hub. Militant attacks on oil facilities in the Niger Delta last year cut crude production by more than a third. Renewed calls for Biafran secession prompted Buhari to use his first speech after returning from three months of medical leave in Britain in August to say Nigeria s unity was  not negotiable .  Amid mounting tensions in the region, the army on Thursday said it was investigating video footage circulating on social media that purportedly showed troops at a checkpoint in Abia  using sticks to flog men stripped to the waist and forcing them to drink muddy water. Amnesty International in 2016 accused Nigeria s security forces of killing at least 150 Biafra separatists at peaceful rallies. The military and police denied the allegations.

"Donald Trump has access to a wealth of information as President, but seems content relying on Breitbart and other slimy right-wing propaganda mills as the sole source of what he thinks are facts.

To clear up the confusion, CNN s Jake Tapper reached out to Trump administration officials, and it turns out that, yes, the situation is just as stupid as it seems. Donald Trump did get his  news  from Breitbart, not the wealth of government information to which he has access.

WH call for Congress to find evidence of POTUS claim with  no further comment  is not proof,  Tapper says, adding that he has requested an interview with President Obama to clear the matter up (which totally needs to happen and promises to be hilarious).Journalists are not alone in being baffled by Trump s ridiculous claim that the former President ordered a wiretap which, once again, he could not do. On Sunday, vocal Obama opponent Marco Rubio said he has no idea where Trump s claim comes from either. I m not sure what it is he is talking about,  Rubio says.  Perhaps the President has information that is not yet available to us or to the public. And if it s true, obviously we re going to find out very quickly. And if it isn t, then obviously he ll have to explain what he meant by it. Unfortunately, as Tapper notes, the information wasn t a closely-held government secret. It was the result of the ravings of a known far-Right conspiracy theorist who has admitted he doesn t even have the evidence to back his claims; he just wants to see Obama investigated.President Obama should do the interview. He s so past the point of caring what these idiots think that it should be hilarious.Featured image via Getty Images",0
"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Thursday welcomed a United Nations report and a U.S. stand on Iran s missile supplies to Yemen s Houthis and demanded immediate action to hold Tehran accountable for its actions, state news agency SPA reported.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia welcomes the U.N. report that asserted that the hostile Iranian intervention and its support for the terrorist Houthi militia with advanced and dangerous missile capabilities threatens the security and stability of the kingdom and the region,  SPA said. The agency said Saudi Arabia also welcomed the U.S. position  announced by Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who presented pieces of what she said were Iranian weapons supplied to the Iran-aligned Houthi and described them as conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions. SPA said the evidence, which emerged after the Houthis fired a missile toward the capital Riyadh last month, was proof of violations of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 2216 and 2231 on Yemen, and 1559 and 1701, which relate to Lebanon.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia demands the international community to take immediate measures to implement the aforementioned Security Council resolutions and to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its hostile actions,  it said. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis through ports used to deliver humanitarian aid and food shipments to Yemen.

At some point, investors would begin to doubt the government s willingness or ability to meet its debt obligations, requiring it to pay much higher interest costs in order to continue borrowing money. Such a fiscal crisis would present policymakers with extremely difficult choices and would probably have a substantial negative impact on the country.  ",0
"Crains Chicago Business   American democracy is fragile, and unless care is taken it could follow the path of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.Mixed in with many softer comments, that was the somewhat jaw-dropping bottom line of Barack Obama last night as, in a Q&A session before the Economic Club of Chicago, the Chicagoan who used to be president dropped a bit of red meat to a hometown crowd that likely is a lot closer to him than the man whose name never was mentioned: President Donald Trump.Obama s comments came after a series of playful questions from moderator and Ariel Investments President Mellody Hobson in the great Batman vs. Superman debate, for instance, we learned Obama sides with Batman before she eventually asked him what he s learned as a world citizen of sorts.One thing he s learned is that  things don t happen internationally if we don t put our shoulder to the wheel,  Obama said, speaking of the U.S.  No other country has the experience and bandwith and ideals. . . .If the U.S. doesn t do it, it s not going to happen. Obama gave one specific example, but it was a solid one: Ebola. To fight the virus the U.S. did everything from build an airport tarmac in Africa to send in medical teams and ferry medicos from other countries.  We probably saved a million lives by doing that,  he said.At least indirectly, those comments could be seen as criticism of Trump, whose foreign policy focuses on an  America first  paradigm that critics say distracts from this country s unique role.Obama moved from that to talking about a nativist mistrust and unease that has swept around the world. He argued that such things as the speed of technical change and the uneven impact of globalization have come too quickly to be absorbed in many cultures, bringing strange new things and people to areas in which  people didn t (used to) challenge your assumptions.  As a result,  nothing feels solid,  he said.  Sadly, there s something in us that looks for simple answers when we re agitated. Still, the U.S. has survived tough times before and will again, he noted, particularly mentioning the days of communist fighter Joseph McCarthy and former President Richard Nixon. But one reason the country survived is because it had a free press to ask questions, Obama added. Though he has problems with the media just like Trump has had,  what I understood was the principle that the free press was vital. The danger is  grow(ing) complacent,  Obama said.  We have to tend to this garden of democracy or else things could fall apart quickly. That s what happened in Germany in the 1930s which, despite the democracy of the Weimar Republic and centuries of high-level cultural and scientific achievements, Adolph Hitler rose to dominate, Obama noted.  Sixty million people died. . . .So, you ve got to pay attention. And vote. ",0
"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told Iraq s U.S.-backed prime minister on Thursday that he should not rely on the United States in the fight against Islamic State, seeking to drive a wedge between Washington and one of its close allies.  Unity was the most important factor in your gains against terrorists and their supporters,  Khamenei told the visiting Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, according to state TV.  Don t trust America ... It will harm you in the future.  Iraq is one of the only countries in the world that is closely allied to both the United States and Iran. Both countries have armed and trained pro-government forces in Iraq in the battle against Islamic State militants. The United States, which installed the Shi ite-led government in Baghdad after toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003, now has 5,000 troops in Iraq and provides air support, training and weapons to the Iraqi army. Iran, the predominant Shi ite power in the Middle East, funds and trains Iraqi Shi ite paramilitaries known as Popular Mobilisation, which fight alongside government troops. For years, Baghdad has carefully avoided antagonising either Washington or Tehran. But a confrontation between the Iraqi central government and its Kurdish minority in recent weeks has threatened to tip the balance in Iran s favour. The Kurds are also funded and trained by Washington which has considered them allies for decades. After the Kurds staged a referendum on independence last month, Abadi responded by sending his troops to swiftly seize territory from Kurdish forces. This week, Abadi rebuked U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for demanding he send Iranian fighters in pro-government Shi ite militia  home . Abadi s office issued a statement saying no country should give orders to Iraq and calling the paramilitaries  patriots . He has since travelled to both Turkey and Iran to seek support for his hard line towards the Kurds. The Kurdish regional government proposed on Wednesday an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the result of last month s Kurdish independence vote and  starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution . The offer was rejected by Abadi s government, which said the independence referendum result must be annulled, rather than merely suspended, as a pre-condition to any talks.  We will preserve Iraq s unity and will never allow any secession,  Iran s state news agency IRNA quoted Abadi as saying during his meeting with Khamenei. ",1
"(Reuters) - A “lone hacker” has taken responsibility for a cyber attack on the U.S. Democratic National Committee, which the DNC and a cyber-security firm have blamed on the Russian government. The DNC and cyber firm CrowdStrike disclosed the attack on Tuesday, saying that hackers working for Russia broke into the DNC’s computer network, spied on internal communications and stole research on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. A Russian government spokesman responded by saying that Moscow had not been involved. On Wednesday, an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 took responsibility for the attack in a post on the blogging site WordPress.com, saying the DNC was “hacked by a lone hacker.” The DNC did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday evening on Guccifer 2.0’s claim. CrowdStrike said it stands by findings that the Russian government was behind the attacks.  Guccifer 2.0’s blog includes images of documents it claims were stolen from DNC servers, including one titled “Donald Trump Report,” which was dated Dec. 19, and spreadsheets purportedly containing information about party donors.  Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the documents, which the blog said were among “thousands of files and mails” removed from DNC servers that would soon be published on WikiLeaks.  CrowdStrike issued a statement saying it “stands fully by its analysis” that two groups affiliated with Russian intelligence were discovered in the DNC’s network last month.  The company said it was reviewing the documents published by Guccifer 2.0 to determine whether they were authentic.  ",1

On Sunday, agents caught a group of seven illegal aliens near the river and when they took them to the station for processing learned that one of them identified as Walter Leonel Vasquez Zacarias was a violent sexual predator, court records obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed.Court records revealed that Vasquez Zacarias had been convicted of  aggravated sexual battery victim under 13 years of age  in March 20, 2009. For that offense, Vasquez was initially arrested on June 16, 2008 in Augusta County, Virginia and after his conviction was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but for unknown reasons, eight years from his sentence were suspended and he was deported in March 30, 2010 through Houston.Vasquez continues to be listed in various search engines as a violent sexual predator.In recent days, agents arrested four other criminal aliens with a sexually based criminal history, information provided to Breitbart Texas by Border Patrol revealed. One of the aliens was from Guatemala and he had a previous conviction for aggravated sexual battery of a victim under the age of 13. Another of the aliens was also from Guatemala and he had a conviction for aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Two other aliens from Mexico had convictions for indecent liberties with a child and the other for sexual assault. Border Patrol agents remain vigilant in their efforts to protect this nation from all threats including predators and convicted criminals attempting to illegally enter the country,  said Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla Jr. in a prepared statement.

"When it comes to political campaign strategies, Donald Trump clearly believes he can hate and insult his way into the Oval Office. So far, it s working in the Republican primary, because let s face it, the GOP has become a party of hateful rhetoric and building up fear of anyone other than those who look and act exactly as they do (predominantly white, heterosexual,  Christian,  etc.). However, that strategy, most likely, will not work in the general election, because the rest of America sees Trump as the ridiculous mudslinger that he actually is.Pointing this out in a pretty hilarious way was none other than Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. She, or her campaign staff with her approval, took to Twitter to put Trump on blast about his hateful tone and rhetoric. After all, Trump is already pivoting to the general and referring to Clinton as  Crooked Hillary.  It s a technique he s been using in the primaries against his Republican opposition, so he figures he should try it out for the general as well.What did Hillary tweet out? A Washington Post article highlighting pretty much every hateful and disparaging thing Trump has said throughout his campaign, with every paragraph beginning,  Remember when  Yet, she introduced the article on Twitter by hilariously mocking the way Trump tweets. All too often you ll see Trump tweet something out, and it will be followed with a one word sentence    Sad!

"Barack Obama and the Democrat Party were laser focused on opening the immigrant floodgates for 8 years. They re the first ones to cry when President Trump mentions budget cuts to schools and programs for the elderly, but what about the enormous burden millions of new immigrants (mostly illegal) have put on the backs of taxpayers? The Democrats were only looking at immigrants as voters, they didn t consider how the massive influx of people on entitlement programs would affect our schools and social programs. The statistics below are stunning:Children of immigrants, many in the United States illegally, make up the bulk of students in 700 of the biggest school areas, a huge and unexpected wave that is changing education and society in America, according to a groundbreaking new report.Using Census Bureau statistics and Google Maps, the Center for Immigration Studies found that in areas including northern Virginia, New York City and Houston, children of immigrants made up to 93 percent of all students. The number of children from immigrant households in schools is now so high in some areas that it raises profound questions about assimilation,  said the report provided to Secrets. What s more, immigration has added enormously to the number of public school students who are in poverty and the number who speak a foreign language. This cannot help but to create significant challenges for schools, often in areas already struggling to educate students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds,  it added.Overall, 23 percent of all public school students were from an immigrant household in 2015. In 1990 it was 11 percent, and in 1980 it was 7 percent.And, said the CIS report,  between one-fourth and one-third of public school students from immigrant households were the children of illegal immigrants. Report author Steven Camarota said,  Of course, we must educate the children of immigrants.  But, added the Center s director of research,  the key question moving forward is whether it makes sense to continue to admit 1 million new legal permanent immigrants each year and tolerating illegal immigration without regard to the absorption capacity of our schools in terms of both educating students and assimilating them. On a state level, he found that California has the biggest percentage of immigrant students in public schools, 48 percent, followed by Nevada, 35 percent, New Jersey and New York at 34 percent, and Texas, 31 percent.The bulk have Mexican or El Salvadoran parents.He also found that many immigrant families are poor, which cuts the tax base schools have to tap for funds.For entire story: Washington Examiner",0

"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz will hold coalition talks with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), both sides said on Tuesday, bringing the anti-immigration party a step closer to power, which it last held more than a decade ago. Having won last week s parliamentary election with 31.5 percent of the vote, Kurz s party is far short of a majority, needing a partner to gain control of parliament and form a stable government. Only two parties have enough seats to do that with   the Social Democrats (SPO) and the FPO. Kurz, 31, took a hard line on immigration in the campaign that left little space between him and the FPO, and both parties capitalized on a widespread feeling that the country had been overrun during Europe s migration crisis in 2015 and 2016. He called for an end to the current coalition with the SPO when he took over as leader of the People s Party (OVP) in May, arguing in favor of a break with Austria s tradition of often deadlocked centrist coalitions. That left the FPO, a party founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, a more willing partner.  I have therefore decided to invite (FPO leader) Heinz-Christian Strache and the FPO today to take part in coalition talks,  Kurz told a news conference. Strache soon accepted, saying teams from both parties would meet on Wednesday but adding that the FPO would not strike a deal at any cost.  Being part of the government is not an end in itself and only makes sense if we can implement our correct and important policies,  Strache told a news conference.  Therefore no one should think that we will make it easy for the OVP.  Some European leaders have expressed concern about the possible return to power of the FPO, which first became a major force in the 1990s under the late Joerg Haider, who praised Hitler s employment policies.  The party has steadily increased its mainstream appeal in recent years. It says it has turned its back on its Nazi past, though it still frequently has to expel members for anti-Semitic statements. It has also dropped calls for Austria to leave the European Union as most Austrians back membership.  Kurz has sought to allay such concerns and repeated on Tuesday that any government must have a  clear pro-European orientation , though he also wants a streamlined EU that focuses on core tasks like trade and protecting external borders.  Strache said he backed that view of Europe, the fourth of five scenarios for the future of the bloc laid out by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in March, which Strache called  less but better .  Strache and Kurz on Tuesday both emphasized the importance of cutting taxes. Both believe in restricting benefits for foreigners and making the state more efficient, but the FPO also wants to increase some benefits like the minimum state pension.  In terms of content there are some things that unite us and others that divide us,  Kurz said in a typically vague answer on his expectations of a deal. He hopes to have an agreement by Christmas. The FPO has made control of the Interior Ministry a condition for any deal, but it did not mention that on Tuesday. The OVP and FPO went into government together in 2000, which prompted the rest of the EU to impose short-lived sanctions on Austria over the FPO s accession to power. Given the more guarded response to Austria s election in the aftermath of the migration crisis and the rise of other right-wing parties like France s National Front and the Alliance for Germany, a new tie-up between them is unlikely to provoke the same outrage.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators said on Sunday the White House has not been forthcoming with details about the military s presence in Niger after the deaths of four soldiers there earlier this month and they want more answers on U.S. operations in the west African country. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said in separate interviews that they support Republican Senator John McCain s effort to get answers from the Pentagon on the ambush and more broadly on the U.S. fight against ISIS in Niger. Graham and Schumer said they had been unaware of the large U.S. presence in the country and said Congress needs more information on what could become a long and open-ended involvement.  I didn t know there was 1,000 troops in Niger,  Graham said on NBC s Meet the Press.  This is an endless war without boundaries and no limitation on time and geography,  he added.  You ve got to tell us more and he [McCain] is right to say that.  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told Graham and McCain, who serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Friday that the military is shifting its counter-terrorism strategy to focus more on Africa and expanding the ability to use force against suspected terrorists. The attack earlier this month, which U.S. officials suspect was carried out by a local Islamic State affiliate, has thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counter-terrorism mission in Niger, which has about 800 U.S. troops. U.S. President Donald Trump drew attention to the ambush after sparring last week with Democratic Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, who criticized the president for what she said were insensitive remarks to the widow of one of the fallen soldiers. Democrat Schumer said on the same program on Sunday that he, like Graham, had also been unaware of the large presence of U.S. troops in Niger and is also awaiting more answers from the military this week. He said Congress may need to re-examine the current authorization for what he said could be a long, open-ended involvement in the country and region.  We need to look at this carefully. This is a brave new world. There are no set battle plans,  he said, adding that Congress currently authorizes action as part of the authorization of military use that has been in place for 16 years since the September 11 terror attacks on the United States.  I would be for re-examining this. There is no easy answer but we need to look at it. The answer we have now is not adequate,  he said. ",1
"It s kind of poetic: Russian help and Trump s tweets are largely what propelled him to the White House, and those two things may also bring about his downfall.On news that Trump s son, Donald Jr., scheduled a meeting during the campaign with a Russian lawyer promising  dirt  on Hillary Clinton, the microscope on Trump s shady campaign only intensified. He s tried everything to get it to stop, including firing the FBI director investigating him, but it s all starting to come out.Making matters worse for the White House, Donald Jr. keeps digging himself a deeper hole. First, he tried to cover up the meeting. Then when he got caught, he lied about the contents of the meeting. Then when he got caught again, he admitted, with no apparent awareness, that, yes, he had tried to collude with the Russians, but since he failed it wasn t wrong. (Note: hiring a hitman to kill your wife is a crime whether the hitman goes through with it or not.)On Monday, following a weekend of collusion evidence against him, Donald Jr. again brought out his gold-plated shovel and started digging.Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent  went nowhere but had to listen. https://t.co/ccUjL1KDEa  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017For what it s worth, staffers from other campaigns, both Republican and Democratic, have gone on record to say that there is a flat policy in election teams of handing over any information about an opponent seemingly obtained illegally or from a foreign adversary to law enforcement.

"As President Obama rolls out executive orders to strengthen background checks to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, two New York lawmakers are being threatened by the NRA for introducing legislation to restrict the sale of ammunition.The bill would limit the amount of ammo a person can purchase over a 90-day stretch and would ban gun dealers from selling ammunition to people who are prohibited from buying guns.The NRA, of course, is not happy about the legislation sponsored by state Senator Roxanne Persaud and Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon.But rather than simply protest, the thugs over at the National Rifle Association decided to pull a Sarah Palin and make targets of the pair of Democrats.In a Twitter post by NRA publication  America s 1st Freedom,  pictures of both lawmakers are taped to a board as if someone is preparing to use their images for target practice. To make it even more threatening, bullets are scattered next to the pictures in what appears to be an attempt to incite gun violence against them. Underneath the image, the NRA whines that the measure is a  ridiculous anti-gun scheme. Here s a screenshot of the tweet.The image comes nearly five years to the day a congresswoman was forced to leave office after being attacked by a deranged shooter.As you ll recall, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was nearly assassinated by a gunman after Sarah Palin posted a map on Facebook with crosshair symbols denoting which lawmakers conservatives should target because of their support of gun control. The map, which still exists on Palin s Facebook page, served as a  hit list  and caused national outrage. Giffords survived despite being shot in the head, but the NRA seems to be hoping for a repeat.Persaud and Simon blasted the image as an attempt to intimidate and threaten them into bowing down to gun nuts. I think it is irresponsible in the times that we are living in to place a target around someone,  Persaud told the Daily News.  By placing someone s picture with bullets next to them, you are playing on the fears of people. The New York Daily News reports:Persaud said the picture has  the potential to cause harm  because you don t know if a psycho who is upset about the proposal will react to something like that.Simon slammed the tweet for inciting gun nuts, who have been sending threats to both lawmakers since they proposed the legislation last month. They are clearly trying to be intimidating and it is not working,  she said.The Daily News also reports that NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams condemned the tweet as well.Once again, the NRA is acting like the terrorist organization it has become over the years. Even a veiled threat against lawmakers is outrageous and should not be tolerated in this country. If a gun nut does end up taking a shot at Persaud or Simon, the blame should be placed squarely on the NRA.Featured Image: Raw Story",0

"When will the libs start Delta Smelt shaming and demand answers from the left for putting a fish before the lives and livelihood of so many TV cop Tom Selleck may or may not have improperly swiped precious water by the magnum, but he didn t commit a crime, real California cops told NBC News on Wednesday.Selleck, the 70-year-old star of  Blue Bloods  and formerly of  Magnum, P.I.,  and his wife, Jillie, were sued this week by the Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County for allegedly sending a water tender   like the giant tanker trucks used to supply fire engines   to siphon off tankloads of water from a public hydrant at a construction site at least 12 times over the last two years.The water district said in its suit that it hired a real private investigator who several times observed the same water tender leave the 61-acre ranch the fictional P.I. owns in the ritzy Hidden Valley area of Ventura County, which is in a different water district and was assessed last year at more than $10 million (and was once owned by Dean Martin).The suit says the water district sent cease-and-desist letters to Selleck after its investigator spotted the truck at the hydrant eight times the week of Sept. 29, 2013.But the truck showed up again in December of that year, and was tracked as it proceeded to Selleck s property, according to the suit.Then, on four straight days just last March, the same truck again drained tankloads of water from the construction site and delivered it to the Selleck ranch, the suit says. The suit seeks an order forcing Selleck to stop using the district s water, plus reimbursement for the $21,685.55 it paid the investigator, with damages and other costs.But the suit is a civil action, not a criminal case. Ventura County sheriff s Capt. John Riley meanwhile told NBC News that the sheriff s office did investigate allegations of criminal water theft, but  we are unable to establish a crime was committed. The Ventura County district attorney s office also confirmed that no case has been referred to it for prosecution.Selleck hasn t responded to requests for comment, and it s unknown whether he has anything to do with the water truck, which is registered under a commercial license.Eric Bergh, the water district s manager of resources, said the suit wasn t meant to be an example of  drought shaming,  a peculiarly California activity in which people suspected of hogging water are publicly called out. Our policies have been on the books for decades,  Bergh said.  We just want any such activity to stop   that is the bottom line for us. It s really about doing the right thing and preserving our water supply for our users. Via: CNBC",0
"In a rare display of bipartisanship, nearly every member of the U.S. Congress voted in a favor of a monumental mental health reform package. The legislation, which was designed to address current gaps in mental health services, such as a lack of qualified staff and a shortage of beds for patients in crisis, will now head to the Senate for approval.According to the non-profit organization Mental Health America more than 57 percent of people who are impacted by mental illness have not received treatment within the past year. On top of that, mental health facilities across the country report a lack of beds for patients in crisis. It s estimated that at least 100,000 beds would be needed to effectively address the needs of all patients.While Congress did not go that far, the legislation does increase funding for additional hospital beds. It also expands access to local mental health services, including treatment by a qualified psychiatrist. In addition, the bill provides for Medicaid to conditionally cover mental health services. It also allows parents of seriously mentally ill adults to access their son or daughter s medical records and treatment plans.According to NBC, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which was created to oversee the nation s mental health system, does not employ a single Psychiatrist. The legislation addresses this problem by providing funding for the agency to hire qualified staff. It also creates a new position,  Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders,  to head up SAMHSA. The person selected to hold the position must be a psychiatrist or psychologist.While mental health advocates say they would have liked the bill to go farther, most believe it would be a positive first step toward reforming America s failing mental health system.As NBC reports here, the bill is the most comprehensive mental health system reform package since the early 1960 s. The Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act (H.R. 2646) passed the House on July 6, with 422 representatives voting in favor and only two voting against. According to govtrack.us, the bill now has a 27 percent chance of being signed into law.Featured image via wikipedia public domain",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opposes a long-planned transition of oversight of the internet’s technical management from the U.S. government to a global community of stakeholders, his campaign said in a statement on Wednesday. Congress should block the handover, scheduled to occur on Oct. 1, “or internet freedom will be lost for good, since there will be no way to make it great again once it is lost,” Stephen Miller, national policy director for the Trump campaign, said in a statement. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a former presidential primary foe of Trump’s who has refused to endorse the real estate developer, has led a movement in Congress to block the transition, arguing it could cede control of the internet itself to authoritarian regimes like Russia and China and threaten online freedom. Technical experts have said those claims are baseless, and that a delay will backfire by undermining U.S. credibility in future international negotiations over internet standards and security. Publicly proposed in March 2014, the transfer of oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is expected to go forward unless Congress votes to block the move.  A vote to delay the transition may come as an amendment to a temporary spending bill that Congress must pass by Sept. 30 to prevent much of the federal government from shutting down. Congressional negotiators on Wednesday were working to finalize an agreement on the spending package. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton supports the Obama administration’s planned transition to a global community of technologists, civil society groups and internet users, according to policy positions available on her campaign website.

"Ask your liberal friends to tell you more about these  poor women and children  who are fleeing persecution from radical Islamists in the Middle East The recent surge of migration into Europe has been unprecedented in scope, with an estimated 1 million migrants from the Middle East and North Africa this past year alone, making for a massive humanitarian crisis, as well as a political and moral dilemma for European governments. But one crucial dimension of this crisis has gone little-noticed: sex or, more technically, sex ratios.According to official counts, a disproportionate number of these migrants are young, unmarried, unaccompanied males. In fact, the sex ratios among migrants are so one-sided we re talking worse than those in China, in some cases that they could radically change the gender balance in European countries in certain age cohorts.  PoliticoA leaked German government report has warned, that up to 6.6 million people are waiting in countries around the Mediterranean to cross into Europe, according to details of the classified report leaked to Bild newspaper.Here s a video that s being circulated on social media today, of a boatload of young, male immigrants who are speaking Arabic as they record their trip on a smartphone.

That might sound sexist on the surface, but years of research has shown that male-dominated societies are less stable, because they are more susceptible to higher levels of violence, insurgence and mistreatment of women. In Germany, scores of women recently reported being attacked on New Year s Eve by men whom the authorities describe as of  North African or Arabic  descent. While it is not yet known whether the alleged perpetrators were migrants, the attacks may finally be alerting policymakers to the risks of a male-dominated migration wave.Why would European societies, many of which rank highest on global measures of gender equality and stability and peace, jeopardize those hard-won and enviable rankings?That imbalance might not sound radical, but it is, especially when you look more closely at who those males are. It s true that many male migrants hope that, if granted asylum, they will be joined in Europe by their wives and children, who would help balance out national sex ratios. But importantly, more than 20 percent of migrants are minors below the age of 18, and the IOM estimates that more than half of those minors traveling to Europe are traveling as unaccompanied minors 90 percent of whom are males. This heavily male subset is all but guaranteed asylum because of their status as unaccompanied minors, but they get no special dispensation to bring spouses, especially since the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that European Union countries are not required to recognize the legality of child marriages among migrants.

"BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s Foreign Minister said on Monday that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s comments that NATO was obsolete had aroused concern across the 28-member alliance. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, speaking after a meeting with alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels, said Trump’s remarks contradicted views expressed by designated Defense Secretary James Mattis. He spoke also of “amazement”. “I’ve spoken today not only with EU foreign ministers but NATO foreign ministers as well and can report that the signals are that there’s been no easing of tensions,” Steinmeier told reporters when asked about Trump’s interview with Bild newspaper and the Times of London. “Obviously the comments from President-elect Trump, that he views NATO as obsolete, were viewed with anxiety,” he said. Trump, who is due to be sworn in as president on Friday, said NATO was obsolete because it had not defended against terrorist attacks.  He said also he had always had “great respect” for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, but criticized her 2015 decision to allow in a wave of a million migrants as a “catastrophic mistake” that opened the door to terrorist attacks. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said it was “inappropriate” for Trump to weigh directly into the politics of another country by his remarks. “He will have to speak to that, as of Friday he is responsible for that relationship.” NATO has been seen since the 1950s as the keystone of western European defenses, extending its zone of activity in the post-Cold War period to the borders of Russia - much to Russia’s chagrin. The alliance’s founding treaty commits members to consider an attack on any one state as an attack on all. A Kremlin spokesman said he agreed with Trump that NATO, characterized by Russian officials as a hostile remnant of the Cold War, was obsolete. Germany’s transatlantic coordinator, Juergen Hardt, told Reuters he did not expect Congress to allow Washington to give up its leadership role in NATO. He said key U.S. lawmakers, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, had told him several weeks ago they expected Washington to remain a reliable partner in the 28-nation bloc, and he did not expect Trump to reverse the deployment of 4,000 U.S. troops to Poland. Norbert Roettgen, head of Germany’s foreign affairs committee, said Germany should fight to restore Western unity. “Europe is not able to replace the security role of the United States so there is a lot at stake - the very foundations of liberal order internationally and European security. And for that we should fight because it is our very existential interest,” Roettgen told Reuters. Trump repeated criticism of NATO members that fail to meet spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. Germany is working to gradually boost its military spending, Defence Ministry spokesman Jens Flosdorff told a news conference. Merkel in November said she could not promise the NATO target would be met “in the near future.” ",1
"After an anti-LGBT witness demonstrated her ignorance of transgender people, a House Democrat openly called her a bigot for the record.During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Gail Heriot of the U.S. Human Rights Commission made it pretty clear that she probably should not be part of that body when she testified in writing that transgender people are living in a fantasy world where they are only pretending to be members of the opposite sex. If I believe that I am a Russian princess, that doesn t make me a Russian princess, even if my friends and acquaintances are willing to indulge my fantasy,  Heriot wrote.  Nor am I a Great Horned Owl just because   as I have been told   I happen to share some personality traits with those feathered creatures. Republicans are currently waging war against the federal government s public bathroom policy that protects transgender people from discrimination, which was a response to anti-LGBT policies passed in red states such as North Carolina where transgender people can only use the restroom that corresponds with the assigned gender on their birth certificate.Needless to say, Heriot s testimony made people angry, including California Rep. Zoe Lofgren. I ve got to say, I found this rather offensive,  Lofgren said upon reading the testimony.  It says to me that the witness really doesn t know anything and probably has never met a transgender child who is going through, in almost every case, a very difficult experience finding themselves. Indeed, being transgender is not a fantasy. It s reality and the struggle is very real. Not only do transgender people have to deal with discovering who they are, which often includes therapy and and medical treatments, they have to deal with bigots who have don t understand what they are going through.Lofgren was so offended by Heriot s testimony that she literally called her out for being a bigot for the record. I think you re a bigot, lady,  Lofgren told Heriot after she attempted to interrupt.  I think you are an ignorant bigot. Iowa Rep. Steve King protested on behalf of his fellow bigot by accusing Lofgren of being  out of order  but the California Democrat shut him down, too. Mr. Chairman, it is my time, and I would just like to say that we allow witnesses to say offensive things, but I cannot allow that kind of bigotry to go into the record unchallenged,  she said.Here s the video via YouTube.Lofgren was right to call out Heriot for the bullshit she wrote. As a member of the Human Rights Commission, she should be on the front lines fighting for transgender people to enjoy those same human rights that the rest of us enjoy. Instead, she s nothing more than a bigoted crony doing the bidding of transphobic Republicans.Featured image via screenshot",0
"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Friday rejected a United Nations report blaming a Saudi-led military coalition for killing or injuring 683 children in Yemen and attacking dozens of schools and hospitals as  inaccurate and misleading.    We exercise the maximum degree of care and precaution to avoid civilian harm,  Saudi U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi told reporters at the United Nations.  In a report submitted to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres blacklisted the Saudi-led coalition for its 2016 actions - even as he said it had taken action to improve child protection.  The kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the coalition reaffirm that it is taking important measures to protect civilians during all military operations to end the suffering of the Yemeni people and minimize the humanitarian cost,  Mouallimi said.   We reject the inaccurate and misleading information and figures contained in the report and we express our strong reservation with respect to this information,  he said.  The coalition had been briefly added to the U.N. blacklist last year and removed by then-Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pending review. At the time, Ban accused Saudi Arabia of exerting  unacceptable  undue pressure after sources told Reuters that Riyadh threatened to cut some U.N. funding. Saudi Arabia denied this. In an effort to dampen controversy surrounding the report, the blacklist this year is split into two categories. One lists parties that have put in place measures to protect children,  which includes the Saudi-led military coalition, and the other includes parties that have not. The report does not subject those listed to U.N. action but rather shames parties to conflicts in the hope of pushing them to implement measures to protect children. Yemen has been devastated by more than two years of civil war in which President Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi s government, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, is fighting to drive the Houthis out of cities they seized in 2014 and 2015. More than 10,000 people have been killed and the conflict has ruined the economy and pushed millions to the brink of famine.  Mouallimi blamed the Iran-allied Houthi rebels and forces loyal to Yemen s ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh for putting civilians at risk, including using children as human shields. The U.N. blacklist also named the Houthi rebel group, Yemen government forces, pro-government militia and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for violations against children in 2016. ",1
"TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese man was arrested on Tuesday after parts of a dismembered body were found in a picnic cooler in his apartment, police said, although media reports said parts of as many as nine bodies may have been discovered. Police made the grisly find in the apartment in Zama, a city just outside Tokyo, after investigating the disappearance of a 23-year-old woman earlier this month. The woman was seen on security camera footage walking with a man near the apartment, media reports said. A police spokesman said Takahiro Shiraishi, 27, was arrested on suspicion of abandoning a body, although it was not clear whose body it was.  Some body parts were found in a picnic cooler, covered with cat litter,  the spokesman said. It was not immediately clear if the suspect had entered a plea or had legal representation.  Kyodo news agency said the unidentified woman posted a message on Twitter saying she was looking for somebody who would die with her. Police declined to comment on media reports about how many bodies were found in the house. Japanese media said there were at least nine - eight women and a man. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of U.S. President Donald Trump’s most protectionist trade advisers struck a more conciliatory tone with Mexico on Wednesday, saying he wanted the two countries and Canada to form a regional manufacturing “powerhouse” with stricter rules of origin. White House National Economic Council Director Peter Navarro’s comments on Bloomberg News helped boost Mexico’s peso to nearly its highest level since Trump’s election last November. The comments indicate that Navarro, a strong voice behind Trump’s calls during the campaign for steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and China to help reduce U.S. trade deficits, was now seeking to cooperate with Mexico to the benefit of both countries. Navarro said he wanted to strengthen manufacturing in the three countries through renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Navarro said the 23-year-old trade pact could be transformed into two parallel U.S. bilateral deals with Canada and Mexico, or a modernization of the current trilateral deal. “We have a tremendous opportunity, with Mexico in particular, to use higher rules of origin to develop a mutually beneficial regional powerhouse where workers and manufacturers on both sides of the border will benefit enormously,” Bloomberg quoted Navarro as saying. “It’s just as much in their interests as it is in our interests to increase the rules of origin.” In automotive products, the biggest area of manufactured goods trade between the United States and Mexico, vehicles must have 62.5 percent North American content to qualify for NAFTA’s tariff-free benefits. Navarro has said that rule allows North American manufacturers to use too many Asian parts. Both Mexican and Canadian officials say they want to renegotiate and modernize NAFTA.  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he would trigger notification to Congress to start the NAFTA renegotiation process by late March, with substantive talks beginning later this year.  The Mexican peso, which had fallen sharply after Trump’s election on fears that trade between the two countries would be disrupted, had strengthened to below 19.5 to the dollar at midday. With the Trump administration filling out with more voices on trade issues, it is unclear how much influence Navarro will have. Ross has been designated to take a leading role on trade issues, while U.S. Trade Representative nominee Robert Lighthizer told senators in his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he would have full statutory authority to negotiate trade deals.  Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer and former USTR official in the 1980s, said he would “sort out” differences within the administration over trade.        ",1
"Marco Rubio has officially joined the anti-Trump squad. Rubio is now urging his supporters in Ohio to vote for their governor John Kasich.Ohio is Kasich s home state and is the only candidate who has a shot of taking down Trump in their primary election. Michigan proved that Kasich has wide support in the rust belt region of the Midwest, though he did not have enough support in the peninsula to actually take down Trump.Rubio s campaign director, Alex Conant, told CNN that he and the campaign recognize that rallying behind Kasich is their best chance of keeping Ohio s 66 delegates out of Trump s hands. Polls show Trump ahead in Ohio but if non-Trump supporter Republicans go all in on Kasich, it might be enough for the candidate to take the state. If you are a Republican primary voter in Ohio and you want to defeat Donald Trump, your best chance in Ohio is John Kasich,  Conant told CNN on Friday.Like any good communications director would Conant took the opportunity to drive the point home that what holds true for Kasich in Ohio, is also true of Rubio in Florida. If you re a voter and Marco Rubio is not necessarily your first choice   if you like John Kasich or you like Ted Cruz and you re here in Florida, you need to vote for Marco Rubio because he s the only one who can deprive Donald Trump of those 99 delegates,  Conant went on to say.  And if we stop Donald Trump here in Florida, we can stop him in Cleveland. He will not be the Republican nominee. Rubio does stand the best chance to steal away with Florida s 99 delegates. That s actually a huge problem for Republicans. Polls show Trump blowing Rubio out of the water in the gator state. In order for Rubio to take Florida, Both Ted Cruz and Kasich supporters would have to go all in for Rubio.That doesn t seem likely. Cruz s campaign has burned many bridges with Rubio s campaign during the election. As the runner-up, Cruz also has to maintain the posturing that comes with that position.One thing is for sure, next Tuesday s elections will probably decide who will take the Republican presidential nomination.

"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A 17-year-old Danish girl who offered to fight for Islamic State was sentenced on Monday to eight years in prison by the Danish high court for planning bomb attacks on two schools, one of them Jewish. The high court on Friday found the girl - who was 15 years old at the time - guilty of the offences, upholding an earlier district court ruling. The district court had initially sentenced her to six years in jail.  The prosecutor had called for her to sentenced to preventive detention indefinitely. The girl was arrested at her home in January last year and charged with planning the attacks after acquiring chemicals for making bombs. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The awkward efforts of Republicans to embrace their party’s standard-bearer Donald Trump looked particularly painful in Congress this week as lawmakers ducked into elevators, dashed away from reporters, ignored questions or, worse, tried to answer them.  Only days after a furor over his criticism of a Mexican-American judge, the presumptive presidential nominee sent Republicans reeling again by renewing his call for a ban on Muslim immigration after a gunman who pledged allegiance to Islamic militants killed of 49 people at a Florida nightclub. Then former reality TV star Trump waded into two sensitive topics for social conservatives by embracing the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and suggesting the country may need certain new gun control measures.   For lawmakers accustomed to well-crafted talking points and predictable lines of questioning, the week marked a chaotic flurry of contorted responses or terse, tight-lipped replies. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming walked away when asked about Trump’s embrace of the LGBT community, saying: “I don’t know what the latest is. I haven’t read anything. I haven’t been watching.” Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a former Trump adversary in the presidential primaries, had to bat away two Trump questions before he could announce that he is considering running for re-election – a decision that could determine whether Republicans retain control of the Senate in the Nov. 8 election. Senator Ted Cruz, another rival in the primaries, refused to respond directly to the speech in which Trump hardened his line on Muslims while Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr called it “an OK speech” before stepping into an elevator and refusing to respond to any more questions.   The Trump challenge is obvious even for seasoned Republicans.          “I’m spending my days commenting on everything that Donald Trump says,” lamented John McCain, chairman of Senate Armed Services Committee. Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, ricocheted from rejection of Trump’s comments on Muslims to doubts about the legality of his proposed immigration ban to bafflement over the billionaire’s response to the Orlando shootings.  Trump controversies have also overshadowed House Speaker Paul Ryan’s rollout of a policy agenda, a campaign document that was supposed to help bring Trump’s position more into line with mainline party doctrine.  Asked on Thursday whether he was bothered by having to contend with Trump’s remarks, Ryan called Trump “a different kind of candidate...(in) a different kind of year.”  Asked how many more times he would be called on to do so, Ryan said: “I don’t know the answer to that question either.” In an ironic message to his critics among the Republican leadership this week, Trump had this to say: “Be quiet, just please be quiet. Don’t talk. Please be quiet. Just be quiet.” Ryan’s response? “...You can’t make this up sometimes,” he said.   A political neophyte who has never held elected office, Trump has also said he may not need much from his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill anyway. “We have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself. I’ll do very well,” he said in a CNN interview. “A lot of people thought I should do that anyway, but I’ll just do it very nicely by myself.”    ",1

"LONDON (Reuters) - A record majority of Britons disapprove of Prime Minister Theresa May s handling of Brexit talks and they are increasingly skeptical that leaving the EU will make the country better off, an opinion poll showed on Tuesday. ORB International said 66 percent of people disapproved of the government s conduct of the negotiations, up from 64 percent last month.  The poll also showed only 27 percent were confident that May will get the right deal, compared with 47 percent who were not confident. Trust in May s handling of Brexit has evaporated since she gambled away her parliamentary majority in an election in June. With only 17 months left until Britain is due to exit the European Union, the lack of clear progress in the negotiations has raised fears of an abrupt departure with no transition that businesses say they need. For the first time, more Britons disagreed that Brexit will help the economy than agreed, ORB said.  There is no sign that the prime minister is beginning to turn things around when it comes to Brexit,  ORB said in a statement.  Overall these poll findings provide little encouragement for a prime minister facing multiple battles.  As well as trying to breath life into Brexit talks, May is dealing with a growing sexual harassment scandal in Britain s parliament. Without an overall majority, May cannot afford to lose parliamentary seats.  Businesses have expressed alarm at the progress of Brexit talks. On Monday, the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply said nearly two-thirds of European businesses planned to cut back orders from British suppliers.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 33,000 migrants have died at sea trying to reach European shores since 2000, making the Mediterranean  by far the world s deadliest border , the United Nations migration agency said on Friday. After record arrivals from 2014 to 2016, the European Union s deal with Turkey to stop arrivals to Greece and blocks on migrants inside Libya and off its coast have greatly reduced the flow, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. Professor Philippe Fargues of the European University Institute in Florence, author of the report, said the figures probably underestimated the actual scale of the human tragedy.   The report states that at least 33,761 migrants were reported to have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean between the year 2000 to 2017. This number is as of June 30,  IOM s Jorge Galindo told a Geneva news briefing.  It concludes that Europe s Mediterranean border is by far the world s deadliest,  he said. So far this year some 161,000 migrants and refugees have arrived in Europe by sea, about 75 percent of them landing in Italy with the rest in Greece, Cyprus and Spain, according to IOM figures. Nearly 3,000 others are dead or missing, it said.  Shutting the shorter and less dangerous routes can open longer and more dangerous routes, thus increasing the likelihood of dying at sea,  Fargues said. The report said:  Cooperation with Turkey to stem irregular flows is now being replicated with Libya, the main country of departure of migrants smuggled along the central route; however, such an approach is not only morally reprehensible but likely to be unsuccessful, given the context of extremely poor governance, instability and political fragmentation in Libya.  Though sea arrivals to Italy are down almost a third this year, this week there was a surge in rescues and attempted crossings. On Friday, Libya s EU-backed coastguard intercepted more than 600 mainly sub-Saharan African migrants, including many women and children, from a total of five boats that had left from the coast east of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, coast guard officials said. On Wednesday and Thursday, Italy s coast guard said some 1,600 migrants were rescued from nearly 20 vessels in the central Mediterranean.  Libya s U.N.-backed government said on Thursday it was investigating reports of African migrants being sold as slaves and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. Footage broadcast by CNN appearing to show African migrants being traded in Libya sparked an international outcry and protests in Europe and Africa. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday said he plans to tap a law professor and a former congressional staffer to serve on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agency that polices the derivatives marketplace. The White House said it plans to nominate Chris Brummer, a law professor at Georgetown University and Brian Quintenz, an investment firm founder who previously worked for former Ohio Republican Congresswoman Deborah Pryce. If Brummer and Quintenz are eventually confirmed by the U.S. Senate, it will finally allow the CFTC to fill its two vacant seats on the five-member panel. Democratic CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen left the agency in August 2015, while Republican CFTC Commissioner Scott O’Malia resigned in July 2014. The CFTC won broad new powers to police the over-the-counter derivatives market in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  The agency has largely completed writing the new regulations, and in the coming years much of the focus is expected to shift toward enforcing the rules. Debate over how the new derivatives rules will impact farmers and companies that use swaps to hedge their risks, however, has still remained a hot topic. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, whose panel will eventually vote on the two CFTC nominees, said Thursday he wants to make sure that both Brummer and Quintenz are sensitive to these so-called “end-users” who rely on derivatives to hedge against price fluctuations that impact their businesses. “For the CFTC to effectively function for all stakeholders, we must make sure nominees have a solid understanding of agriculture and prioritize the folks who use the futures and derivatives markets to manage risk,” he said in a statement. Brummer has previously worked in a variety of different roles, including some in the regulatory arena. In 2015, he completed a three-year stint serving on the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s National Adjudicatory Council, a body that reviews disciplinary proceedings of brokers and brokerage firms. He also served as an academic fellow in the international affairs office of the Securities and Exchange Commission and has taught at a variety of universities. Quintenz, meanwhile, has worked as an analyst and senior associate with Hill-Townsend Capital LLC. He also served as the director of travel and as assistant to the treasurer for the presidential exploratory committee of former Congressman John Kasich. ",1
"The American taxpayer is on the hook for the millions and millions it costs to house and feed these kids. Record numbers came here with over 10,000 in October and November. This is unbelievable! You can blame the Obama policy for this:PLEASE WATCH THIS SHOCKING VIDEO: OBAMA POLICY PAYING MILLIONS TO TAKE IN ILLEGALS:WFAA found this:As the newest surge of refugee South American children begins arriving soon in North Texas, everything from food to clothing, counseling and medical services will be provided by the nonprofit group BCFS. But, records show, taxpayers will be footing the bill.Long before the buses of workers who will care for immigrant children rolled into North Texas today, San Antonio-based BCFS was tapped by the Obama administration to provide temporary shelters in North Texas at taxpayer expense. How much is this going to cost? Neither BCFS nor the U.S. Health and Human Services department could say today.But, an online database search of federal contracts and grants shows that there was a spike in payments to the group coinciding with last year s surge of unaccompanied minors.According to USAspending.gov, BCFS received $296 million to administer the government s  Unaccompanied Alien Children Program  nationwide over the past three fiscal years. The costs for temporary shelter operations, medical care, security, room and board are requested, vetted, proposed and authorized for by the federal government,  said Krista Piferrer, BCFS spokeswoman.  All expenses are based on cost-reimbursement, which means funds are drawn down only when goods/services are requested and expended. What the records don t show is exactly what the money bought, or where it was spent.We do know one area where BCFS has spent dollars, though.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, BCFS, which used to be called Baptist Child & Family Services, has spent $210,000 on lobbying lawmakers since 2006.RECORD NUMBER OF ILLEGAL MINORS IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER OF 2015: The Department of Homeland Security has told Congress that for the past six years it has deported just six percent of youths who entered the country illegally, an enormous policy failure that illegal immigrants are seizing on to encourage friends and relatives to raid the border.Getting into the United States is so easy, and staying here a cinch, that illegals are even telling U.S. Border Patrol officials that they know they will be freed and are using social media to send home photos of their  permisos,  documents that set them free. Border Patrol agents have confirmed that the new arrivals are saying that they know they will be released after they are processed,  said Jessica M. Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies.  They have heard this from family and friends who have gone before and shared their experience. They use social media to communicate this, sometimes even texting pictures of what they call their  permiso,  which is the document they get showing them to appear for a court date years in the future,  she told Secrets.According to a Congress report, DHS told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that since 2009, it has apprehended some 122,700 unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. But it has only  repatriated  about 7,700, or 6 percent.When added to the administration s practice of releasing most illegal minors who promise to eventually show up at an immigration court hearing and a judge s order to close some detention centers, those looking to flee troubled Latin countries believe that once they get across the border that they are  home free,  said a report on the issue from the Senate Homeland panel headed by Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.A new surge of crossings by minors on the border appear to prove that out, according to Vaughan.When asked about a new report on the surge and what was fueling it, she said,  I believe that part of the reason for the new surge is that the smugglers now can assure their potential customers that they will no longer face a possibility of extended detention after being processed by the Border Patrol, because a federal judge has ordered DHS to close the family and child detention centers. Vaughan, the Center s director of policy studies, said that Border Patrol agents have revealed that new arrivals know they will be released once processed and use social media to spread the word in Latin America.Via: WE",0
"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A political activist who founded an Arab nationalist group seeking an independent state inside Iran was shot dead in the Netherlands, police said on Thursday.   Iranian Ahmad Mola Nissi, 52, established the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA), which seeks a separate state in the country s oil-rich southwestern Khuzestan province.   A Dutch police statement said a suspect was detained at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday night in The Hague after trying to flee.  His involvement in the incident is being investigated,  it said.  Emergency services were at the scene quickly and reanimated the victim, but he died shortly later.    Ahvazi Arabs are a minority in mainly ethnic Persian Iran, and some see themselves as under Persian occupation and want independence or autonomy.  They say they are deprived of decent living standards and civil rights. In an interview with Reuters in July, Mola Nissi said the movement wanted to  liberate Ahwaz lands and people from the Iranian occupation.     ASMLA s armed wing, the Mohiuddin al Nasser Martyrs Brigade, has claimed responsibility for several attacks in Iran, including the killing of two members of the elite Revolutionary Guards in January.

The death of a baby is our daily bread,  said Dr. Osleidy Camejo, a surgeon in the nation s capital, Caracas, referring to the toll from Venezuela s collapsing hospitals.The economic crisis in this country has exploded into a public health emergency, claiming the lives of untold numbers of Venezuelans. It is just part of a larger unraveling here that has become so severe it has prompted President Nicol s Maduro to impose a state of emergency and has raised fears of a government collapse.Hospital wards have become crucibles where the forces tearing Venezuela apart have converged. Gloves and soap have vanished from some hospitals. Often, cancer medicines are found only on the black market. There is so little electricity that the government works only two days a week to save what energy is left.At the University of the Andes Hospital in the mountain city of M rida, there was not enough water to wash blood from the operating table. Doctors preparing for surgery cleaned their hands with bottles of seltzer water. It is like something from the 19th century,  said Dr. Christian Pino, a surgeon at the hospital.The figures are devastating. The rate of death among babies under a month old increased more than a hundredfold in public hospitals run by the Health Ministry, to just over 2 percent in 2015 from 0.02 percent in 2012, according to a government report provided by lawmakers.The rate of death among new mothers in those hospitals increased by almost five times in the same period, according to the report.This nation has the largest oil reserves in the world, yet the government saved little money for hard times when oil prices were high. Now that prices have collapsed   they are around a third what they were in 2014   the consequences are casting a destructive shadow across the country. Lines for food, long a feature of life in Venezuela, now erupt into looting. The bol var, the country s currency, is nearly worthless.The crisis is aggravated by a political feud between Venezuela s leftists, who control the presidency, and their rivals in congress. The president s opponents declared a humanitarian crisis in January, and this month passed a law that would allow Venezuela to accept international aid to prop up the health care system. This is criminal that we can sit in a country with this much oil, and people are dying for lack of antibiotics,  says Oneida Guaipe, a lawmaker and former hospital union leader.But Mr. Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Ch vez, went on television and rejected the effort, describing the move as a bid to undermine him and privatize the hospital system. I doubt that anywhere in the world, except in Cuba, there exists a better health system than this one,  Mr. Maduro said.For entire story: NYT sMuch like the drooling college students who are turning out by the tens of thousands to  Bernie Sanders rally s in the United States, the citizens of Venezuela elected the controversial Nicolas Maduro as their president, and now they are paying a very heavy price.  BBC  While he lacks the magnetism followers of Mr Chavez attributed to the late president, he is a commanding figure in Venezuela, and not just because of his stature of (6ft 3in).Derided as a poor copy of his mentor, Mr Maduro has not been ousted by the opposition or by rivals in his own party, as some had predicted when he was elected in April 2013.However, he has failed to win over the opposition after sticking very closely to the fiery rhetoric of Mr Chavez.Tough stance His government s tough approach to mass anti-government protests in the first half of 2014 and the jailing of thousands of demonstrators prompted criticism from human rights groups and sanctions from the United States.His opponents paint him as a ruthless despot who detains his political rivals on overly harsh charges pressed by a judiciary under his party s control, while his followers say he is protecting the country from another coup.But with oil prices plummeting below $50 ( 33) a barrel, Mr Maduro s approval rating has been falling, too.Venezuela s economy is almost entirely reliant on its oil exports and the president is facing a severe economic crisis as well as a hostile opposition.And with financing for the government s generous social programs in jeopardy, some are questioning how committed those who voted for Mr Maduro really are to the socialist cause and their leader.

"Former CIA Agent, Clare Lopez has been ringing the alarm bells about the Islamic influence by members of Obama administration for quite some time now. [See video below.]Clare Lopez is a former CIA officer, and she is risking her professional career to call out President Barack Obama in the biggest way possible.Lopez is well respected in the intelligence community and worked in the Reagan White House. After two decades in the field with the CIA, and as an instructor for special forces and intelligence students, Lopez is now with the Center for Security Policy managing the counter-jihad and Shariah programs.Now, she is claiming Obama is why America has completely  switched sides  during the war on terrorism. America is now supporting the enemy, especially through the Muslim Brotherhood.Lopez has been unwilling to speak in public, but has confined with a few members of the House of Representatives her serious concerns about Obama s motivations about foreign policy decisions.Lopez noted that the war on terrorism has always been about stopping the spread of Shariah Islamic law, until Obama started to make major changes which clearly supported the Muslim Brotherhood s jihadist interests.She said the global war on terror had been an effort to  stay free of Shariah,  or repressive Islamic law, until the Obama administration began siding with such jihadist groups as the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates.The transition was easy for Obama, who already hates American values and principles as an ideologically radical Why the switch?Lopez explained, when the so-called Arab Spring appeared in late 2010,  It was time to bring down the secular Muslim rulers who did not enforce Islamic law. And America helped. And why would Obama want to do that?As she told WND earlier this month, Lopez believed the Muslim Brotherhood has thoroughly infiltrated the Obama administration and other branches of the federal government.She also came to the conclusion Obama had essentially the same goals in the Mideast as the late Osama bin Laden:  to remove American power and influence, including military forces, from Islamic lands. The former CIA operative said,  as Israel fought enemies on all sides to remain free, secure and Jewish, America began to move away from Israel and toward its Muslim enemies. And, as Iran moved inexorably toward a deliverable nuclear weapons capability, America helped. In addition, Lopez claims that the only reason Obama approved of the killing of Osama bin Laden is he simply couldn t ignore the chance without looking suspicious. The opportunity presented himself, and he  couldn t delay it any longer.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge blocked the deportation on Saturday of dozens of travelers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations, stranded at U.S. airports under an order from President Donald Trump, after a lawsuit filed on behalf of two Iraqis with ties to U.S. security forces. In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the two men challenged Trump’s directive on constitutional grounds. The suit said their connections to U.S. forces made them targets in their home country and that the pair had valid visas to enter the United States. The lawsuit highlights some of the legal obstacles facing Trump’s new administration as it tries to carry out the directive, which the president signed late on Friday to impose a four-month ban on refugees entering the United States and a 90-day hold on travelers from Syria, Iran and five other Muslim-majority countries. In an emergency ruling on Saturday, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly ordered U.S. authorities to refrain from deporting previously approved refugees as well as “approved holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals ... legally authorized to enter the United States” from the countries targeted in Trump’s order. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the temporary stay, said it would help about 100 to 200 people who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order. “I am directing the government to stop removal if there is someone right now in danger of being removed,” Donnelly said in the court hearing. “No one is to be removed in this class.” U.S. Department of Justice attorney Susan Riley during the hearing said, “This has unfolded with such speed that we haven’t had an opportunity to address all the legal issues.”  Many of the people in a huge crowd that had gathered outside the Brooklyn courthouse broke out into cheers after word of the judge’s ruling filtered out. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security in a statement hours later said only a small fraction of airline passengers arriving in the United States on Saturday were “inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented.” “These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders,” the statement said.  The department said Trump’s executive order remained in place and that its officers would enforce it.  Separately, a group of state attorneys general were discussing whether to file their own court challenge against Trump’s order, officials in three states told Reuters. The plight of one of the men who brought the lawsuit, a former U.S. Army interpreter who was detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport, is especially compelling, said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, who is not involved in the suit. “Here is a guy who was a translator who worked for the U.S. military for years, who himself was targeted by terrorists,” he said. “It is clear that if he is sent back, he is facing a direct threat to his life.” That man, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released later on Saturday and told a crowd of reporters at JFK Airport that he did not have ill feelings about his detention. “America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world,” he said.  Darweesh, 53, worked for the U.S. Army and for a U.S. contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2013 as an interpreter and engineer, the lawsuit said. The second plaintiff, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, was also detained at JFK Airport but has since been released. He is the husband of an Iraqi woman who worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq. She already lives in Houston, the suit said.  Trump, a Republican, has said his order would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. The lawsuit on behalf of the Iraqis challenges Trump’s order on several grounds. It says the order violates the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of due process by taking away their ability to apply for asylum, and violates the guarantee of equal protection by discriminating against them on the basis of their country of origin without sufficient justification.  It also says the order violates procedural requirements of federal rulemaking. The next hearing in the case was set for Feb. 10. Supporters of the order say the president has wide authority to limit the entry of foreign nationals from specific countries when it is in the national interest. “Even if they do and they win, my answer is so what?” said Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. “We are talking a few dozen people – that is just a last-ditch effort to get the last few people in. It doesn’t really change the policy,” he said. Trump’s order does not mention specific religions but Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday he was acting to help Christians in Syria who were “horribly treated.”  Comments like that could come back to haunt the president in litigation over his order, said Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration expert at UCLA School of Law. “There were comments during the campaign that focused very much on religion as the target,” Motomura said. “If the record showed that the origins of a particular measure were based on targeting a particular group, that could be challenged in court.” ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday he now recalls a meeting in March 2016 that has come under scrutiny as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump’s election campaign colluded with Russia. In testimony before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, Sessions acknowledged he attended a meeting with George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser who pleaded guilty last month to lying to the FBI. According to court documents, Papadopoulos told the meeting he could help use his Russian connections to broker a meeting between then-candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Sessions had previously testified to Congress he was unaware of communications between the campaign and Russian officials.     ",1

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Passengers from six mainly Muslim countries who would have been barred from the United States under President Donald Trump’s latest travel order will be allowed to board U.S.-bound flights on Emirates and Etihad Airways now that a federal judge has blocked it, the Middle East carriers said on Thursday. The executive order banning refugees and nationals of six Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the U.S. was temporarily halted on Wednesday, hours before it was to go into effect, by a federal judge in Hawaii. Emirates will follow guidance by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, issued after the court’s decision, that citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen would be accepted for travel to the U.S. if they possessed the necessary travel documents, an airline spokeswoman said by email. Etihad Airways “will continue to accept guests of all nationalities for travel to the U.S. provided they have valid travel documents and, if necessary, visas,” an airline spokeswoman said.  The Abu Dhabi-based carrier said it would continue to assist passengers affected by the recent executive orders but was advising them to check with their nearest U.S. mission as “U.S. travel requirements are subject to change.” The Wednesday court ruling is only temporary, until broader arguments in the case can be heard. Trump said it made the United States look weak, and promised to take the case “as far as it needs to go. A notice on Qatar Airways’ website said passengers would still need to have valid travel documents after the executive order was “enjoined.” The revised order, which was less restrictive and removed Iraq from Trump’s original list, was organized in coordination with airlines, industry group IATA has said, unlike the initial ban which came into immediate effect without notice.  Trump signed the new ban on March 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with the first order in January, which caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a Washington judge stopped its enforcement in February.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran will treat a British-Iranian aid worker as an Iranian citizen and she will serve her sentence as determined by the judiciary, Iran s foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson discussed Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe s case with Iranian officials after flying to Tehran over the weekend to try to seek her release.  One of the issues that Johnson brought up in Tehran was the issue of Ms. Zaghari,  Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi was quoted by state media as saying.  With regard to her dual nationality, from our point of view of course she is Iranian and she has been sentenced by the judiciary and she will serve the period of her sentence.  Britain says Zaghari-Ratcliffe was visiting family on holiday in April 2016 when she was jailed by Iran for attempting to overthrow the government. Johnson said he urged the release of dual nationals.  I urged their release, on humanitarian grounds, where there is cause to do so,  Johnson told the British parliament.   These are complex cases involving individuals considered by Iran to be their own citizens, and I do not wish to raise false hopes. But my meetings in Tehran were worthwhile,  he said.  It is too early to be confident about the outcome.  Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not the only dual national being held in Iran, but her case has taken on political significance in Britain after Johnson said last month that she had been teaching journalists in Iran, which her employer denies. Johnson later apologized. Opponents have called for him to resign if his comments lead to her serving longer in prison. Qassemi said the Iranian foreign ministry would follow up on Zaghari-Ratcliffe s case but said that it was ultimately a matter for the judiciary. A project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. The Thomson Reuters Foundation is a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. It says Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran. Johnson also said he raised with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif what he called  the official harassment of journalists working for BBC Persian and their families inside Iran.  The BBC has called on Iran to reverse a court order which it said effectively froze the non-liquid assets of 152 staff, former staff and contributors in Iran. ",1
"DUBAI (Reuters) - The images from the same night broadcast around the Middle East speak as loudly as the words. On the one hand: the young people of Iran, dancing in the streets to mark the re-election of a pragmatist, men and women together. On the other: the president of the United States, swaying through an all-male “sword dance” under the stars with the absolute rulers of Saudi Arabia, where publicly calling for any form of political change risks prosecution. President Donald Trump told admiring Arab absolute monarchs and military strongmen in a gilt chamber at the weekend that he wanted “peace, security and prosperity”, and the United States was not there to tell them how to run their own countries. He joined them in berating their arch-foe Iran, and signed a $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that put him firmly on one side of the sectarian divide fuelling most of the Middle East’s wars. The contrast between the two scenes was noted by Iran’s newly re-elected president, Hassan Rouhani, who has sought to reach out to the West while batting back hardliners at home. “Buying arms or building weapons won’t make a country powerful,” Rouhani told a news conference on Monday. “The foundation of power is national strength and this only happens through elections. Trump saw millions of Iranians took part in an election, but he visited a country whose people have not seen a ballot box and don’t know what an election is.” “PRE-OBAMA ERA ON STEROIDS” Trump’s attempt to orchestrate a Muslim and Arab coalition against Iran was a repudiation of the regional policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, whose administration held the first direct talks with Tehran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Although Washington and Tehran were still a long way from normalizing their relations, Obama reached an accord to lift sanctions in return for Iran curbing its nuclear program, which Trump repeatedly slated as “the worst deal ever signed”. By swinging American policy back to firm support for the Sunni Arab states, Trump has jettisoned that carefully constructed balance, said Jean-Marc Rickli, Head of Global Risk and Resilience at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.  “We are back in the pre-Obama era, on steroids,” he said. “Under Obama you had this attempt of the USA playing the external balancer in the region. Now the regional balancer has gone. The balancer has chosen his camp.” Just as dramatically, Trump also repudiated the policies of Obama’s Republican predecessor George W. Bush, who promised to spread democracy across the Middle East in a landmark 2003 speech that declared “freedom can be the future of every nation”. Trump told his audience of autocrats: “We are not here to lecture you. We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be or how to worship.” Washington’s alliance with the mainly Sunni Muslim countries of the Arab world against Shi’ite Iran is decades old. But in practice the United States has had to improvise in recent years when choosing its friends in a more complex Middle East, where enemies can appear on either side of the sectarian divide. Washington and Tehran are still frequently on opposing sides, most notably in Syria, where Iran supports the government of President Bashar al-Assad. But elsewhere, notably Iraq, U.S. forces are fighting on the same side as Shi’ites close to Iran. Obama’s outreach to Tehran reflected that reality. But those subtleties were cast aside on Sunday when Trump nodded approvingly as Saudi King Salman described Iran as the “tip of the spear” of terrorism in the Middle East. A senior U.S. official defended the initiative, citing “a common threat from terrorist organizations as well as from Iranian subversion throughout the region”. In fact, most of the militant groups U.S. troops have fought in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, such as al Qaeda, Islamic State and the Taliban, are Sunni Muslims who consider Shi’ite Iran their enemy. The timing of Trump’s uncompromising call for a U.S.-backed axis against Iran was particularly awkward because it coincided with the re-election of Rouhani, swept to a second term on his promises to seek rapprochement with the West. Although democracy in Iran has clear limits - all candidates must be vetted by a hardline body and the unelected supreme leader can veto policies of the elected government - it still goes further than in most of the countries that attended Trump’s speech, a fact noticed across the region. U.S. arms deals for Iran’s Sunni foes help bolster the case of Rouhani’s hardline opponents, who say any detente with the West is dangerous folly. The Riyadh summit showed that the “passivity” of Rouhani’s government “has emboldened the enemies of Iran,” wrote Hossein Shariatmadari, editor-in-chief of Kayhan, a newspaper closely associated with security hardliners who opposed Rouhani.         “Small and weak countries that could not imagine a fight with Iran, are now publicly talking about forming a military alliance against it.” The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), the powerful Iranian security force that supported Rouhani’s hardline opponent in the election, has the power to stir up confrontation across the region to undermine Rouhani at home. “All the indicators point to a further arms race in the region and on the rhetorical level we are on a path of escalation,” said Rickli. “You just need a small trigger that can escalate the situation on the ground.  “I would not be surprised to see an increase in hostilities in Syria and Yemen. Also, the IRGC might want to foster pro-Shi’a groups in Bahrain and some parts of Kuwait to regain power after the elections,” Rickli said. Putting a huge arms deal at the center of the visit also plays into the hands of foes who say U.S. policy is driven mainly by money. Saudi Arabia is both the world’s biggest exporter of oil and one of the world’s biggest importers of military hardware made in the West. Trump boasted about the jobs that would be created at home by the arms deals he signed. “We will make sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies, the greatest anywhere in the world,” Trump said in his speech. “Doubling down on Saudi Arabia has a lot to do with trade and investment considerations. The supporting allies, anti-terrorism and anti-Iranian rhetoric provides a cover for that,” said Richard Dalton a former UK ambassador in the Middle East. But the policy could be counter-productive, he said. “Furthering more enmity with Iran, rather than seeking common ground and interests at a time when Iran is ready to reach out diplomatically on the region’s long-term problems, is going to work against the long term aim of a peaceful and stable Middle East.” ",1

"By Brandon TurbevilleCNN is in full panic mode with the recent resumption of the Syrian government assault on terrorist-held East Aleppo. The discredited  news  agency is now reduced to rehashing tired and disproven propaganda against the Syrian government and claims that  Assad is killing his own people  by bombing head-chopping terrorists in East Aleppo.You have to hand it to CNN for consistency at least. Cutting edge propaganda, however, is not the corporation s strong suit, since every time it has tried to deliver a major blow, it has resulted in an epic fail  RECYCLED IMAGE: Yesterday, CNN used this recycled, staged image to sell its story, allegedly from a hospital in Aleppo used across US media last month.[Watch CNN reporter Will Ripley s propaganda video here, complete with staged imagery from the US, NATO Member-funded White Helmets and Aleppo Media Centre regime change NGOs]This time, the propaganda of choice is the same tired line that every bomb (excuse me, every  barrel bomb ) being dropped on East Aleppo has been dropped intentionally on top of civilians for the purpose of killing them all because . . . . well, that part has never been explained. But, for the average CNN reader, just know that Assad is a  bad guy  and that the  rebels  who demand veiled, silent, women and full adherence to Sharia law under pain of death are  good guys  and democracy-loving freedom fighters. The regime s siege of rebel-held neighborhoods has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe as food, water and medical supplies run low,  says CNN.Obviously, the humanitarian conditions in East Aleppo have nothing to do with savages and pre-historic bearded freaks running rampant and demanding that their ridiculous interpretation (or should I say  Saudi  interpretation) of their religion be enforced by the blade of a dull knife. It couldn t be because the terrorists have prevented aid from reaching civilians and have actively prevented civilians from leaving East Aleppo to flee to the (*gasp!!) government-held areas. It couldn t be because of the Western sanctions on Syria. It couldn t be because the United States and its treacherous allies funded a proxy army of extremists to destroy the country.No, it s because the Syrian military dared bomb foreign terrorists in East Aleppo. CNN uses interesting logic, indeed.SEE ALSO: RESCUE REDUX: Are Syria s White Helmets  Recycling  its Child Victims?The article laughably uses the notorious terrorist support group known as the White Helmets as its source relaying all the  horrors  of the Assad  regime.

Generally speaking, these terrorists are labeled  activists  when a quote is needed but, in the case of the White Helmets, the label of  humanitarian organization  is tossed around, a much more effective propaganda technique.But what is even more deceitful is that CNN also labels the White Helmets and the Syria Civil Defense as the same organization, an absolute fallacy as Vanessa Beeley, the individual who is probably most responsible for exposing this propagandistic terrorist organization, can personally attest to, having met with members of the real Syria Civil Defense in Syria and hearing their stories about the terrorism of the White Helmets. Beeley has also interviewed a doctor with the Aleppo Medical Association who was responsible for assessing East Aleppo refugees who stated clearly that, despite being widely popular in the U.S., the people in East Aleppo simply don t know who the White Helmets are. For them, White Helmets are just another terrorist group.None of this matters to CNN, however, since the corporation is nothing but a mouthpiece for the U.S. State Department, Wall Street, and international corporations. It is, in fact, nothing more than a propaganda site.Perhaps CNN was one of the  fake news  sites that Obama was whining about during his latest trip to Germany . . . .Brandon Turbeville   article archive here   is the author of seven books, Codex Alimentarius   The End of Health Freedom, 7 Real Conspiracies, Five Sense Solutions and Dispatches From a Dissident, volume 1 andvolume 2, The Road to Damascus: The Anglo-American Assault on Syria, and The Difference it Makes: 36 Reasons Why Hillary Clinton Should Never Be President.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Days after President Donald Trump’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Mayara Pena still has a lot of unanswered questions. One of them is about her cars. In March, she leased a 2009 Honda for her personal use and a brand new 2017 Dodge van for the small construction business she owns. On Tuesday, Pena, who came to the United States from Brazil as a teenager, learned that her authorization to work and protection from deportation under DACA will lapse in 2019, before the car leases are up.  At that point, the social security number Pena used on the leases will no longer be valid. Moreover, Massachusetts, where the 29-year-old lives, will soon require proof of legal residency to obtain a driver’s license, and Pena worries what that will mean for her existing license – and for her car insurance. In ending the program, Trump said he wants the Republican-controlled Congress to enact a permanent, nationwide solution to stabilize the lives of so-called Dreamers such as Pena, people brought to the United States illegally as children. But in the past, Republicans and Democrats in the deeply divided legislature have been unable to agree on the issue.  The administration has promised an “orderly” end to DACA, but program participants are finding it hard to get answers to their many questions about what exactly that means. Although the program is federal, the fate of its nearly 800,000 participants will vary from state to state, with state  policies determining whether or not they will be able to continue studying, receive financial aid, or even drive legally. Many states do not yet know themselves what the program’s end will mean. More than a dozen state attorneys general and the University of California system are suing Trump in an effort to reinstate the program. “I think it’s crazy because the government gave us chance to come out, they invited us to do that and now they are throwing us under the bus. It’s bad for the economy,” Pena said. “They are just putting us in the shadows again and we are not going to be able to grow.” On Tuesday night, hours after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the end of DACA, immigration attorney David Leopold held a 45-minute Facebook Live session in which he was overwhelmed by more than 200 questions and comments from people nervous about their futures.      “What about those in college who don’t pay or pay very little with DACA?” one questioner asked.     “I just received my approval” for a trip outside the country, another posted, “should I travel?”     “How should we address this with our employers?” someone else asked.     Leopold had to explain that many of the questions would require individual legal counseling or just could not be answered yet, as individual states, as well as universities and businesses, have not yet had time to evaluate the situation. Some issues that fall under the federal government will be uniform in each state. Work authorization, for example, will be withdrawn for all. But on some matters, geography will count.  At least 18 states, for example, allow for in-state tuition rates for students living in the country illegally and a subset of those - California, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas and Washington - allow undocumented students to receive state financial aid.   Three states - Arizona, Georgia and Indiana - specifically prohibit in-state tuition rates for students without legal status, and two states - Alabama and South Carolina - do not  let them enroll in any public postsecondary institution, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.   Jin Park, a 21-year-old senior at Harvard, has been in the United States since he was seven, when his South Korean family overstayed their tourist visas. He will lose his protections in August 2018.      Park is now reevaluating his plans, including applying for a prestigious Rhodes scholarship, which would require him to study abroad. He fears he would not be let back into the United States after that.  He is also worried about his long-term goal of becoming a community doctor for the immigrant community in the New York City borough of Queens where he grew up. Park says he does not think he can do his final hospital training as a resident after medical school or be licensed as a physician if he no longer has a valid work permit.   Stuart Heiser from the Association of American Medical Colleges said he has not yet heard about any guidance group members are giving current or prospective medical students.  “It is very crucial question that is just up in the air,” Park said.             For Pena in Massachusetts, meanwhile, some things seem clearer than others. Recently, she received pre-approval for a loan to buy a house. Her goal was to find a fixer-upper she and her husband would remodel. They have two U.S. citizen children. But when her DACA expires and with it her right to work legally, she does not believe a lender will take a chance on her.  “I am not even looking anymore,” Pena said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal investigators have secured a warrant to examine newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton’s private server, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday, as a prominent Democrat accused FBI Director James Comey of breaking the law by trying to influence the election. The warrant will allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to examine the emails to see if they are relevant to its probe of the private email server used for government work by Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Comey came under heavy pressure from Democrats on Sunday to quickly provide details of the emails, as Clinton allies worried the prolonged controversy could extend beyond the Nov. 8 election and cast a shadow over a Clinton transition if she wins the White House. Comey’s disclosure of the email discovery in a letter to Congress on Friday plunged the final days of the White House race between Clinton and Republican Donald Trump into turmoil. Clinton had opened a recent lead over Trump in national polls, but it had been narrowing even before the email controversy resurfaced. The unexpected turn in the email controversy shook  financial markets’ conviction of a Clinton victory in the election and the U.S. dollar slipped against major currencies in early Asian trading on Monday. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid sent a letter to Comey on Sunday suggesting he violated the Hatch Act, which bars the use of a federal government position to influence an election. “Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,” Reid, a senator from Nevada, said in the letter to Comey. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook questioned Comey’s decision to send a letter notifying Congress of the email review before he even knew whether they were significant or relevant. Comey’s letter was “long on innuendo, short on facts,” Podesta said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program, and accused the FBI chief of breaking precedent by disclosing aspects of an investigation so close to the election. “We are calling on Mr. Comey to come forward and explain what’s at issue here,” Podesta said, adding the significance of the emails was unclear. “He might have taken the first step of actually having looked at them before he did this in the middle of a presidential campaign, so close to the voting,” Podesta said. Comey’s letter was sent over the objections of Justice Department officials. But those officials did not try to stop the FBI from getting the warrant, a source familiar with the decision said, because they are interested in the FBI moving quickly on the probe. Sources close to the investigation have said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe of former Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The FBI already had a warrant to search Weiner’s laptop in that probe, but needed a warrant to look at the material that might be related to Clinton. Sources familiar with the matter said FBI agents working on the Weiner investigation saw material on a laptop belonging to Weiner that led them to believe it might be relevant to the investigation of Clinton’s email practices. Trump has highlighted the issue as proof for his argument that Clinton is corrupt and untrustworthy. “We have one ultimate check on Hillary’s corruption and that is the power of the vote,” Trump told a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. “The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions.” Comey, who announced in July that the FBI’s long investigation of Clinton’s emails was ending without any charges, said in his letter the agency would review the newly surfaced emails to determine their relevance to the investigation of her handling of classified information. Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, said he filed a complaint over Comey’s actions with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations. “We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power,” he said in a column in the New York Times. But Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at Columbia Law School, called the allegations that Comey improperly tried to influence the election “inane.” “Comey’s critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was Comey’s stated aim,” said Richman, who said he had advised Comey on law enforcement policy but not this issue. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday showed Clinton with a statistically insignificant 1-point national lead on Trump. About a third of likely voters in the poll said they were less likely to back Clinton given Comey’s disclosure. Clinton, who told a Florida rally on Saturday that Comey’s letter was “deeply troubling,” did not address the issue directly on Sunday but referred vaguely to voters overcoming a “distraction.” “There’s a lot of noise and distraction but it really comes down to the kind of future we want and who can get us there,” she told a packed gay nightclub in Wilton Manors, Florida, where hundreds of supporters who could not get in lined the streets outside. “We don’t want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality,” she said.

"Ted Nugent is once again degrading a segment of the population and this time he targeted women.In a Facebook post devoted to his love of his guns, all of which he has undoubtedly f*cked repeatedly, the conservative rocker listed the reasons why men prefer their guns over women. You can trade an old 44 for a new 22,  Nugent wrote as reason number ten on the offensive list, which then became even more cringe-worthy as it continued.Nugent went on to explain how  You can keep one gun at home and have another for when you re on the road,  and even went so far as to say that women don t act normally all month long like guns do even though PMS is a normal bodily function that all women go through in their lives.In his top reason, Nugent lamented that he can t make women shut their mouths like keeping a gun silent with a silencer.Here s his full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Top ten reasons men prefer guns over women-#10   You can trade an old 44 for a new 22.#9   You can keep one gun at Posted by Ted Nugent on Thursday, March 24, 2016This isn t the first time the Donald Trump fan has acted like a complete asshole toward women.According to Media Matters,  Nugent has a lengthy history of misogynist commentary, including calling women  worthless bitch,   worthless whore,   toxic cunt,   fat pig,  and  dirty whore. And in a disgusting defense of Trump, who is in the middle of trying to portray himself as the best candidate for women, Nugent went on a tirade against Fox News host Megyn Kelly in which the Motor City Madman said: I often turn on Fox just to look at her. Sometimes when I m loading my [gun ammunition] magazines, I like to just look at her. And I usually sit naked on the couch dropping hot brass on my stuff. Not only does Nugent prefer guns to real women, he also prefers teen girls over women as well. He wrote and performed a song about raping a 13-year-old girl in 1981. Two years earlier, Nugent suckered a 17-year-old girl s parents into making him her legal guardian so he could have sex with her.In short, not only is Nugent a coward when it comes time for real men to take action in defense of their country, he s terrified of strong independent women who think for themselves.

"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is set to rule on Monday on a legal challenge by abortion providers to a Texas law requiring doctors performing the procedure to have “admitting privileges” at local hospitals and clinics to meet hospital-grade standards.  Following is a timeline of that challenge. July 2013 - The Republican-led Texas legislature passes and Republican Governor Rick Perry signs the law known as H.B. 2, putting new requirements on abortion providers. State officials say the law is intended to ensure the health and safety of women. September 2013 – Before the law is enforced, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers challenge the measure. They assert that certain provisions, including one related to doctors’ “admitting privileges” - a type of formal affiliation - at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of an abortion clinic, are aimed at decreasing the abortion availability in the state. October 2013 – A U.S. district judge sides largely with the challengers, blocking the admitting privileges provision. March 2014 - The New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, a regional federal appeals court covering Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, reverses the lower court and permits much of the law to take effect.  April 2014 - Whole Woman’s Health and other abortion providers bring a new complaint against Texas, citing the effect of the law’s implementation and the number of clinics that have closed. The challengers focus on the admitting-privileges requirement and regulations governing clinic facility standards. August 2014 – A U.S. district court judge declares the admitting privileges and clinic requirements an unconstitutional burden on women’s access to abortion. October 2014 - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit intervenes to allow implementation of both new regulations, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocks part of the order so that the mandate that clinics meet hospital-grade standards does not go into effect. June 2015 - After considering the full merits of the challenge, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reverses the district judge’s decision, finding the judge should have deferred to the legislature’s stated health and safety goals. The appeals court also says most of the lawsuit should have been barred because the legal issues it raises already were addressed in the case filed by Planned Parenthood. June 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote puts a temporary hold on the 5th Circuit’s ruling while the justices consider whether to hear the challengers’ appeal. That action blocks the provision regarding hospital-grade standards from taking effect. September 2015 - The abortion providers challenging the Texas restrictions ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their appeal of the 5th Circuit’s ruling. November 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the challenge by abortion providers to the Texas restrictions. February 2016 - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a supporter of abortion restrictions, dies at age 79, leaving the court shorthanded and evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives. March 2016 - The U.S. Supreme Court hears 85 minutes of oral arguments in the case, known as Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. The court’s four liberal justices indicate they believe the law intrudes on a woman’s constitutional right to abortion. The four conservative justices express doubts about claims by abortion providers that the law forced numerous clinics to shut down. June 2016 - The U.S. Supreme Court is due to rule on Monday in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. ",1
"Libertarians are convinced that their presidential ticket should be getting security briefings too, just like the Democrats and the Republicans. Why? Because they seem to think there is some possible scenario where they could come out on top in November.Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton began receiving security briefings shortly after they officially became the nominees for their respective parties. Apparently, poor Gary Johnson is feeling left out.Even though it is uncommon for third party candidates to get these kinds of briefings, it wouldn t be a first. The last third party candidate to receive security briefings was John Anderson, an Independent, in 1980. And now, the Libertarian Party thinks that Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, should be eligible to receive security briefings, too.Libertarian National Chairman Nicholas Sarwark wrote a letter to the General Service Administration (GSA) on Thursday, arguing that the Libertarian candidates should be getting national security briefings since they are on the ballot in all 50 states. Even the federal government is in the business of attempting to pre-select voters  choices for President and Vice-President. Three tickets will be on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but only two are receiving taxpayer-funded national security briefings. That is just wrong, and we urge the GSA to provide the same information to Governor Johnson that is being given to Mr. Trump and Sec. Clinton. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 makes it so that all presidential candidates are able to receive security briefings, including third party candidates. However, the law also says that the candidates must have a  significant level of public support  in national polls and need to be  realistically  thought to have a chance at winning the presidency.Even though Johnson s name will be on the ballot in all 50 states, he s only polling at 8.3 percent. Which is not enough  public support  to get him onto the debate stage, let alone the White House. So I m not sure how  realistic  the possibility of a Johnson presidency actually is.On the other hand, perhaps a national security briefing or two would be good for Johnson. Maybe they could tell him what the heck Aleppo is.Featured image via George Frey/Getty Images",0
"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned on Monday that threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to pull out from the Iran nuclear accord could provoke military confrontation, adding such a move could also make exacerbate the North Korea crisis.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told Reuters on Wednesday he expects bipartisan support for approval of a bill authorizing taxpayer and industry funding for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The bill to reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act would let the FDA continue to collect hundreds of millions of dollars from drugmakers and medical device companies to partially cover the cost of reviewing new products, with U.S. taxpayers funding the remainder. “It’s an extremely important bill that I think we’ll be able to move on a bipartisan basis,” McConnell said in an interview. [L1N1IQ1CH] The FDA has been charging companies to review their products since 1992. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump proposed in his 2018 budget that the industry pay the full cost of drug and medical device reviews.  The industry at present pays about 60 percent. That proposal is unlikely to be approved in this cycle. Reauthorization of the user fee bill is typically negotiated between the FDA and industry over a period of several years. Earlier this month, the bill was approved by a Senate panel by a 21-2 vote. It must be renegotiated every five years. The FDA reviews drugs for approval or rejection for many companies, including major ones such as Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc and Johnson and Johnson. Pharmaceutical companies based overseas, including Roche Holding AG and Novartis AG, also pay these fees for U.S.-approved drugs.",1
"Acclaimed actor Robert De Niro doesn t hold back when it comes to former reality show star Donald Trump and last night was no different. While appearing at the Annual Hudson River Park Gala in Manhattan, New York, the event saw the esteemed actor honored and a bench dedicated to him, according to The Independent. The seven-time Academy Award nominee, who also won two Oscars, tore into that  lowlife  Donald Trump and that was just the beginning. One of my pleasures will be keeping people off my bench who don t deserve a view of the park like Donald Trump,  he said during a speech. F k you, Donald Trump. It s a horror with this motherf er.  The  Good Fellas  actor then went on to describe Trump as a  low life. Former Mayor Mike Bloomberg deadpanned about the famously shy actor, according to the Daily News.  It took me years before I finally got a sentence out of Bobby. He s not a big talker. Well, Mr. De Niro isn t shy anymore. During the 2016 campaign, he said,  I d like to punch Donald Trump in the face  and called him  blatantly stupid. Earlier this year, Mr. De Niro called Trump a  flat-out blatant racist , and added,  If he was smart, he d be even more dangerous. He s dangerous as it is. He s not wrong. Trump has tried on several occasions during his usual Twitter outbursts to start a war with North Korea while throwing any attempts of diplomacy out the window. The Paris Accord? Pfft! He s consistently done away with anything that has President Barack Obama s name attached to it even if it s to the detriment of our country and/or the world. Trump s profound jealousy of his predecessor was obvious long before he started his campaign and now that he was elected by conservatives touting Pepe the Frog memes in their avatars, Trump is guided solely by his feeling of inadequacy toward Obama.Good on you, Mr. De Niro.

Apparently someone asked her to sit down and since she is black, it was a hostile act of racial aggression.If you have nothing better to do, and haven t already witnessed the circus that ensues when a celebrity husband cheats on his celebrity wife with another woman, forcing the sister to even the score in an elevator, you can watch it here:Back to the Solange and her racist manifesto, where she goes to great lengths to explain the racism she encounters in just about every aspect of her life, like the time she got pulled over or the other time she had to show her passport crossing an international border. She describes the perpetrators of racism as,  a product of their white supremacy and are exercising it on you without caution, care, or thought. The main point of this crazy thing was what happened to her at a recent concert. It s written from a weird 2nd person perspective, but this is what I was able to figure out:Solange took her 11-year-old son to a Kraftwerk concert. They arrived late, despite Solange s claim that she is a big fan. Right off the bat an elderly black usher had to tell her son to stop vaping. Solange claims her young son was not vaping, so therefore it was racism.It gets worse. Solange was standing up and dancing when someone behind her asked her to sit down. She refused to sit and eventually someone threw a slice of lime at her. Again: racism. She turned around to confront whoever threw the lime but nobody s white privilege would let them admit to it. For the third time, she experienced racism.Granted, this is a one-sided explanation of things. It s entirely possible that Solange was being rude and obnoxious and the people behind her gave her a gentile reminder to behave herself in public. Then again, maybe none of this stuff even happened.The crazy level rises significantly when Solange tries to put her harrowing experience in perspective by saying:You constantly see the media having a hard time contextualizing black women and men as victims every day, even when it means losing their own lives.Shit, can you believe she almost died in this racist lime attack?She then says that she isn t claiming this incident was racism, even though she said it many times, and chides the media for potentially reporting it that way, followed immediately by this:This is why many black people are uncomfortable being in predominately white spacesFrom there Solange rants about all of the racism in America and ends with the odd statement that she has  many white friends.  You know, to prove she doesn t hate white people or something.Via:  Downtrend",0
"Thank you Angela Merkel German security service BfV reportedly received more than 100 tip-offs that ISIS militants had infiltrated the country among refugees, according to a recent report. The news comes as massive nationwide anti-terror raids took place this week.The head of the German domestic intelligence service (BfV), Hans-Georg Maassen, told a gathering of politicians that the agency had received more than 100 warnings indicating there were Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants staying in Germany as refugees, newspaper Berliner Zeitung reported Friday, without citing its sources.However , some cases of  baseless defamation  were among those tip-offs, Maassen added, according to the newspaper.German security services have remained on high alert since the November terror attacks in Paris which claimed the lives of more than 130 people.Earlier this week, police and security agents all across Germany were scrambled to search for suspects allegedly planning a terror attack in the country, with Berlin seen as the most likely target. Well-known tourist attractions including Alexanderplatz train station and the Cold War-era Checkpoint Charlie could be among the targets of a possible attack, according to preliminary media reports.On Thursday, a police special force unit raided four flats and two businesses in Berlin, detaining four men accused of allegedly having ties to Islamic State. They were suspected of being involved in planning an attack, police spokesman Martin Redlich told RT.German spy chief warns of 1,000+ radical Islamists ready to attack https://t.co/VZn1xRA2oA pic.twitter.com/BlxXGGXHkK  RT (@RT_com) December 13, 2015One of the suspects, a 49-year-old Algerian, was arrested in a three-bedroom flat in Berlin s predominantly immigrant district of Kreuzberg. He was living there on a fake French passport, local media reported, and owned two shops nearby Alexanderplatz and Checkpoint Charlie. Redlich could not confirm the landmarks were the targets, however.The spokesman said police had acted on a tip-off, but he provided no further details.Similar raids also took place in the German regions of North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony. In Berlin alone, 450 police officers were engaged in the operation, German media reported.The main suspect was a 35-year-old Algerian man detained during Thursday s raid in the town of Attendorn. Said to be a possible leader of an IS terrorist cell, he was also being sought by Algerian authorities over allegations he is a member of the terrorist group.He entered Germany in autumn 2015, having traveled the so-called  Balkan route.  At that time, the 35-year-old was registered in Bavaria as a refugee.Both men had been monitored since the end of 2015, after security services had received a tip-off they might be IS infiltrators.Another unnamed 26-year-old Algerian, who also registered as a refugee and lived in a shelter in central Hannover, is suspected by the police to be the cell s communication agent. He is also thought to have possible ties to Belgian Islamists. He has traveled to the Molenbeek district of Brussels, known for harboring jihadists, at least once in recent weeks. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind behind the November s Paris attacks, was a Molenbeek resident.Germany took in over 1.1 million refugees in 2015, and fifty-four percent of Germans believe the terror threat in the country is on the rise because of the high number of incoming migrants, according to the latest Spiegel poll.

"In an effort to  get serious,  Donald Trump unexpectedly announced a long list of federal judges he says he might pick to replace the deceased Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court should he be elected. One of his top picks (all of whom are white) is Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett. And he s apparently as surprised as anyone.Justice Willett has been pretty clear that he actively loathes Donald Trump. On Twitter, a large portion of his comments are directed towards tearing apart the Republican presumptive nominee. Just two days before Trump released his name, Willett was using a Muppets gif to sum up his feelings on the 2016 election.#Election2016 is brought to you by the letters S, M, and H. pic.twitter.com/ymJLlJO3Mg  Justice Don Willett (@JusticeWillett) May 17, 2016Many of his tweets attack Trump specifically.Low-energy Trump University has never made it to #MarchMadness.

Justice Don Willett (@JusticeWillett) March 11, 2016One from just a month after Trump announced that he would be running (and at a time when most Americans figured Trump s campaign would detonate upon lift off), Willett was already nailing Trump for his thin skin and petty insults.""With malice toward none, with charity for all . . . except for all the losers, clowns, and dummies.""

Bush s presidential campaign and was appointed a Supreme Court of Texas justice by then Governor Rick Perry. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, for instance, scoffed at Willett and his fellow selectees as being laughably right-wing. Instead, Willett s beef with Trump appears to be entirely based on the fact that, like many Republicans, he can t believe a buffoon like Trump managed to get the GOP to actively support him.Neither can we.Trump s half-baked SCOTUS nominee selection can be added to the growing body of evidence supporting the idea that Donald Trump has absolutely no idea how to run a competent campaign. While the press scrutinizes every minor slip up coming from other candidates, particularly Hillary Clinton, Trump has managed to botch his own PR efforts at every turn. On Cinco de Mayo, Trump threw every bit of common sense to the wind and tweeted out a photo of himself eating a taco bowl with the caption  I love Hispanics!  He pushed an economic plan that economists said would add $10 trillion to the deficit and then promptly retracted it. He  accidentally  sent a white nationalist delegate to the convention. His list of gaffes grows exponentially by the week. The fact that he clearly spent all of five minutes googling his list of SCOTUS nominees is shocking, but not surprising.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",0
"18 mayors sent a letter to Obama telling him that they want MORE Syrian refugees. Is your mayor on this list?Remember Syracuse is the city that saw a beautiful Catholic Church become a mosque. I m guessing the mayor wants to see more of that because the majority of the Syrians to be admitted to the US through the UN are Sunni Muslims. Kind of ironic that they penned this letter when the Pope was here. Does he want more Muslims to take over more Catholic Churches worldwide?Clearly Catholic Charities and Mayor Miner of Syracuse do!From Syracuse.com:Mayor Stephanie Miner is one of 18 mayors encouraging President Barack Obama to accept additional Syrian refugees into the United States.Miner signed a letter, sent to Obama, that calls for an increase of the number of refugees the U.S. will accept in the next two years. Obama has already pledged to take 10,000 Syrian refugees and increase the overall refugee allowance to 100,000 by 2017. Our cities have been transformed by the skills and the spirit of those who come to us from around the world,  the letter reads.  The drive and enterprise of immigrants and refugees have helped build our economies, enliven our arts and culture, and enrich our neighborhoods. All 18 mayors are members of Cities United for Immigration Action, a coalition pushing for immigration reform. Along with Miner, mayors from Los Angeles, New York City, Pittsburgh, Boston and Chicago signed the letter. [I bet if you dug into this group, you would find it another George Soros-funded group. ed]Syracuse currently accepts between 1,100 and 1,200 refugees each year. Two organizations   Catholic Charities of Onondaga County and Interfaith Works CNY   resettle refugees in Syracuse. We have taken in refugees, and will help make room for thousands more,  the letter reads. Here are the 18 cities which need new mayors:Ed Pawlowski, Mayor of Allentown, PA Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Mayor of Baltimore, MD Martin J.

"Donald Trump insulted the people of Puerto Rico just as he was getting ready to travel there to inspect the devastation caused by two Category 5 hurricanes.As a helicopter was standing by, Trump took questions from reporters as he walked to the landing pad.One question was about the hurricane relief effort that is currently underway in Puerto Rico.Trump responded by whining about the criticism of his response, which was slower than George W. Bush s response to Hurricane Katrina. Then he gave himself an A+ grade on the response and proceeded to blame the victims of the hurricane for all the problems.I think it s now no longer acknowledged what a great job we ve done. Texas and Florida we get an A plus. I think we ve done just as good in Puerto Rico and it s a much tougher situation. Now the roads are cleared. Communications starting to come back. We need their truck drivers. Their drivers have to start driving trucks. We have to do that. At a local level they have to give us more help. I will tell you the first responders, the military, FEMA, they have done an incredible job in Puerto Rico. And whether it s her or anybody else, they re all starting to say it. I appreciate very much the governor and his comments. He has said we have done an incredible job and that s the truth.Here s the video via YouTube.Keep in mind that Puerto Rico just suffered near total devastation. There is a lack of food and water and not nearly enough manpower and equipment. Much of the island still has no electrical power.Blaming the locals is what a poor leader does when he or she wants to shift the blame for their own mishandling of the situation. Trump responded badly to the dire situation in Puerto Rico and he refuses to take responsibility. Apparently, the buck always stops with someone else. Puerto Ricans should boo Trump s sorry ass back to the mainland, because he basically just doubled down on suggesting that they are lazy. Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They .  Donald J.

"This is truly shocking! Roy Moore takes a commanding lead in the Alabama Senatorial race as the allegations against him by the left and the RINO Republicans collapse. Check this out:Yesterday, the spread between the two leading candidates was 15 Today, it s 62 -40. While the internal polling for the Moore campaign had the spread at 5 points, it s looking really great for a Moore win in Alabama!NEW WITNESSES REFUTE THE ACCUSER S STORY:The witnesses say they ve shared the information with news outlets but to no one s surprise, the outlets refused to run the story. The employees who came forward offered details about the restaurant that refute the claims by the accuser. The calls for the arrest of Allred for the crime of forgery are getting louder. See the interesting discrepancies with the yearbook below:Roy Moore s campaign sent the following in a press release:GADSDEN, Ala.   On Monday evening, the Moore Campaign unveiled statements from key witnesses that completely bust the story of Beverly Nelson and Gloria Allred and further reveal an unconscionable bias on the part of state and national press to hide the truth from Alabama voters who will undoubtedly see through the  fake news  and elect Judge Moore for the man that they have always known him to be.Rhonda Ledbetter, a retired public school teacher who is currently the senior choir director at a Baptist church and teaches children at a local, church-sponsored day care center, was a waitress at Olde Hickory House for almost three years from 1977-1979. She was a college student at Jacksonville State University at the time and worked varying shifts at different times of day, multiple days a week during the time of her employment. She said in a statement:  When I heard Beverly Nelson s story, there were several details that were different from what I remember. I was nervous at coming forward because of all the attention this story has gotten, but as a moral and ethical person I had to speak up about what I know to be true. I was a waitress at Olde Hickory for almost three years from 1977-1979, and I never saw Roy Moore come in to the restaurant. Not one time. And I would have noticed because most of our customers weren t wearing suits, especially not at night. Many customers worked at Goodyear next door and would stop in on their way to and from work, and I don t remember anyone from the courthouse coming in at all. That just wasn t our crowd.   A few things stuck out to me. First, Nelson said she was 15 years old when she started working there but you had to be 16. I don t remember her from my time there, and I don t remember any 15 year olds working there at all. Second, Nelson said the restaurant closed at 10 p.m. but I know the earliest it closed was 11, though I believe it was midnight. I m certain of that because Goodyear employees came in to eat after their shift ended at 10:00 p.m., so there s no way we would have closed at that time. Third, the area wasn t dark and isolated as she described. Rather, the building was right off the busy four-lane highway and people and cars were always around. The restaurant had a wrap-around porch, like the ones at Cracker Barrel restaurants, and there were lights all around the sides of the building. So it wasn t dark and anyone in the parking lot was visible from the road. Fourth, the dumpsters were to the side of the building, not around back and there sure wasn t room to park in between the building and the dumpsters. People from the kitchen would take trash out of the side door and throw it right into the dumpsters. We were always told to park on the side of the building, because there just wasn t much room behind it. I don t remember there being an exit from the back of the parking lot, there would barely have been enough room to turn a car around. I came forward because from what I ve seen, the media is only interested in reporting one side of this story. In fact, Dixon Hayes from WRBC in Birmingham asked for former employees to contact him but never responded when I told him I never saw Roy Moore come into Olde Hickory House during the three years I worked for. Two other news outlets in the state asked to interview me and I agreed, but neither one has aired my interview and I have to wonder why they don t think the people of Alabama deserve to hear anything that counteracts the accusations against Judge Moore. It s not for me to say whether or not something happened, I can only tell the truth about factual details that I know for sure. I think all Alabamians deserve to have all of the facts so they can decide for themselves what the truth is. Despite what the national media and people in DC might say, Alabama voters are intelligent and have common sense. We don t need anyone to tell us how to vote or to explain to us what really happened. We will make that decision and I just wanted to do my part in sharing the truth on some of these important facts. I, like all Alabama voters, want any and all information that can shed light on the truth. Johnny Belyeu, Sr. is a former police officer with over two decades of experience with the Etowah County Sheriff s Department and the Gadsden Police Department. He said in a statement,  I was an officer with the Etowah County Sheriff s Department in the 1970s which means I worked in the courthouse and knew who Roy Moore was since he was the Deputy District Attorney at the time. I was a regular customer at Olde Hickory House, and I never once saw Judge Moore come in there. If he had I would have immediately recognized him. I also never met Beverly Nelson during any of the many times I frequented the restaurant, and I can t say that she even worked there. Renee Schivera of Huntsville, Alabama stated,  I was a waitress at the Olde Hickory House during the summer of 1977, before my senior year of high school. When I heard Beverly Nelson s story the first thing that stuck out to me was that I don t remember Roy Moore ever coming into the restaurant. I also don t remember her working there. The other thing that struck me as odd is that from my best recollection, the dumpsters were to the side of the building. I just know they were visible from the road, and not back behind the building. But the main thing is that if someone came in almost every night we knew who there were, and I never saw Roy Moore there. As a Christian woman, I wouldn t lie for anyone and I am only sharing what I know because it s the truth. The days of unbiased reporting are over,  Moore Campaign strategist, Brett Doster said.  The liberal media will dodge any source and refuse to air any interview that doesn t square with their effort to land a liberal Democrat in the senate seat. The Moore Campaign is committed to presenting factual truth to the people of Alabama and looks forward to victory on December 12.

"21st Century Wire says Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore reports for Newsmax TV in Las Vegas, about the ongoing federal trial involving rancher Cliven Bundy and his family.

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A little-known Chinese elevator maker saw its Shenzhen-listed shares surge the maximum 10 percent on Wednesday. The reason? The company s name resembles that of Wang Huning, a Chinese Communist Party theoretician who was elevated on Wednesday to China s apex of power.  The frenzied buying in Hangzhou Huning Elevator Parts Co, whose business has nothing to do with Wang, offers the latest example of the enduring influence of short-term speculators, despite regulators  stepped-up campaign against  pump and dump  trading. The government is introducing more foreign institutional investors, hoping they can help improve the trading culture in the country s stock market - sometimes likened to a casino. U.S. index publisher MSCI will include China A-shares in its global indexes next year. But Wednesday s surge in Huning Elevator shows that many investors still pick stocks merely by name, not fundamentals.  This is pure speculation, spurred by irrational euphoria. It has nothing to do with fundamentals,  said Yang Hai, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities.  Heady investors who chased the stock will be burnt.       Trading in Huning Elevator was calm in the morning, but that changed after the Communist Party revealed around midday its new Politburo Standing Committee, the country s top policy-making body. The seven-man unit included Wang, a one-time law professor from Shanghai who has risen steadily up the party s ranks but mostly operated behind the scenes. When the stock resumed trading in the afternoon, a buying spree pushed it up the maximum 10 percent. It gave up some gains in afternoon trading and closed up 6 percent. The elevator maker, which cannot be immediately reached for comment, forecast roughly flat nine-month profit on Oct. 13. Name-based stock-picking is not uncommon in China, especially during major political events. Last November, when news headlines pointed to a likely presidential election win for Donald Trump, shares in Wisesoft Co Ltd - whose Chinese name sounds like  Trump s big win  - surged, while Yunan Xiyi Industrial- whose Chinese name bears resemblance to  Aunt Hillary  - slumped. And when Barack Obama won the U.S. presidential election in 2008, speculators piled into home appliances maker Aucma Co Ltd, which sounds roughly like the Chinese pronunciation of Obama. Some listed firms in China even took advantage of speculators  preference for sexy names. In 2015, property developer Shanghai Duolun Industry changed its name to P2P Financial Information Services Co, in an apparent attempt to tap into investors  mania toward fin tech at the time, triggering a surge in its shares, before the bubble burst.

"(Reuters) - Some 20 demonstrators were arrested on Thursday outside a Donald Trump campaign rally in southern California, where the Republican presidential front-runner vowed to his supporters to get tough on illegal immigration if elected.  Demonstrators smashed the window of a police squad car, marched in protest and blocked traffic as police in riot gear tried to disperse the crowd outside of the county fair grounds in Costa Mesa, California, according to local media and the Twitter account of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department.   The department said on its Twitter account that about 20 arrests were made and that no major injuries were reported. Trump visited Costa Mesa, a city of more than 100,000 people, a third of whom are Hispanic or Latino, hoping to garner support in California where voters will go to the polls during the state’s Republican primary on June 7.     A strong primary win in California for the billionaire could thrust him above the delegate count needed to secure the Republican nomination for president and avoid a contested party convention in July.      During the campaign stop on Thursday, Trump promised to get tough on illegal immigration by building a wall on the border between Mexico and the United States, a popular theme of his presidential campaign, suggesting that a wall would stop drugs from coming into this country.   “The drugs are poisoning our youth and a lot of other people and we are going to get it stopped,” he said, telling the crowd that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall.   After the event, local news showed hundreds of demonstrators surrounding vehicles, waving Mexican flags and holding signs in protest of Trump outside of the Orange County Fair and Event Center. At least one demonstrator was shown jumping on the top of a police car while other demonstrators were seen shaking a police vehicle.  A Los Angeles Times reporter posted a photo on Twitter of a man wearing a Trump T-shirt with a bloodied face.  Trump has come under fire from rivals for fueling unrest with his rhetoric as several of his rallies around the country have been met by protests during the last several months. ",1

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers agreed at a panel at Harvard University that Russia likely believed it had achieved its goals and could attempt to repeat its performance in elections in other countries. “Their purpose was to sew discontent and mistrust in our elections they wanted us to be at each others’ throat when it was over,” Rogers said at the panel at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. “It’s influencing, I would say, legislative process today. That’s wildly successful.” Congressional committees have been investigating the issue since U.S. intelligence agencies in January concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to sway the election toward Republican Donald Trump. Moscow has denied any such meddling and Trump has been dismissive of the intelligence suggesting Russian involvement. Clapper said that Russia had long sought to influence U.S. voter behavior but discovered it could be far more effective at a lower cost by using social media to spread misinformation. “This is the most assertive, most aggressive and most directly impactful of any engagement that they have had in our elections,” Clapper said at the event, in Cambridge, Massachusetts just outside Boston. “They have to regard what they did as a huge success. They’ve been doing it in France and they’ll do it in Germany.” Russia has also denied attempting to influence France’s presidential election. Rogers maintained that he did not believe that Russia had specifically attempted to boost Trump’s chances of victory.  “They saw the same polls that we did,” Rogers said. “Some notion that the Russians knew that Trump had an opportunity to win this thing more than U.S. public pollsters thought, I find ridiculous.” The congressional probe on whether Russia attempted to influence the election in favor is not the only investigation into relations between Moscow and the Trump administration. The Pentagon has also launched an investigation into whether Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, accepted money from foreign entities without the required approval.     Clapper is set to testify to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the matter next week. ",1
"White House counselor Kellyanne Conway likes to call her critics  sexist  but she s always stood by amateur president Donald Trump s misogynistic attacks. In May, Conway said that CNN s Anderson Cooper was  sexist  because he rolled his eyes. Conway s boss unleashed an appalling personal attack on MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski Thursday that left even some Republicans speechless. Melania Trump has undergone numerous cosmetic surgeries, but her husband bashed  low IQ Crazy Mika  for  bleeding  after an alleged  facelift.  Then he went on to attack  Psycho Joe  Scarborough.While even House Speaker Paul Ryan said Trump s tweets this morning were not  appropriate,  Conway couldn t answer the question from a TMZ reporter.The video published by TMZ shows Conway turning herself into a pretzel trying to dodge the question as she headed as quickly as possible for the elevator. But halfway there she gave what she called a  bipartisan hug  to Rep. Debbie Dingell. That s right, she even hugged a Democrat to get out of answering the simple question about the former reality show star unleashing highly inappropriate mean-girl tweets this morning. Look,  Conway said,  a bipartisan hug. The elevator wasn t on the ground floor yet so Conway had to wait impatiently for it while she was still questioned about her boss s tweets, so naturally, she brought up the weather. It s a gorgeous day here,  she said.Back in May, Conway said,  I face sexism a lot of times when I show up for interviews like that,  of her interview with Anderson Cooper. And now it s a little more than a month later and she s strangely quiet after the alleged president launched a personal attack on Mika Brzezinski   simply because she s critical of the former reality show star. While Conway blasts the media over negative coverage, Trump is supposedly the  president  of the United States and Mika is the co-host of a cable show   only one of them is supposed to act presidential.Image via screen capture.

"In an ironic twist of politics Barack Obama has decided it would be wise to jump from his regular day job and hit the campaign trail for Hillary as she takes a  break from campaigning due to her diagnosis of pneumonia.  He said at a Pennsylvania Dem rally,  Hillary Clinton is steady and she is true. I need you to work as hard for Hillary as you did for me.  This is actually the third rally that Obama has stood in at for Hillary and no one wants to address the fact that he is using taxpayers money to make these trips. So while Obama spins Hillary s failures he is also committing acts that violate the American people.Trumps party has a statement to make towards Obama about it that states many Republicans feelings on the matter: Shouldn t you be at work?  it read.  President Obama would rather campaign for Hillary Clinton than solve major problems facing the country. This is not the first time that Trump has had to point out the unethical actions of Obama abusing the taxation system. When Hillary and Obama took Air Force One for a spin to campaign was an event that he addressed.Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2016Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2016The biggest issue is this:  The Federal Election Commission personal contribution guidelines require campaigns to reimburse individuals $1,000 for travel expenses on behalf of presidential candidates. Individuals can also spend up to $2,000 for party-designated travel and be reimbursed, but the maximum of $3,000 the Clinton campaign would give back to the president pale in comparison to the total costs of operating Air Force One. Judicial Watch estimates the cost of keeping POTUS in the air at $206,000.Lets not forget that the current administration has refused numerous times to make Obama s travel expenses available to the public for his entire tenure in office.So, while we have Iranian boats in the Persian Gulf harassing our Navy, Isis continuing their tirade across the middle east, hidden terrorist cells in on our own country, and an economy and society that are currently falling well below any level of secure that America has ever seen, Obama is playing substitute on ur dime for the most vile and hated woman in American history.Yet while Hillary calls 3/4th of the country a  basket of deplorables  and Obama claims that Repulicans are fanning  anger and hate,  he still stands at that podium and says that he has successes on diplomacy, health care, winding down the war in Afghanistan and reviving economy, which showed new strength Tuesday in a Census report documenting a jump in household incomes in 2015.As someone who claims no title either way in the political game I for one am one American that is disgusted with the way in which Obama and Hillary have lied and destroyed this country time and time again.",0
"The main stream media is totally ignoring the horrific case of a Sudanese immigrant who stormed into a Tennessee church this morning and killed 1, injured several. Nashville Police have identified the suspect of a mass shooting at a church Sunday morning as 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson.Samson is being charged with murder and multiple counts of attempted murder in the attack that killed one and left at least seven other people injured at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, a town just south of Nashville, Tenn.IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE: One brave church member, 22-year-old Caleb Engle, confronted the Samson before being pistol whipped in the face. Engle then went to his car to retrieve a gun, which he has under a concealed carry license (CCL). Engle returned to the church to confront the gunman again. The gunman shot himself in the face when the man returned, possibly by accident. He s the hero here,  Nashville police chief Steve Anderson said.  He s the person who stopped this madness in its tracks. Later today, Engle released a statement: Samson is a bodybuilder who attended high school in Tennessee and is originally from Karthoum, Sudan, according screenshots of the suspect s Facebook page. Emanuel K. Samson came from Sudan in 1996. He was a legal US resident but not necessarily a US citizen.A Nashville Police Department spokesman said the shooter entered the church after 11 a.m. CST wearing a neoprene ski mask. One woman was shot in the parking lot before the shooter entered the church and opened fire on about 42 people still inside.That s when Caleb Engle became the hero that he is It could have been so much worse!SAMSON S BOOKING PHOTO:This is Emanuel Kidega Samson s booking photo. pic.twitter.com/z0Or6rJFAK  Metro Nashville PD (@MNPDNashville) September 25, 2017",0
"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump s new national security strategy unveiled this week is a  criminal document  that seeks the  total subordination of the whole world to the interests of the U.S.,  North Korea s foreign ministry said on Friday.  This has fully revealed that  America first policy  which the gang of Trump is crying out loudly about is nothing but the proclamation of aggression aimed at holding sway over the world according to its taste and at its own free will,  a foreign ministry spokesman said, according to a statement released by state media outlet KCNA. In the document, announced on Monday, Trump said Washington had to deal with the challenge posed by North Korea s weapons programs. The U.N. Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a U.S.-drafted resolution that seeks, yet again, to toughen sanctions on North Korea in response to its latest intercontinental ballistic missile launch, diplomats said.

"Beyonc  is already a favorite target of hate for the right-wing because she s: A. Black B. A woman C. Rich D. Powerful E. Not ashamed of being black and F. Did I mention she s black? But the so-racist-it-might-as-well-be-Stormfront Drudge Report took Beyonc  hating to a new low because of the  Hold Up  music video released over the weekend.Off of the album  Lemonade,  Hold Up is a suuuuuper angry song and video dealing with Beyonc s very justifiable rage at her husband Jay-Z for cheating on her. In the video, she takes a bat and smashes the crap out of stuff. It s not entirely clear why this is controversial in the slightest. Anyone who s been cheated on wants to smash everything around them; it s a perfectly natural reaction to that kind of hurt and betrayal. So, of course, Drudge Report responded to it like this: Urban,  of course, is a right-wing dog whistle for  ni**er  but why a  terrorist?  Oh, right, because Beyonc  supports Black Lives Matter and had the nerve to recognize black history during the Super Bowl so anything she does these days is scary to the poor, persecuted white minority of America.The article Drudge links to is just as tasteless, shoehorning in President Obama and soon-to-be-president Hillary Clinton by lamenting that Obama, previously a fan,  may be changing his policy on Beyonc .  Because only white people are allowed to be angry or something. When black people do it, they re out of control and savages. Didn t you know that already?Later, the article comments on Beyonc s album about being cheated on and forgiving her husband by saying:Indeed, all of  Lemonade  appears to be Beyonc  saying she s made lemonade from lemons  meaning she s somehow stuck it out in a bad marriage despite lying and infidelity. That sounds more like the Clintons  story than the Obamas .HAHAHAHAHAHAH! That didn t feel forced at all. Even a little.Now, if Beyonc had gone out and actually smashed people s cars in a rage instead of channeling her anger into a creatively destructive music video, OK, fine, call her names. But for the love of all that s holy, it s a MUSIC VIDEO. I know Drudge makes money by feeding the hate and rage of the right-wing but this is a stretch, even for them.By the way, if you want to see Beyonce get righteous with a bat, you ll have to go to TIDAL and sign up for a free trial.Featured image via Getty",0
" (This Aug 31 story corrects location of Burkhead s home in third paragraph.) By Christian Shepherd BEIJING (Reuters) - American tourist Nicholas Burkhead said he d be happy to return to his latest holiday destination, with its beautiful scenery, great food and friendly people. The problem is, the destination was North Korea and a U.S. State Department ban on travel to the isolated country takes effect on Friday. Burkhead, a 35-year-old resident of Virginia, was among the last American tourists to leave North Korea, landing on Thursday in Beijing.  I was surprised at how friendly everyone was,  Burkhead said after stepping off the last scheduled flight to Beijing from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, before the U.S. travel ban kicks in.  It was very relaxing - beautiful scenery and they fed us very well in the restaurants there, but the exchange rate wasn t too good for the local won,  he told a waiting scrum of reporters. Burkhead arrived in Beijing on North Korea s state-owned Air Koryo after visiting Pyongyang as well as the city of Kaesong near the heavily armed border with South Korea. His five-day tour cost 1,850 euros ($2,200). Other Americans on the flight included two aid workers as well as Jamie Banfill, 32, who had led tours to North Korea but was visiting this time as a tourist. Banfill, who had made the trip to say goodbyes after regularly traveling to the North for a decade, said the travel ban short-sighted.  It s an extremely complex situation on the Korean peninsula and they oversimplified it,  he said. The United States last month announced a ban on U.S. passport holders from traveling to North Korea, effective Sept. 1. Journalists and humanitarian workers are allowed to apply for exemptions under the ban, which is similar to previous U.S. restrictions on travel to Iraq and Libya. Heidi Linton, director of Christian Friends of Korea, who has been working in North Korea for more than 20 years, told reporters she worried about the people her aid group helped, if her exemption was not granted soon.  We started a hepatitis B program and we have 705 patients that have been started on life-saving medicine, that if they go off that medicine then their lives are in danger,  she said.    It was not immediately clear how many Americans had sought, or been granted, exemptions or how many were still in North Korea. An official at the state department said it was not able to give an estimate on the number of U.S. citizens there. North Korea is under growing international pressure over its nuclear tests and repeated ballistic missile launches, including one this week that flew over northern Japan. The U.S. ban on travel to North Korea followed the death of U.S. college student Otto Warmbier, who was jailed during a tour last year. Warmbier, who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda sign, was returned to the United States in a coma in June and died six days later. The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear, including why he fell into a coma. Warmbier had been detained leaving the airport in Pyongyang.    I was expecting a strict security check on exit but there was nothing like that,  Burkhead said. The State Department declared U.S. passports invalid for travel to, in or through North Korea. The restriction applies for one year unless extended or revoked by the secretary of state. North Korean state media has described the ban as a  sordid  attempt to limit human exchanges. North Korea is currently holding two Korean-American academics and a missionary, as well as three South Korean nationals who were doing missionary work.  This month, North Korea released a Canadian pastor who had been imprisoned there for more than two years. Hundreds of Americans are among the 4,000 to 5,000 Western tourists who visit North Korea annually, according to U.S. lawmaker Joe Wilson. ",1
"You just can t make this stuff up Yet another key member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe appears to have deep ties to the Democratic Party.From PJ Media: Aaron Zebley served previously as Mueller s chief of staff at the FBI and as a senior counselor in the National Security Division at the Department of Justice. He also served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the National Security and Terrorism Unit in Alexandria, Virginia.Also, in 2015 when he was a lawyer, he represented Justin Cooper, the IT staffer who personally set up Hillary Clinton s unsecured server in her Chappaqua home, Fox News  Tucker Carlson revealed on his show Thursday.Cooper, it so happens, is also the aide who destroyed Clinton s old BlackBerries with a hammer.Watch the brilliant television ad Ted Cruz s team made during the election, that mocked Hillary Clinton and Justin Cooper for destroying evidence of her crimes, when they smashed her Blackberrys with a hammer:Documents obtained by Fox News show that Senate investigators grew frustrated with Zebley after being repeatedly stonewalled when they were trying to set up a meeting with Cooper. Mr. Zebley telephoned Homeland Security [Committee] staff to inform them that Cooper had chosen to cancel the interview,  the documents said.In a letter to Cooper, congressional investigators complained:  We are troubled by your attorney s [referring to Zebley] complete refusal to engage the committee in a discussion about how to further assuage your concerns. Let this sink in. The same attorney who played a defensive role for Hillary Clinton was tapped by Mueller in June to play an offensive role against Clinton opponent Trump.But Zebley isn t the only questionable hire. Out of a team of fifteen lawyers, nine of them have donated to Democratic candidates. None of them seem to have Republican leanings.Jeannie Rhee, who was hired by Mueller last summer to work on the probe, was the personal attorney of Ben Rhodes and also represented the Clinton Foundation, Fox News  Laura Ingraham reported on Wednesday.",0
"Ever since Donald Trump rode down the escalator at Trump Tower and announced his disgraceful bid for the White House, people have been making jokes about his alleged love affair with Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin. This is more than fair; after all, Putin is the ONE person Trump refuses to criticize. The orange one has viciously attacked everyone from the cast of the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, to Congresspeople and Senators in both his own party and the opposing party, too many celebrities to mention, cable news hosts, and just about anyone else you could think of. But not Vladimir Putin, not ever. The only close second is Trump s bizarre coddling of white supremacists and Nazis.Therefore, it must be the ultimate humiliation to have Putin do the unthinkable to Trump in a VERY public way: and say, and I quote, that,  is not my bride.  According to the New York Times, the Russian dictator seems to be tiring of Trump s chaos. At this point, Putin has spent a lot of political capital on the world stage helping get Trump elected, and yet Trump has failed to deliver sanctions relief, a better U.S.-Russia relationship, or anything else to the brutal dictator. Putin reportedly said of Trump: [He is] not my bride, and I am not his groom. Of course, Trump wants to be seen as a man s man, so to be emasculated by being referred to in the feminine by the man whose bitch everyone has accused him of being is really rubbing salt in that wound. Apparently, Putin made the remarks when being asked about what he thought of the idea that Trump might be removed from office forcibly before his four-year term is completed. Of course, no matter how humiliating this is for Trump, there will be no retaliation. He can t strike out at Putin; after all, this is the one man on the face of the planet who likely has the MAJOR goods on Trump.Now, if only Putin would grow tired of this game and release the most damning information ever and help us end this embarrassing American nightmare.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images",0
"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz have reached a coalition deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party, a source said on Friday, paving the way for Austria to become the only western European country with a far-right party in government. The deal, in the wake of an Oct. 15 parliamentary election dominated by Europe s migration crisis, brings the Freedom Party back into government for the first time in more than a decade. A person familiar with the talks confirmed that a deal had been reached shortly after it was initially reported by Austrian news agency APA. ",1
"(Reuters) - A Vietnamese student activist was jailed for six years plus four years of probation by a local court on Wednesday for conducting propaganda against the state, his lawyer said. Despite sweeping reforms to its economy and growing openness to social change, including gay, lesbian and transgender rights, Vietnam s sole Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism. Phan Kim Khanh, 24, is a student studying international relations and the eldest child of a Catholic farming family in a remote area north of capital Hanoi. He had written blogs criticizing the government before he was arrested earlier this year.  The proof used in court against Khanh was vague,  lawyer Ha Huy Son told Reuters, adding he was not certain if Khanh wants to appeal. Human Rights Watch on Tuesday called on Vietnam to drop all charges and release Khanh.  The bogus crime of conducting propaganda against the state is designed to silence peaceful critics of the Vietnamese authorities,  said Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch s Asia director.   Vietnam ought to get rid of these laws and stop persecuting students and ordinary people for just talking about the country s problems on the internet.  ",1
"Americans were warned by Attorney General, Loretta Lynch to not offend Muslims or they would pay a heavy price. Did anyone think she, or her boss were kidding? Barack Obama offends Christian Americans on a regular basis when will the FBI place a bounty on his head?

Authorities call it a desecration of the Islamic worship center.The Quran, the holy book of Islam, prohibits Muslims from eating pork, and pigs have been used to taunt or offend Muslims.Both the FBI and Las Vegas police say they re investigating the case as a possible hate crime.Las Vegas police spokesman Larry Hadfield said the bacon was wrapped on the door knobs, and was also found on the ground and fences.Officials at the mosque couldn t immediately be reached for comment.The FBI said the incident happened about 3:15 a.m. Dec. 27. The culprit is described as a white man wearing a dark blue hat, jacket and black-framed glasses. He had black or dark brown hair with long, thin sideburns.The site west of the Las Vegas Strip wasn t damaged, and no one was hurt. The mosque was empty at the time, and the case was reported by members who came to worship later that morning.Several threatening incidents at mosques have been reported in recent weeks. A Molotov cocktail went off at an Islamic center in Tracy, California, days ago, and a severed pig s head was found outside a Philadelphia worship site earlier this month. Via: APThe vandalism, which is being called a hate crime, has left the Las Vegas Muslim community on edge, according to KSNV. ",0
"Anthony Scaramucci got his ass handed to him on Sunday morning by CNN host Jake Tapper.Just a day has gone by since Scaramucci became the White House communications director, resulting in the resignation of Sean Spicer as press secretary a mere six months into Trump s presidency, and he is already insisting that the Russians did not interfere with the 2016 Election just because Trump said so.That s despite our nation s intelligence agencies and former and current intelligence officials confirming otherwise.During a discussion about whether Trump will sign the bipartisan legislation that slaps sanctions on Russia, Scaramucci used an anonymous source to claim that the American people have been misinformed about Russia. There s a lot of disinformation,  Scaramucci said.  Somebody said to me the other day   I don t want to say who   if the Russians actually hacked this situation and spilled out those emails, you would have never seen it. You would have never had any evidence of them. Meaning that they re super confident in their deception skills and hacking. But our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russian did, in fact, meddle in our election by attacking our democratic institutions by hacking, which can be traced back to the perpetrators by our own professional cyber security experts. Basically, Scaramucci is claiming that the Russians are too good to get caught by us. That s simply not true.And Tapper was quick to call Scaramucci out for it, but not before he slammed Scaramucci for citing an anonymous source. Wait, wait, wait,  Tapper chimed in.  I don t know who this anonymous person is. And then Scaramucci demonstrated that, just like Trump, he can t keep his mouth shut and is a leaker. How about it s the president, Jake,  Scaramucci replied.  He called me from Air Force One and basically said to me,  This is   maybe they did it, maybe they didn t do it. Wow. That s truly pathetic.Tapper proceeded to tear Scaramucci apart for being Trump s yes-man instead of accepting the analysis of our own intelligence agencies and Trump s own Director of National Intelligence. This is exactly the issue!  Tapper said.  We have experts, the U.S. intelligence agencies [are] unanimous, both Obama appointees and Trump appointees   the director of national intelligence, the head of the National Security Agency, the head of the FBI. I mean, all of these intelligence experts, saying, Russia hacked the election, they tried to interfere in the election. President Trump is contradicting it and you re siding with President Trump! Indeed, it certainly appears Scaramucci is just shilling for Trump and he even proceeded to whine about Tapper s observation, leading Tapper to ask,  Don t you owe a duty to the truth? Scaramucci then claimed that he doesn t know what the truth is because:  I don t have the information in front of me. But he didn t even bother to get the information. Instead, he got talking points from Trump and merely parroted them on television like a good little lapdog.Here s the video via YouTube.Scaramucci is already making it clear that he is untrustworthy. He just threw our intelligence community under the bus and demonstrated that he is the kind of leaker that Trump whines about. He couldn t even stop himself from bragging about how Trump himself was the anonymous source who told him Russia didn t hack us. The evidence clearly shows that Russia attacked us and our democratic institutions. Only self-serving fools would believe otherwise. Featured Image: Screenshot",0
"Donald Trump s Education Department is pathetic now that Betsy DeVos is in control, and this proves it.DeVos  first week as Secretary of Education has been terrible to say the least.First, she was blocked from entering a public school by protesters and ran away. Then she posted a tweet jokingly asking where the pencils are, which drew a sharp rebuke from teachers, who did not find her  joke  funny because they usually have to buy their own school supplies for their classrooms.And so, the Department of Education under DeVos  rule is off to a rough start, and it got downright embarrassing on Sunday as Americans watched in horror as the Education Department proceeded to post Twitter messages containing misspelled words.Seriously.

"The Defense Department secretly set up a program ten years ago to investigate unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, at the urging of then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, according to new reports.Both The New York Times and the website Politico published stories Saturday revealing the existence of the Pentagon s now-defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.The New York Times said the UFO program began in 2007, while Politico reported in began in 2009.According to the reports, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, helped steer money under the program to a donor s aerospace research company.A Pentagon spokesman said the UFO program ended in 2012, though The New York Times said the Defense Department still investigates potential episodes of unidentified flying objects. The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program ended in the 2012 timeframe,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told Politico.  It was determined that there were other, higher-priority issues that merited funding and it was in the best interest of the DoD to make a change. White added:  The DoD takes seriously all threats and potential threats to our people, our assets, and our mission and takes action whenever credible information is developed. Politico said the program was not classified but few officials knew about it. Reid secured the funding for the program in 2009 with the help of former Hawaii Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye and former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, who have both since died.Both outlets said Reid s interest in UFOs was the result of friend, and donor Bob Bigelow, who owns Bigelow Aerospace and has said before he is  absolutely convinced  aliens exist and UFOs have visited Earth.The New York Times said the program had a $22 million annual budget and  most of the money  went to Bigelow s research company, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program.

He also complained about photos of himself that NBC used that he found unflattering.At one point, Trump turned to NBC News President Deborah Turness and told her the network won t run a nice picture of him, instead choosing  this picture of me,  as he made a face with a double chin.I hear Donald Trump really hates this photo.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that President Barack Obama and European leaders did not discuss imposing sanctions against Russia over its military involvement in Syria when they met in Berlin on Friday. “We did not discuss in concrete terms sanctions against Russia with regard to this,” Merkel said at a joint news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Merkel said the leaders had, however, discussed sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict. She said no decision had been made yet on whether to extend those sanctions but added that progress towards implementing the Minsk peace agreement was not sufficient. ",1

"New York City begs to differ Of course, this is just another way of Obama saying,  Screw Trump and screw America, we re building Muslim communities in your hometowns and communities with or without your permission. In an official statement on the eve of Ramadan, an Islamic holy month, Barack Obama said the United States would continue to welcome Muslim refugees despite  voices that seek to divide us. I stand firmly with Muslim American communities in rejection of the voices that seek to divide us or limit our religious freedoms or civil rights,  he said in the statement.  I stand committed to safeguarding the civil rights of all Americans no matter their religion or appearance. Obama s speech regarding Ramadan, the monthlong holiday observed by Muslims through fasting during daylight hours, did not mention Donald Trump by name, but clearly seemed to be directed towards the Republican nominee. Here in the United States, we are blessed with Muslim communities as diverse as our nation itself. There are those whose heritage can be traced back to the very beginning of our nation, as well as those who have only just arrived,  he said. Via: Townhall ",0
"Rachel Maddow noticed Ted Cruz bragging about being endorsed by Ted Nugent, and she didn t let him get away with it.Last month, Ted Cruz boasted about being endorsed by a pastor who thinks Hitler was sent by God to exterminate Jews, and now he s boasting about gaining the support of a man who thinks Jews who support gun control are Nazis in disguise.As Maddow pointed out on Friday night, Cruz s website proudly displays a message crowing about Nugent s support of the Texas Senator. TED NUGENT SAYS TED CRUZ IS HIS FAVORITE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,  blares the headline on Cruz s weebsite.Maddow then listed the other slimy people who Ted Cruz is proud to call supporters of his campaign.One of those supporters is anti-gay conservative pastor Kevin Swanson, who wants to execute all gay people. Cruz actually shared a stage with Swanson in Iowa late last year and bragged about it instead of distancing himself from him.Another supporter of Cruz is Pastor Mike Bickle, who once said that Hitler was sent by God to exterminate Jews because they refused to convert to Christianity. Cruz embraced Bickle s support last month.And now Cruz is openly bragging about being endorsed by Nugent, who not only went on an incredibly anti-Semitic rant about Jews who support gun control, he also shit his pants to avoid being drafted during the Vietnam War, has called for the assassination of President Obama, and has a fascination with pedophilia. If you re Senator Cruz and you put this up on your website proudly embracing an endorsement from Ted Nugent   showing off, campaigning even tonight on the fact that you are the choice for president of Ted Nugent   then you do kind of own this,  she argued.  Just like you own the guy who said that God sent Hitler to kill all the Jews, because you campaigned on his endorsement, too. Just like you own it when the guy saying every gay person in America should be executed, because you attended his event. You shared a stage with him. You did not have to do that. Honestly, this year, Ted Cruz is shooting the moon on this stuff. I don t know how long it s gonna be before the Beltway notices this pattern and realizes it might be a real issue for him. Here s the video via MSNBC.Earlier in the segment, Maddow noted that Cruz also spoke at Bob Jones University, a Christian indoctrination camp that forbids homosexuality, forbids interracial dating, and supports segregation as if it is stuck in the 1950s.The bottom line is that Ted Cruz is a dangerous religious zealot who should not be allowed anywhere near the White House, or the US Senate, or any public office for that matter. His views and supporters are just too extreme in this country and go against our values as a nation. Featured image from Flickr",0
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Thursday nominated U.S. Congressman Xavier Becerra to be attorney general, a high-powered pick that signals the state’s readiness to defend its progressive policies as Republicans consolidate power in Washington. In choosing Becerra, 58, Brown is tapping a pragmatic and reliably progressive Democrat with a deep knowledge of Washington politics as the state’s top lawyer. He will replace Democrat Kamala Harris, who was elected last month to the U.S. Senate, at a time when California is positioning itself to respond to anticipated conservative policies from Republican President-elect Donald Trump. “California’s prosperity and people are currently under threat by a hostile Trump administration,” California Senate leader Kevin de Leon said on Thursday. “Xavier will serve as a guardian of the Constitution and an ultimate check and balance against the forces of division and scapegoating that are mobilizing in Washington.” Brown, a Democrat who is particularly concerned that Trump and congressional Republicans will try to roll back environmental protections and reduce the U.S. role in efforts to combat climate change, cited Becerra as someone who could battle such efforts. “Xavier has been an outstanding public servant – in the State Legislature, the U.S. Congress and as a deputy attorney general,” Brown said in announcing the appointment. “I’m confident he will be a champion for all Californians and help our state aggressively combat climate change.”  The appointment also takes Becerra out of the running to become the ranking member of Congress’s powerful Ways and Means committee. In a statement released on Thursday, outgoing ranking member Sandy Levin, a Michigan Democrat, indicated the position would be filled by U.S. Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts.  A Stanford-trained lawyer, Becerra served as California’s deputy attorney general before winning a seat in Congress representing the northeastern section of Los Angeles in 1992. In Congress, Becerra rose to chair the House Democratic Caucus and  also served on the Ways and Means Committee and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. “California right now is ahead of the country when it comes to clean energy, commonsense treatment of immigrants, real health security and so much more,” Becerra said. The Sacramento native said in a conference call with reporters he would welcome friendly overtures from Trump and the Republicans who control Congress, but promised sharp pushback if the federal government tries to undo progressive policies on immigration, the environment, worker protections and other issues. “If you want to take on a forward-leaning state that is prepared to defend its rights and interests, then come at us,” Becerra said. If approved by the Democratic-majority state legislature, Becerra will replace Harris after she resigns from the post to join the Senate in coming weeks. Harris, also a Democrat, replaces U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, who is retiring. ",1
"LISBON (Reuters) - A Portuguese court has handed long prison sentences to six members of a bogus religious cult that sexually abused boys, including their own children, under the pretence of rituals on a farm just southeast of Lisbon. Tuesday s verdict by the Setubal district court sentenced Rui Pedro, the 36-year-old leader of the self-proclaimed Celestial Truth sect, to 23 years after finding him guilty of rape, procuring prostitution, child pornography and other crimes, a court official said on Wednesday.  His wife and four other men were sentenced to prison terms of between 7 and 19 years. Two women were acquitted. The crimes were committed between 2011 and 2015, mostly on a farm rented by the group in 2014. Prosecutors told the court that the cult was fake, and its rituals set up as a means to lure and scare the children. The eight victims, including the leader s son and the son of another of the sentenced men, had been told that the sect s  Master  had supernatural powers and could perform  acts of purification  on them, which was the term for sexual abuse. The boys, aged between 5 and 16 at the time of the crimes and mostly from the Setubal area, were kept in fear of his powers so they never disclosed what happened to anyone.  Their families had been led to believe the children played football or studied and received psychological counselling or religious guidance on the farm. Police arrested the group in 2015 after one of the members, Andre Marques, reported them to the authorities. He was still sentenced to 19 years, as the court ruled that he had only cooperated  to save his own skin , daily newspaper Publico reported. ",1

"HANOI (Reuters) - The United States and Vietnam on Tuesday signed an agreement allowing the U.S. Peace Corps to work in the country for the first time. The signing, which comes amid a historic three-day visit by President Barack Obama, follows more than a decade of negotiations between the two countries to establish a Peace Corps operation in Vietnam. The program, which is expected to begin over the next two years, allows Peace Corps volunteers to teach English in schools in the country’s two largest cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, said Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet, who signed the agreement with Vietnam’s ambassador to the United States, Pham Quang Vinh. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who was present for the signing, said the agreement marked a further normalizing of relations between the United States and Vietnam. “For 20 years now we have had what we call a normal relationship,” said Kerry, who in 1968 served as a young U.S. naval officer in the Vietnam War.  “This is normal, having the Peace Corps being able to move forward, having young Americans come here, not always young, to be able to teach English in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh is the next step forward to building the relationship between the United States and Vietnam,” he added. After the signing, Hessler-Radelet turned to Kerry saying: “You’ve waited for this for a long time.” ",1
"When the bombshell dossier exposing Donald Trump s shady ties to Russia became public, it was easy to question the validity of the document. Although the golden shower accusation was the least important detail of the report, it certainly caught the attention of the public and was enough to make just about anyone say no way this can be legit. But according to CNN, U.S. intelligence agencies have been investigating the dossier and the document is gaining credibility because some of the details it contains are actually checking out.CNN reports:Law enforcement and U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing their investigation, but they say the corroboration of intercepted communications gives them a  greater confidence  in the dossier s validity.Naturally, Trump s team is already screaming  fake news    again. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told CNN,  We continue to be disgusted by CNN s fake news reporting.  He then called back to add this:This is more fake news. It is about time CNN focused on the success the President has had bringing back jobs, protecting the nation, and strengthening relationships with Japan and other nations. The President won the election because of his vision and message for the nation.Intelligence officials emphasized that the conversations they intercepted were between foreign nationals and came from routine information gathering. They also noted that some of the communications were from people who were known to be  heavily involved  in digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton to help Trump.U.S. intelligence agencies have still not come to any final conclusions regarding whether or not Russia really has any compromising information on Trump that they can use to blackmail him. They have also not confirmed any of the more  salacious  claims made in the dossier. In other words, they still don t know if Trump paid Russian prostitutes to  drain the swamp  for him.You see more on this here, via The Young Turks:.@CNN is reporting that an investigation into the  Pee-gate  dossier is gaining credibility. pic.twitter.com/j6CEHZJktN  The Young Turks (@TheYoungTurks) February 11, 2017Featured image via Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",0

"Die-hard amnesty for illegal aliens cheerleader Rep. Luis Gutierrez: Every time a little thing like this happens, they use the most extreme example to say it must be eliminated. Reporting on a recently released survey by Rasmussen Reports that indicates that 62% of Americans oppose sanctuary city policies, Telemundo, the nation s second largest Spanish-language network, slanted its coverage in favor of maintaining the controversial policy. Reporting from the sanctuary city of Chicago, Telemundo correspondent Janet Rodr guez cited an unauthorized immigrant in favor of the policy, along with two quotes from Congressman Luis Guti rrez (D-IL), who had the gall to minimize Kate Steinle s murder, at the hands of a hardened criminal and five-time deportee, in the sanctuary city of San Francisco.Although Rodr guez reported the study s findings that the majority of Americans not only oppose the policy, but also support withholding federal funding to make sanctuary cities comply with immigration authorities, she included only one critical view of the policy, that of presidential candidate Donald Trump calling sanctuary cities  a disgrace.  To make matters worse, Rodr guez also misled viewers about the considerable trans-partisan nature of the opposition to sanctuary city policies. Rodr guez stated on air that  it has to be emphasized that the poll reveals that the majority of those who agree on eliminating sanctuary cities or that in some way they lose federal funds, all are Republicans. However, the poll actually indicates that 79% of Republicans, 61% of unaffiliated voters, and 46% of Democrats believe sanctuary cities should lose federal funds. Similarly, 79% of Republicans, 65% of unaffiliated voters and 43% of Democrats support U.S. Justice Department legal action against sanctuary cities.Via: Newsbusters ",0
"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates’ foreign minister said on Wednesday President Donald Trump’s travel ban on citizens of seven mainly Muslim countries was an internal affair not directed at any faith, a more measure reaction than others from the region. Trump’s order affecting Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen has triggered protests across the United States and beyond. But Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed said most Muslims and Muslim countries were not included in the ban and the named states faced “challenges” that they needed to address. “The United States has taken a decision that is within the American sovereign decision,” Sheikh Abdullah said at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Abu Dhabi. “There are attempts to give the impression that this decision is directed against a particular religion, but what proves this talk to be incorrect first is what the U.S. administration itself says ... that this decision is not directed at a certain religion.” The UAE, a major oil exporter, is a close ally of the United States and a member of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamist militants in Syria. Sheikh Abdullah gave a guarded welcome to another Trump initiative, a proposal for humanitarian safe zones in Syria.  “If the aim behind these areas is humanitarian and temporary and under an international umbrella, I think this is a basis we can work on,” he said. “But I think that it is still early to decide what our final stance toward these zones is before we hear from the new U.S. administration the ideas and develop that further,” he added.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s strategy on North Korea aims to pressure Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear and ballistic missile programs by tightening sanctions and Washington is open to negotiations, the Trump administration said on Wednesday. The U.S. stance, which appeared to signal a willingness to exhaust non-military options, was put forward in a statement following an unusual White House-hosted briefing for the entire Senate. It described North Korea as “an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority.” “The United States seeks stability and the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We remain open to negotiations towards that goal,” it said in a joint statement by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. “However, we remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies.” Although the statement emphasized diplomacy, Democratic Senator Christopher Coons told reporters after the White House briefing that military options were discussed. “It was a sobering briefing in which it was clear just how much thought and planning was going into preparing military options, if called for, and a diplomatic strategy that strikes me as clear-eyed and well proportioned,” Coons said.

"NEW DELHI, ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - India denounced Pakistan on Tuesday over the treatment of the family of an Indian man sentenced to death for spying, saying they had been harassed during a visit, a charge Pakistan called  baseless . Among other things, the Indian government accused the Pakistani authorities of refusing to return the shoes of the visiting wife of Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav after she turned them over to security for the visit. Jadhav, a former officer in the Indian navy, was arrested in March 2016 in the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, where there has been a long-running conflict between security forces and separatists, and he was convicted of planning espionage and sabotage. His wife and mother were allowed to see him behind a glass window on Monday, eight months after he was sentenced to death, but that gesture of goodwill appeared to have quickly descended into acrimony. Ties between the nuclear-armed neighbors are in a deep chill and Jadhav s case has added to long-running tensions, with each accusing the other of supporting cross-border violence.  Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said Jadhav s family had been subjected to harassment when they arrived to see him.  The Pakistani press was allowed on multiple occasions to approach family members closely, harass and hector them and hurl false and loaded accusations about (Shri) Jadhav,  Kumar said in a statement. Pakistan s foreign ministry rejected the accusations.  The Indian baseless allegations and twists ... about the visit of the wife and mother of Commander Jadhav, a convicted terrorist and spy, who has confessed to his crimes, are categorically rejected,  it said. The Pakistani statement added that it had kept both Pakistani, Indian and international media  at a safe distance, as requested by India . Pakistan authorities say Jadhav confessed to being assigned by India s intelligence service to plan, coordinate and organise espionage and sabotage activities in Baluchistan  aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan . India says Jadhav is innocent, and it won an injunction from the World Court to delay his execution, arguing he was denied diplomatic assistance during his trial by a military court. On Monday, Pakistan released a picture of Jadhav s mother, Avanti, and wife, Chetankul, seated at a desk and speaking to him from behind the glass partition. Islamabad said it had honored its commitment to give access to the family.  But India said Jadhav s mother was not allowed to speak in her native Marathi language and was frequently interrupted during the meeting.  Kumar said the two women had been asked to remove the red dot that Hindus wear as well as their jewelry and shoes during security screenings, adding that Pakistani authorities had refused to return the shoes that Jadhav s wife had worn. The Pakistani foreign ministry rebuttal did not address the report of the missing shoes. India and Pakistan often accuse each other of spying, and several people have been held in prisons for years in both countries, some on death row, to be used as bargaining chips in their troubled relationship.

"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservatives and the anti-immigrant Freedom Party (FPO) have agreed to expand voter participation in legislative matters in their coalition deal to bring the state closer to the citizens, the party chiefs said on Saturday. Austria is set to become the only western European country with a far-right party in government after the FPO under Heinz-Christian Strache and Sebastian Kurz s People s Party (OVP)  struck a coalition deal on Friday. But their plans for more direct democracy ruled out referendums on Austrian membership of the European Union.  Our model does not provide for any referendum ... that contradicts European law or fundamental rights or our constitution,  Kurz said.     It is also clear that there will be no votes on our memberships in international organizations including the European Union.      The introduction of more ways for voters to participate in the legislative process was one of the FPO s main conditions and also one of the most difficult issues in the coalition negotiations.     In Austria around 8,000 signatures are needed currently to initiate a popular petition. If the petition then gets more than 100,000 signatures it must discussed in parliament. Such petitions are not legally binding and often do not result in legislation but they can fuel the public debate.  In future, if a petition has the support of 900,000 voters and parliament does not support the issue, it can be turned into a legally binding referendum, Kurz said at a news conference in Vienna, where he and Strache presented the coalition program. Austrians will have to vote on this proposal as it will require a comprehensive change to the constitution, for which a vote is already mandatory, Kurz said. There were only two binding referendums in post-1945 Austria: The nuclear power referendum in 1978 and the European Union membership referendum in 1994.   History will be written (with this initiative),  said Strache.  In Europe, the Swiss vote the most, whereas Germany has not as yet held a nationwide referendum. Ireland and Italy are the European Union countries with the most referendums.  ",1
"Trump made a visit to the Keystone State in an effort to bolster his numbers for the upcoming Pennsylvania Republican primary election. While there, he managed to prove just how utterly CLUELESS he is about literally anything that happens in the state in two very huge ways, which you will see below.First came Trump s incredibly outdated remark about bringing back the steel industry s lost jobs to the state. Pennsylvania had a long history of major steel manufacturing, but the majority of it was lost decades ago. The jobs literally have been gone in many areas of the state for more than 20 years, and Trump thinks that him arguing with China will bring them back.As a Pennsylvanian myself, I can tell you it s really something that blue-collar and middle-class people do not forgive easily. Making what amounts to an ignorant mockery of an issue that many in the state still feel betrayed over due to massive outsourcing of industry from America, will hit Trump badly   especially among his somewhat aged voter demographics that lived through those days of economic collapse.If you thought that was bad, you haven t seen anything yet. Trump then went on to say something even more offensive about Penn State Football.Trump asked people at the gathering,  How s Joe Paterno? Are we gonna bring that back? How about that whole deal? The silence afterwards could have been cut with a hatchet.Here is just a short list of what s wrong with Trump s statement. Joe Paterno died in 2012. We won t be bringing him back. That  whole deal  Trump is talking about is a child sex scandal that was covered up within the Penn State football program, where a member of the staff was literally having sex with children on campus property. Joe Paterno was forced out over it.Literally EVERYONE in PA knows this. Penn State football is like a religion to many in the state, and for Trump to say what he did shows how ignorant he is about Pennsylvania. Insulting Penn State football is something literally nobody ever did in order to win an election in the state. I can t wait to see how this turns out for him on primary day. What a joke.Watch Trump suggest he wants to bring back a child sex scandal below:Featured image via video screen capture",0
"(Reuters) - Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, is trying to win support from the Midwest corn lobby for a broad legislative overhaul of the nation’s biofuels policy, according to sources familiar with the matter. The effort comes as President Donald Trump’s White House mediates talks between the rival oil and corn industries over the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of corn-based ethanol and other biofuels in the nation’s fuel supply every year. Oil refiners say the regulation costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year and is threatening to put a handful of the nation’s refineries out of business. Ethanol interests have so far refused to budge on proposals to change it. Cornyn “is working hard to unify all stakeholders in a consensus effort to reform the Renewable Fuel Standard,” an aide to the senator told Reuters. The aide, who asked not to be named, did not provide details. Cornyn, of Texas, the U.S. state that is home to the most oil refineries, is part of the Senate’s leadership team, responsible for securing the votes needed to pass the Republican party’s legislative agenda. Two lobbyists for the oil refining industry said Cornyn was having some success cobbling together a coalition of lawmakers and stakeholders around a potential RFS reform bill that could be dropped early next year. However, similar efforts to unify these rival factions have fallen flat in the past. Any such effort would need the buy-in of legislative backers of the ethanol industry, like Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, the top-producing state for corn. Officials for the senators did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Both Grassley and Ernst have previously repeatedly expressed their intention to defend the RFS in its current form. The White House has been hosting negotiations between both sides of the issue over short-term remedies that can provide relief to refiners struggling with the existing regulation. The refining industry says compliance now costs it hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and threatens to put some refineries out of business. Refineries that do not have adequate facilities to blend ethanol into their gasoline must purchase blending credits, called RINS, from rivals that do. RIN prices have risen in recent years as the amount of biofuels required under the RFS has increased. Refineries that buy RINs include Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Monroe Energy, both of Pennsylvania, and Valero Energy Corp of Texas. Valero said RINs cost it around $750 million last year, though there are competing arguments over whether refiners pass along those costs. Senator Ted Cruz, also of Texas, last week sent a proposal to the White House to cap the price of RINs at 10 cents each, a fraction of the current price. The proposal was widely rejected by the ethanol industry. The ethanol industry has said in the past that placing caps on the credits was a non-starter, and has instead argued for policies to increase volumes of ethanol in the U.S gasoline supply. The industry claims this would boost supplies of the credits, lowering their prices. Prices of renewable fuel credits have fallen in recent weeks on reports of the discussions in Washington. The price hit 68 cents on Wednesday, nearing a seven-month low, according to traders and Oil Price Information Services. The White House has not yet commented on Cruz’s proposal. The RFS was introduced by former President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions. It has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. The refining industry has pressed the Trump administration repeatedly to adopt reforms that would lower the credit costs or otherwise ease the burden on refineries, but the ethanol industry has successfully defeated those efforts so far.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that NATO is not obsolete, as he had declared on the campaign trail last year, but said NATO members still need to pay their fair share for the European security umbrella. At a news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump thanked NATO members for their support of his decision last Thursday to launch 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack on civilians and said it was time to end Syria’s civil war. “I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete,” Trump said, adding that the Transatlantic alliance was adapting to the broader mission against Islamic militants that he had urged. Stoltenberg said he had an excellent and productive meeting in the Oval Office with Trump. ",1

"Julian Assange became a computer hacker in his teen years. Assange got married when he was 18 and has a son. He and his wife separated and in 1999, after a protracted court battle, he reached a custody agreement with his wife.Assange gained worldwide fame and became a household name after he released hacked DNC emails shining a light on the ugly and questionable inner workings of Hillary, her campaign and many in the Democratic Party.Assange, who has been living in the embassy for four years after he was granted political asylum by Ecuador, came under fire this week after a 8,000-plus-file dump of CIA secrets was posted on WikiLeaks.Vice President Pence Thursday vowed to go after the web site, saying the leak was  one of the most significant compromises of national security in recent memory. Apparently Baywatch  star Pamela Anderson has a  thing  for  the world s most famous leaker, Julian Assange. Anderson s gone from slow motion runs on the beach to mysterious late night visits to the embassy where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is holed up.Anderson was most recently spotted entering the Ecuadorian safe space in London Thursday night wearing a camel overcoat, snug black top   and either a really short skirt, or no pants at all.Anderson, 49, is a regular at the facility, coyly smiling for photographers as she struts inside to see Assange, 45, whose rogue outfit has dumped some of the US government s most closely guarded secrets.She refused to deny the dating rumors   saying he intellectually stimulates her more than all her  ex-husbands and lovers combined. I think he s quite sexy,  she wrote in a blog post on Thursday.  He has tremendous strength and stamina   though vulnerable. Hard to imagine him that way   as capable as he is. But, he is up against the biggest super powers in the world. Speaking to John Bishop on The Nightly Show this week, she described meeting Assange last year through British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood. We started seeing each other every month, and now we see each other a lot more regularly,  she said, according to The Sun. I do really think he s one of the most important people in the world, and I think what he does is historic. It s very important,  Anderson added.  He s very brave and he sacrificed a lot for all of us. NYP",0
"Almost as scary as the idea that Hillary would lie about a major health concern, is the fact that we have no idea who Hillary will choose as her running mate Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton s disappearance from the debate stage last month left people speculating that the former First Lady took a long bathroom break, but now a law-enforcement source with inside connections is alleging that Clinton was missing from the stage due to health issues stemming from a previous brain injury.These long-lasting symptoms stemming from a concussion and blood clot, according to a neurologist, suggest Clinton is suffering from post-concussion syndrome, which can severely impact her cognitive abilities.All that said, however, Clinton s campaign maintained to Breitbart News that she is in good health and can serve as President of the United States. Strong source just told me something I suspected. Hillary s debate  bathroom break  wasn t that, but flare up of problems from brain injury,  wrote John Cardillo on Twitter.Cardillo, who previously worked as an officer who provided VIP security details for the New York Police Department (NYPD), told Breitbart News that he knows of two additional sources who have commented about Clinton s health problems, which have even impacted her ability to walk to her car after delivering a speech. I got this from both a [federal agent]   and I also got it from a New York [NYPD] guy who worked security at a Hillary event in New York City,  Cardillo told Breitbart News, adding:These are two people that aren t just personal friends. I worked with one and then post law-enforcement worked with another on some related things. So, these aren t anonymous people. These are good friends. Both of them told me the same thing, that after her speeches, whether she did a talk or a policy speech, she had to sit behind   she would come off the podium backstage   and have to sit and rest before making it back to the car because she was so fatigued, dizzy and disoriented.Cardillo said these two security officials don t know each other and do not live in the same state, but  their stories were almost identical. One of the men told him that Clinton was  very pale, kind of disoriented. He said she looked like she was about to faint. She was very pale, almost sweaty. Cardillo said one of the incidents occurred while she was Secretary of State. The event worked by the NYPD official was roughly a year ago.Veteran Republican strategist Roger Stone, who previously worked with GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, told Breitbart News that he has also heard about Clinton s long-term health problems. A number of New York Democrats, very prominent, well-known, wealthy New York Democrats, told me last year that Hillary had very significant health issues and that they were surprised that she was running in view of her health problems and her lack of stamina,  Stone told Breitbart News.  So far, she s run a very controlled campaign, I don t think she has the physical stamina to be president,  he stated.  I have no doubt that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) won t call her on it, but Trump certainly would. We also know that in the emails, of course, Huma Abedin  says that she is easily confused,  Stone added, referencing Clinton s close confidant Abedin comment in an email,  She s often confused,  referring to Clinton.Trump, Stone s former boss, certainly hasn t been shy in questioning whether Clinton has the  stamina  to be president. She goes out and she sees you guys for about 10 minutes, she sees you for a little while, it s all rehearsed and staged,  Trump said in a recent interview on Fox News  Media Buzz. They ll pick a couple of people out of the audience that are like, you know, 100 percent. She ll sit around a little plastic table, they ll talk to the people for a while. It s ridiculous,  Trump added.  And then she goes away for five or six days and you don t see her. She goes to sleep. Neurologist Dr. Daniel Kassicieh, D.O., reviewed news reports of Clinton s head injury in light of the recent information revealed from the security sources that are raising questions about her current health status.Kassicieh, who has run his own Sarasota, Florida, practice for 20 years, is a board-certified neurologist and the medical director of the Florida Headache and Movement Disorder Center. He is a doctor of osteopathic medicine, which is similar to a medical doctor but can involve at a minimum of 100 more classroom hours of specific training. That additional training is focused on the osteopathic or the musculoskeletal system aspects of medicine. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology (FAAN) and a Fellow of the American College of Neuro-psychiatrists (FACN). Kassicieh is a registered Republican in Sarasota, but his purely medical analysis is troubling for Clinton. They were trying to poo-poo this off as a minor concussion, but I would just say that reading it and trying to take all the politics out of it, and just read it purely from a medical standpoint,  Kassicieh explained:Considering the point of what happened with Hillary over this time period  the timeline  and then what has happened here more recently  the break at the debate, I saw that and even the commentators that were sitting there made a comment that,  Gee, that seems awful long for a break.  Just looking at it from a neurological standpoint, the risk factors for developing post-concussion syndrome, one of them is age, and she was 65 when this happened  just from a physiologic standpoint that s an older individual. Being female is a risk factor for post-concussion syndrome as well. For someone who has treated many post-concussion syndrome patients and that s what I really believe she s suffering from based on reading these reports and reading what s happened,  Kassicieh said.  I think she has latent post-concussion syndrome, and I can understand that as a politician they would want to be covering that up.  He stated:I would say as a neurologist having seen many post-concussion syndrome patients that I would not want a president who I knew had post-concussion syndrome being president because their super high-level cognitive abilities are clearly impaired and even their routine multitasking high-stress abilities are affected because post-concussion syndrome patients in general don t tolerate even moderate work, stress-related environments.Kassicieh added that if suffering from post concussion syndrome, Clinton s symptoms could appear  well beyond a year  after her concussion. A transverse sinus thrombosis [blood clot] is a rare condition of a clot forming in the venous sinus cavities surrounding the brain,  Kassicieh told Breitbart News, referencing an ABC News report from 2012 that detailed Clinton s head injury and blood clot following a fall. He explained:These venous sinuses drain blood out of the brain. The [injury] incidence is only about 3 per 1,000,000 adults. The transverse sinus is less commonly affected than the main sagittal venous sinus. The cause of transverse sinus clots is not well understood although trauma and dehydration have been described as risk factors. Mrs. Clinton suffered from both.Dr. Nicholas C. Bambakidis also analyzed the facts for Breitbart News. He is the director of cerebrovascular and skull base surgery, and the program director of neurological surgery at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, and a professor of neurosurgery and radiology at the CWRU School of Medicine in Cleveland, These types of clots are usually formed spontaneously without an obvious cause,  Bambakidis said in an email:They can be associated with dehydration, a predisposition to blood clotting disorders, are more common in women and may be associated with oral contraceptive medication, severe head trauma, brain surgery, or infection. If untreated, they can progress and lead to bleeding in the brain or swelling, and a stroke or even death. The treatment is generally anticoagulation and treatment of any underlying cause.Bambakidis said that if treated early and quickly, there are no longstanding issues with a person s health. Typically, if caught early and treated adequately (as seems to have been done in this incident) there is a full recovery without any consequences (normal cognition, memory, etc),  he said.Dr. Jane Orient, the executive director of the politically conservative Association of American Physicians and Surgeons also reviewed the 2012 ABC News report about Clinton s concussion and blood clot. She said she thought the ABC report appeared medically accurate. Factors predisposing to clots include air travel, dehydration, hormones, immobilization as during surgery, blood abnormalities, cancer,  Orient said.  Concussions can cause long-term damage including cognitive problems, even when standard studies including CT or MRI look normal. Not saying Mrs. Clinton has any of the above just speaking generally and hypothetically,  she clarified.For entire story: Breitbart News",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are making progress toward legislation to address Puerto Rico’s financial crisis and could produce a bill as early as Thursday, the top House Democrat said. “It was supposed to be filed yesterday; (they) put it off to today.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backed off a series of proposed changes to the nation’s biofuels policy after a massive backlash from corn-state lawmakers worried the moves would undercut ethanol demand, according to a letter from the agency to lawmakers seen by Reuters. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in the letter dated Oct. 19 that the agency will keep renewable fuel volume mandates for next year at or above proposed levels, reversing a previous move to open the door to cuts.  The move marks a big win for the biofuels industry and lawmakers from corn-states like Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois, while dealing a blow to merchant refiners like PBF Energy Inc and Valero Energy Corp who hoped the administration of President Donald Trump would help provide regulatory relief. The White House issued a statement hours after the Pruitt letter was delivered to lawmakers expressing the president’s support for maintaining the renewable fuel plan.  “President Donald J. Trump promised rural America that he would protect the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and has never wavered from that promise,” the White House statement said. Trump’s second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses in early 2016 gave credibility to his candidacy and he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in the Nov. 8 election. It was the first time a Republican had won Iowa since George W. Bush in 2004 and provided Trump a key takeaway. The letter could end uncertainty about the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard that has roiled commodity and energy markets for months. The program, which requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply or buy credits from those who do, appeared on the verge of a massive overhaul. The most popular form of program credits hit two-month highs on Friday on the EPA news, traders said..  The so-called D6 credits sunk to 68 cents last month as EPA considered cost-cutting measures, but prices have rebounded in recent weeks and approached 90 cents on Friday, traders said. Pruitt said the EPA would not pursue another idea floated by EPA leadership that would have allowed exported ethanol to be counted toward those volume quotas. Pruitt also said the EPA did not believe a proposal to shift the biofuels blending obligation away from refiners was appropriate. That plan is backed by representatives of a handful of independent refining companies who have warned the cost of the program will bankrupt plants and cost thousands of jobs. Those ideas would have eased the burden on some in the refining industry, who have argued that biofuels compete with petroleum, and that the blending responsibility costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. But Midwestern lawmakers, including Republicans Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst, had vocally opposed all those ideas, calling them a betrayal of the administration’s promises to support the corn belt. They were concerned the moves would undercut domestic demand for ethanol, a key industry in the region that has supported corn growers.  “It’s a great day for Iowa and a great day for rural America. Administrator Pruitt should be commended for following through on President Trump’s commitment to biofuels,” Grassley said in a statement. In the letter, Pruitt said the EPA was prepared to work with Congress to examine the possibility of a waiver that would allow the sale of E15 gasoline, containing 15 percent ethanol, year-round - something currently not permitted during the summer due to concerns about smog. Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Bob Dinneen said in a response to the letter on Friday morning that the U.S. ethanol industry was “grateful for Administrator Pruitt’s epiphany on the road to the RFS.”  The program disproportionately hurts mid-sized refiners and mom-and-pop gas stations that are the backbone of the nation’s energy infrastructure and needs to reformed, said Greg Blair, a spokesman for the Fueling American Jobs Coalition, a group of merchant refiners formed to seek changes in the program. “If the administration follows the course set out in Administrator Pruitt’s letter, manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states – jobs President Trump promised to protect – will be at risk,” Blair said.

Commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters in Beijing that U.N. sanctions gave a  cushioning  or buffer period for implementation of the ban on coal and seafood imports from North Korea. The comment was in response to a question about data from China s customs administration showing China imported 1.6 million tonnes of coal from North Korea in August, the first since February, when Beijing banned purchases of the fuel from its northeast neighbor. On Aug. 14, the commerce ministry said it would allow any cargoes that were already at port to clear customs as usual before the U.N. sanctions came into force on Sept. 5. ",1

"Donald Trump apparently hopes poor people starve or freeze to death.In order to make way for a massive increase to our already bloated defense spending, Trump plans to gut just about any domestic program that benefits Americans, especially low-income Americans.While Trump s family lives in a gold-plated tower and can eat anything money can buy, he apparently is just fine with letting the rest of us live in squalor with little to eat and no heat for warmth.You see, Trump s budget includes massive cuts to Meals On Wheels, which provides millions of hungry senior citizens with healthy meals and a courtesy well-being check.But that well-being check will likely end up becoming a nightmare if Trump is able to eliminate heating assistance programs.Millions of Americans are too poor to heat their own homes, so the next time a Meals On Wheels volunteer tries to serve your grandma or grandpa a nice meal, you could end up getting a phone call informing you about how your beloved grandparents froze to death because they didn t get their heating assistance one particularly cold month next winter.Trump s budget would literally make life a living hell for poor Americans who are already struggling to take care of themselves and their families. Trump supporters are especially going to feel the sting because they are the working poor in red states who rely the most on government aid.This budget is so bad that New York Times columnist Charles Blow referred to Trump as a  damned MONSTER  for proposing it.What kind of damned MONSTER proposes a budget like this?!!!

"Carly Fiorina has joined the ranks of the biggest hypocrites of all time. Joining the likes of Josh Duggar, Sarah Palin and Kim Davis, Fiorina has committed the ultimate of egregious errors: She worked for a company that profited from fetal stem cell research.In a scathing report from Al Jazeera America, Fiorina was exposed for collecting some $83000 working for a major pharmaceutical company:Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, a staunch opponent of abortion, made at least $83,000 serving on the board of directors of Merck & Co. at a time when the pharmaceutical company was producing vaccines using fetal stem cell lines derived from aborted fetuses, according to corporate documents reviewed by Al Jazeera America. The program  Inside Story  with Ray Suarez also obtained documents indicating that during Fiorina s tenure on the board, anti-abortion groups had asked Merck to stop producing such vaccines, and that the company had refused.How can someone be so openly  pro-life  and still cash a check earned at least in part by the use of fetal tissue?

"Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a federal contractor at the NSA, was arrested for leaking a classified report containing what has been described as  Top Secret Level  information on Russia s attempt to interfere with the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Winner appeared in federal court on June 5, facing one charge of removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet.Winner was employed by Pluribus International Corporation and had been assigned to a U.S. government facility in Georgia since February, working in a position that granted her a top-level security clearance. She had also previously held a similar clearance with the U.S. Air Force. Her arrest was announced about an hour after The Intercept published a story based on an NSA document detailing Russian attempts to hack American voting systems in 2016. Although the Justice Department hasn t stated whether Winner was arrested in connection with The Intercept s story, the site noted that the National Security Agency (NSA) report cited in its story was dated May 5, a date shared by an affidavit supporting her arrest.According to The Intercept s report, Russian military intelligence, specifically the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, conducted the cyber attacks described in the document: Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors   executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions.   The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to   launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations. An affidavit sworn by FBI Agent Justin Garrick claimed that the government was notified of the leaked report by the news outlet that received it and the agency that housed the report determined only six employees had made physical copies, one of whom was Winner. The affidavit also stated that Garrick interviewed Winner at her home and she admitted intentionally identifying and printing the classified intelligence reporting at issue  and mailing it to the news outlet. The U.S. Government Agency examined the document shared by the News Outlet and determined the pages of the intelligence reporting appeared to be folded and/or creased, suggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space,  the affidavit continued.Titus Thomas Nichols, Winner s attorney, declined to confirm whether his client had been accused of leaking the document. My client has no [criminal] history, so it s not as if she has a pattern of having done anything like this before,  Nichols said in a phone interview on Monday to the Associated Press.  She is a very good person. All this craziness has happened all of a sudden,  adding that she hadn t stated or shown any form of confession.Winner remains in federal custody pending a hearing scheduled for June 8.Featured image via Facebook",0
"The Democratic and Republican nominees for the Nov. 8 presidential election are decided in a series of state-by-state contests. The key to winning the nomination for each party is ultimately not about the popular vote, but about securing the number of delegates needed to win the nomination at each party’s convention - July 18-21 in Cleveland for the Republicans and July 25-28 in Philadelphia for the Democrats. The following is a guide to the nominating process: Q: Is the delegate selection process the same for the Republican and Democratic parties? A: No. The parties set their own rules. One thing that is the same is that at each party convention, a candidate needs to reach only a simple majority of the delegate votes to win the nomination. Q: How many delegates are there? A: The Democratic convention will be attended by about 4,763 delegates, with 2,382 delegates needed to win the nomination. The Republican convention will be attended by 2,472 delegates, with 1,237 delegates needed to win. Q: I keep hearing about “superdelegates.” Are they different from other delegates? Do both the Republicans and Democrats have superdelegates? A: Superdelegates, officially known as unpledged delegates, are a sort of wild card in the nominating process, but only the Democrats have them. The category was created for the 1984 Democratic convention, and according to political scientists, they are a legacy of the 1980 convention when there was a fight for the nomination between President Jimmy Carter, who was seeking a second term in the White House, and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Members of Congress were frustrated by their lack of influence, because delegates elected to support one candidate could not switch to support another. So Democratic members of the House of Representatives led an effort to win a role for themselves. That resulted in the creation of superdelegates. Unlike other delegates, superdelegates may change what candidate they are supporting right up to the convention. There is no fixed number of superdelegates because the group is defined by various categories whose members change from one election cycle to another. Here is who gets to be a superdelegate:  All Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate; the Democratic governors; the Democratic president and vice president of the United States; former Democratic presidents and vice presidents; former Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate; former Democratic speakers of the House and former Democratic minority leaders. Throw in the members of the Democratic National Committee and the former chairs of the DNC and you finally have the whole pool of superdelegates. Q: What about the other delegates? Do they get to choose which candidate to support? A: Both the Democratic and Republican parties send delegates to their conventions based on the popular vote in the primary elections and caucuses held in each of the 50 states. But the parties have different rules on how delegates are allotted to a candidate. The Democratic Party applies uniform rules to all states. In each state, delegates are allocated in proportion to the percentage of the primary or caucus vote in each district. But a candidate must win at least 15 percent of the vote to be allocated any delegates. The Republican Party lets states determine their own rules, although it does dictate some things. Some states award delegates proportionate to the popular vote, although most such states have a minimum percentage that a candidate must reach to win any delegates. Some other states use the winner-take-all method, in which the candidate with the highest percentage of the popular vote is awarded all the delegates. Other states use a combination of the two methods. States that use the proportionate method may instead use the winner-take-all method if one candidate wins more than 50 percent of the popular vote.  In addition, the Republican Party requires that all states with nominating contests held between March 1 and March 14 use the proportional method, meaning that all the states holding votes on Super Tuesday will have to award delegates proportionally.  Q: What happens to delegates if a candidate drops out of the race? A: Another good question, because we have certainly seen that happen this year. For the Democratic Party, in every state, delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates. For the Republican Party, it varies by state. In some states, delegates are required to stick with their original candidate at least through the first ballot at the Republican National Convention. In some other states, if a candidate drops out, his or her delegates may immediately pledge to another candidate. There is also a middle ground in which those delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s air force carried out another round of long-range drills on Monday, flying into the Sea of Japan and prompting South Korean and Japanese jets to scramble, and again around self-ruled Taiwan amid growing tension over China s assertiveness.   China has in recent months ramped up its long-range air force drills, particularly around Taiwan, claimed by China as its own.  The air force said in a statement that fighter and bomber aircraft flew through the Tsushima Strait that separates South Korea from Japan and into international waters in the Sea of Japan. The Sea of Japan is not Japan s, and the drills were lawful and reasonable, air force spokesman Shen Jinke said in the statement, describing the exercises as routine and pre-planned. The Japanese Defence Ministry said in a statement that the aircraft - two SU-30 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one TU-154 reconnaissance plane - had not violated Japan s airspace.  In Seoul, South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff said five Chinese military planes were spotted entering the Korean Air Defence Identification Zone, and fighter jets scrambled in response.  The Chinese aircraft also flew through Japan s Air Defence Identification Zone, they said.  Our fighter planes took normal tactical measures, identifying the models of the Chinese planes and flying aerial surveillance until they left,  the South Korean statement said. Chinese air force spokesman Shen alluded to the scrambled aircraft, saying they  responded to interference from foreign military aircraft  but were able to achieve the aim of their drill. Taiwan s military said that China had staged a separate drill at the same time, flying a plane through the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines and then returning to base through the Strait of Miyako, to Taiwan s north and near Japan s southern islands. Taiwan monitored Japan sending F-15 fighters to intercept, Taiwan s defence ministry added in its statement. The Japanese Defence Ministry identified the plane as Y-8 electronic warfare aircraft. There was no violation of Japan s airspace in this instance either, the ministry said.     China s air force last week conducted  island encirclement patrols  near Taiwan, after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened that China would invade the self-ruled island if any U.S. warships made port visits there. China suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who leads the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, wants to declare the island s formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. China s air force exercises also come amid regional tensions over North Korea s nuclear and missile programmes, with bellicose rhetoric from both North Korea and U.S. President Donald Trump. ",1
"Ted Nugent isn t having it! He s being compared to Kathy Griffin by the left and he s had enough of it!We will never forget the night before the election at the very last rally for candidate Trump TED NUGENT WAS THERE AND PLAYED HIS HEART OUT!Conservative rocker Ted Nugent, who once told a concert crowd that Barack Obama should  suck on [his] machine gun,  says its unfair to compare him to embattled comedian Kathy Griffin.  There s no comparison whatsoever,  Mr. Nugent said during a radio interview Wednesday on  The Ben Ferguson Show,  The Washington Examiner reported.  We re talking apples and grenades here,  he said.  What Kathy Griffin did was downright vulgar, obscene, and a genuine variation of a death threat. I ve never threatened anybody.  Ms. Griffin is facing a wave of backlash for doing a graphic photo shoot holding a realistic mock severed head of President Trump. She has since apologized for the photos and had them removed, but lost her long-running New Year s Eve gig at CNN as a result. Despite his history of off-color comments, Mr. Nugent was invited to the White House in April for a dinner with Mr. Trump. Liberals in the media immediately compared Ms. Griffin s controversial stunt to Mr. Nugent s past comments, claiming there is a double standard.Mr. Nugent, who serves on the NRA s Board of Directors, reportedly told a concert crowd in 2007:  Obama, he s a piece of s . I told him to suck on my machine gun.  Speaking in 2012 at an NRA convention in St. Louis, he said,  We need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November.  And in January of last year, he called for both Mr. Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to  be tried for treason & hung. Via: WT",0
"During his radio show on Friday, Rush Limbaugh suggested that legalizing rape would be easy as long as you frame it as a civil rights issue like same-sex marriage and transgender protections. The media is not covering this transgender thing the way normal people, or sane people like myself,  a caller told Limbaugh before launching into the myth of predators using transgender protections as a shield to sexually assault women and children in bathrooms. I don t have any daughters, but I have nieces, I have teenage nieces, I have older nieces, I have a wife. This is a safety issue, this is about a predator, like the story you just read, going into these bathrooms and taking advantage of it. And it s happening, but they re not covering it. And it s really interesting how they took gun control and turned it into gun safety, but they re not treating this as a safety issue. And the sick mind of Limbaugh immediately thought of rape and how to legalize it. No, that s actually a good point. Civil rights   you could legalize rape if you called it the Civil Rights Act of 2016. Limbaugh continued, however, by whining about how much civil rights have been extended over the last few decades, especially lamenting that it now covers race, gender, and sexual orientation because he apparently believes only white straight men deserve civil rights. He also claimed it was only  a joke. So they always attach people, the reading public, the news consuming public, has been conditioned to attach the words  civil rights  to race. Now it s being expanded. Civil rights, gay marriage; civil rights, transgender bathroom rights; civil rights, whatever the left wants. Except over here, rape has become a safety issue. But over here this stuff is a civil rights   if, when you hear the left equate anything with civil rights, what you should learn is this is how they are attempting to corrupt the culture. And they re doing it under the banner of civil rights, which is supposed to shut you up. It is supposed to silence opposition, because nobody with a brain is ever supposed to violate civil rights. Never, anybody with a brain would know never to oppose anything that says  civil rights  attached to it. Which is why the joke, you could legalize whatever you want by calling it the Civil Rights Act of 2016, because nobody would have the guts to vote against it. Because if they did you d have the media, Democrats running around, saying so-and-so voted against the Civil Rights Act of 2016 denying all of our citizens equal rights, blah blah blah blah blah. Here s the audio via Media Matters.In his effort to slander Democrats, Limbaugh also claimed that  rape has become a safety issue  for conservatives. First of all, Limbaugh seems to be admitting that conservatives never cared about rape before. And second, if conservatives really believe rape is a safety issue, perhaps they should stop aiding and rewarding rapists by not forcing rape victims to carry rape pregnancies to term. Furthermore, they can repeal laws that allow rapists to seek custody and visitation rights. Or how about believing women when they say they were raped instead of saying they were asking for it.The fact is that there have been zero instances of a transgender person doing anything but using the restroom like a normal person. They certainly haven t sexually assaulted anyone. And that s throughout the 17 states and over 200 cities that have transgender protection in place. In fact, the only men who have gone into a restroom to scare women and children are the ones being purposely sent in there by the Family Research Council, a right-wing group trying to instill fear of transgender people by pretending there is a problem with them using the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity.But get ready, folks. It won t be long before a conservative lawmaker takes Limbaugh seriously like usual and literally writes a bill to legalize rape by excusing it as a civil rights issue. And the way Republicans have treated rape victims over the years, you know they are considering it.Featured image via  screenshot",0

"LONDON (Reuters) - After months of Brexit talks that have made little progress and deepened rifts in her party, British Prime Minister Theresa May will try this week to put the negotiations on track and reassert her authority.  In a speech in the Italian city of Florence, May will set out on Friday her vision for future ties with the European Union and try to fill an apparent policy vacuum that has left her Brexit team adopting what Brussels regards as wrecking tactics in the talks on unraveling four decades of union. The 60-year-old leader has deliberately chosen an EU city to deliver the speech so that she can speak directly to the other 27 nations in the bloc, but has her work cut out in seizing back the initiative. May has been largely quiet on Brexit since her Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in a June election that she need not have called, saying little beyond expressing her support for  a deep and special partnership  with the bloc once Britain leaves in March 2019. But days before the speech, foreign minister Boris Johnson laid out his own Brexit vision, challenging her more cautious approach and exposing the fault lines in her party and government. EU negotiators are also frustrated with what they see as Britain s policy drift. At talks in August, British officials spent almost three hours picking holes in the legal basis for the bill that the EU expects London to pay to leave.  Sources familiar with the presentation   so detailed it stretched for 11 pages and was illustrated with 23 slides   called it a show of legal muscle. But, as Brexit minister David Davis said, the meeting was even  tetchier than the one before .  The reason lawyers gave a two-and-a-half hour presentation is because no government minister had made a decision on policy,  said Andrew Hood, who was a legal adviser to former prime minister David Cameron and still has contact with lawyers in several government departments. The August talks were almost canceled by the EU side because of Britain s lack of position, Hood told Reuters.  I always thought when I was in the foreign office that if you ever need to revert to lawyers you ve probably lost,  he said. Hood now advises companies on their Brexit strategy for law firm Dechert but took part in meetings with the EU under Cameron, who resigned last year after Britons voted for Brexit. The financial settlement with Brussels is one of the most difficult parts of the Brexit negotiations, but the lack of movement so far on even the mechanics of how to calculate the sum shows the difficulties facing Britain. May is walking a tightrope between hardline Conservative Brexit supporters who want to make sure any payment is as small as possible, and some top ministers who believe Britain must pay to keep ties as close as possible. Until now, she has largely let her government do the talking by setting out a wishlist for future relations with the bloc that aims for the closest of ties without the costs. May has also stuck to a belief that by playing her cards close to her chest, Britain will force EU negotiators into concessions. But her silence has allowed other voices to emerge. The main opposition Labour Party says it would keep Britain in the single European market and customs union during a transitional period, the Liberal Democrats are demanding a second referendum and the Scottish National Party wants Scotland to remain part of the EU. Their opposition is to be expected, but criticism from May s own team is not, and has raised eyebrows.  In a weekend newspaper article, Johnson wrote that he did not expect Britain to pay for access to the EU s market, putting him at odds with finance minister Philip Hammond and May, who has spoken of paying in. At the August talks, left without clear policy direction, Davis and his team s detailed dissection of the EU s arguments on the Brexit bill left the bloc s main negotiator Michel Barnier wondering whether  we can build trust and start discussing a future relationship . Weeks earlier, a former aide to May had praised the emerging agreement in her cabinet over the need for a transition deal and a divorce settlement   something that seemed remote after last year s Brexit referendum.  But though there may be agreement on this in principle, the difference lies in the detail and has opened a deep rift.  Hammond wants a transition as close as possible to the status quo while others, such as trade minister Liam Fox, do not want to stay in the single market or pay for access. Pro-Brexit lawmakers have also balked at suggestions Britain should pay 60 billion euros ($72 billion) for the divorce, and May s aides have poured cold water on reports that there could be a compromise to reduce the headline figure by paying 10 billion pounds a year to the EU during a transition. In a move that appeared intended to tighten her control over the Brexit talks, May appointed the top official at the Brexit ministry as her EU adviser on Monday. But resetting the talks is a tough order, and aides are silent on whether May will use the Florence speech to try to break the deadlock on the financial settlement.  Officials in Brussels are not holding their breath.  The EU has taken the black veil off and is getting on with its life,  one EU official said after the August talks.  The Brits are either completely overconfident or completely overwhelmed.  ",1
"Has their ever been a more vengeful and hateful First Lady?They are the elite group of women who occupy the East Wing of the White House as their husbands serve as presidents of the United States.Viewed as  the true modern power brokers of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , the first ladies have had different takes on their public positions and either love the proximity to the country s top policy advisers or view it as serving a prison term of teas, luncheons, dinners and photo ops.There are friendships among this sorority of first ladies and turbulent rivalries as well as  relationships fraught with hurt feelings and resentment, like that between Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama , Kate Andersen Brower writes in her new book, First Women, the Grace and Power of America s Modern First Ladies, published by Harper. The 2008 presidential campaign left deep and lasting scars on both the Clinton and the Obama camps, and they are still shockingly fresh. Michelle, now 52, never forgot how Hillary mocked her husband s message of  hope and change  at a campaign rally in Ohio during that campaign. The sky will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing, and everyone will know that we should do the right thing, and the world would be perfect,  Clinton said.Watch Hillary starting at the 45 second mark:Hillary was right; that certainly didn t happen and she has remained bitter for years that Senator Ted Kennedy, who had been her mentor in the Senate, did not support her presidential candidacy in 2008.A source in Hillary s inner circle told the author that Hillary, now 68, is running again for president out of vengeance for that loss. She needs to win.Obama is viewed by Hillary s circle of people as not having the same work ethic as Hillary who they see as having a long record of dedicated public service.Those Clinton acolytes also suggest that  Michelle has not done enough as first lady  and has failed to prioritize funding for some programs that subsequently lost their federal support.One such program was Save America s Treasures, a program that Hillary started to help preserve and protect historic sites, arts and published works and was lovingly carried on by Laura Bush, the next first lady.Michelle felt no such obligation to those treasures and let the program dissolve.Michelle s feelings towards Hillary were blatantly obvious when no couple dinners were scheduled at the Obama White House while Hillary was secretary of state and frequently meeting with the President.Michelle is very close to Jill Biden and Vice President Joe Biden. She was hoping that Biden would run against Hillary for the Democratic nomination and his win would take away the sweet taste of victory once again for Hillary. Via: Daily Mail ",0

" (Corrects source in headline and first paragraph of Dec. 5 story; adds source in third paragraph) By Vladimir Soldatkin MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has communication channels with North Korea open and Moscow is ready to exert its influence on Pyongyang, Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov as saying on Tuesday.  We have channels, through which we are conducting a dialogue, and we are ready to deploy them, we are ready to exert our influence on North Korea,  Morgulov was quoted as saying at a conference in Berlin.      He also said that neither Washington nor Pyongyang want a real war  but such scenarios exist , according to RIA news agency. The Kremlin has traditionally protected the reclusive state though the latest Pyongyang tests have irked Moscow. North Korea, which conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test in September, has tested dozens of ballistic missiles under Kim Jong Un s leadership in defiance of international sanctions. Morgulov called for other measures than isolation to exercise in dealing with North Korea.  We believe that the isolation alone...will not work, this won t take us forward. By doing this, we will only worsen the situation, which is dangerous. We are really on the brink of a real war,  he said. In Washington, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said the Trump administration still wanted a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the nuclear and missile threat from Pyongyang but said:  (North Korea) has shown through its actions that it is not interested in talks. We must remain focused on increasing the costs for Pyongyang to continue to advance its WMD programs.  Morgulov was also quoted as saying that North Korea was seeking a direct dialogue with the United States on its nuclear program, while it was not in need of security guarantees either from China or Russia.

" Kris Kobach   For years, the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it. And when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud, we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter.New Hampshire was a must win for Hillary. Watch CNN explain the significance of winning the state of New Hampshire for Hillary: New Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that he s a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote.New Hampshire is also a battleground state. Unlike neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, which reliably vote for the Democrat in presidential elections, New Hampshire can swing either way. It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes.Now there s proof.According to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver s license to prove their identity. In and of itself, that doesn t prove that any fraud occurred   theoretically, each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the State and had not yet had time to get a New Hampshire driver s license. According to New Hampshire law, a new resident has 60 days to obtain a New Hampshire driver s license.So if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their driver s license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017   nearly ten months after the election   only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driver s license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire driver s license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire.So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driver s license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driver s licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State.5,513 is a big number   more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. That s likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds.It s also possible that New Hampshire s four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well.If the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result.   Breitbart ",0

Remember composts and how they were supposed to be great for the planet these Energy Department goofballs need to understand what happens naturally is not a bad thing. How scary are your jack-o -lanterns? Scarier than you think, according to the Energy Department, which claims the holiday squash is responsible for unleashing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Most of the 1.3 billion pounds of pumpkins produced in the U.S. end up in the trash, says the Energy Department s website, becoming part of the  more than 254 million tons of municipal solid waste produced in the United States every year.

Ok, apparently the whizkids at the Dept. of Energy need a refresher course in something called the carbon cycle. It s  settled science . You see, as every living thing grows it incorporates carbon into it s structure. That s why it s called carbon based life. Then when it dies, it releases that carbon back into the environment so some other living thing can use it to grow. Now it doesn t matter what you do with the dead thing. Whether it rots away slowly or you burn it or you convert it into some thing else that gets burned, it still releases the carbon.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - John Anderson, a former Republican congressman who challenged the party’s conservative drift by taking on its chief symbol, Ronald Reagan, and ran for president as an independent in 1980, died on Sunday. He was 95. Anderson had been ill for some time, family friend Dan Johnson told Reuters in a telephone interview. Anderson’s wife, Keke, and his daughter Diane were at his side when he died in Washington, Diane Anderson said by phone.  Anderson finished a distant third with almost 7 percent of the vote in the 1980 presidential election but gave almost 6 million voters an alternative to the conservative Reagan - who won the election - and the unpopular Democratic president, Jimmy Carter. But Anderson did not win a single precinct and political analysts said he ultimately may have contributed to Reagan’s electoral landslide by taking votes from Carter. Anderson’s first venture into politics came in 1956 when he was elected as a state attorney in Illinois. In 1960, he won the first of 10 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives running as a conservative. He later moved to the left, breaking with conservatives in 1968 by voting for a bill to outlaw racial discrimination in housing. Anderson served as chairman of the House Republican Conference for the next 10 years even as he became more critical of Republican President Richard Nixon, especially on his handling of the Vietnam War. He was one of the first Republican House members to call for Nixon’s resignation over the Watergate scandal. “He’s the smartest guy in Congress, but he insists on voting his conscience instead of party,” Republican U.S. Representative Gerald Ford, who later become president, said of Anderson in 1973. In 1980, with Carter low in the opinion polls and his administration mired in the Iran hostage crisis, many Republicans, including Anderson, jumped into the party’s presidential primaries for a chance to oppose the Democrat in the November election. Reagan, who had come close to winning the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, quickly moved to the front of the race, with his main opponent being former U.N. Ambassador George H.W. Bush. Anderson dropped out of the Republican primaries in the spring of 1980 and announced he was running as an independent. When he entered the race, he was enthusiastically greeted as an alternative to the major parties, getting around 25 percent support in at least one poll. But his poll numbers began sliding, even though he was seen as having bested Reagan in surveys after a televised debate with the Republican presidential nominee. Carter boycotted that debate and refused to face Reagan if Anderson was included. Carter finally agreed to a debate with Reagan shortly before the election, when the sponsoring League of Women Voters agreed not to invite Anderson. Four years later, Anderson’s break with conservative Republicans was complete and he supported Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, who lost to Reagan in a landslide. Born in Rockford, Illinois, on Feb. 15, 1922, Anderson was educated at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Harvard Law School. He served in the Second World War and joined the foreign service, stationed in Germany, his family said in a statement.  After his presidential defeat, Anderson became a visiting professor at various universities, wrote extensively and served on many boards including FairVote, a voting rights organization formerly known as the Center for Voting and Democracy. In the 2000 presidential election, Anderson was seen as a possible presidential candidate for the Reform Party founded by Texas billionaire Ross Perot, but he ended up endorsing Ralph Nader.	 Diane Anderson said her father believed the two-party system was broken and was appalled by what happened with the Republican Party.  “Everything he wanted to prevent unfortunately came to pass,” she said.

"Florida mom and hardcore gun nut Jamie Gilt is back in the news again after police recommended that she be charged in the incident that left her with a gunshot wound in her back.You probably all remember this idiot but if you don t, she is the pro-Second Amendment nutter who ran a Facebook page, Jamie Gilt For Gun Sense,  (it s been deleted) where she bragged about letting her 4-year-old son handle a firearm. All of her  responsible  gun owning ways came to a head earlier this month when she left her freedom extension within reach of her small son and he picked it up, shooting while she was driving.On Tuesday, Putnam County Sheriff s Capt. Gator DeLoach announced that the department is recommending she be charged for her stupidity, but their recommendation will surely piss you off.  According to CBS News:Police say they are recommending a charge of allowing a child access to a firearm.Gilt could face up to 180 days in jail, reports CBS affiliate WJAX. The State Attorney s Office will ultimately make a decision on if charges will be filed.That s right, the police think that she should only be charged with a misdemeanor even though her actions put her son in mortal danger. CBS News also reported that the Florida Department of Children and Families have opened a case, but it looks as though she still has custody of her son. This is unbelievably outrageous.At the very least Gilt should have been charged with felony child neglect. According to Florida law, felony child neglect is defined as:A caregiver s failure or omission to provide a child with the care, supervision, and services necessary to maintain the child s physical and mental health, including, but not limited to, food, nutrition, clothing, shelter, supervision, medicine, and medical services that a prudent person would consider essential for the well-being of the child.This woman left a deadly weapon within reach of her four-year-old son. Not only was it within reach, but he handled the weapon and shot her. He could have very easily shot himself and died. Thankfully, though, her dumb ass was the only person injured. Now, if that isn t a  failure to provide supervision  I have no idea what is.This woman should never be allowed to own a gun again and she should not be allowed custody of her child until she takes some very intensive parenting classes. Her refusal to practice proper gun safety almost killed that little boy, and if she walks away from this with nothing but a misdemeanor charge we will have witnessed another great injustice in the state of Florida.Featured image via CBS",0
"For the umpteenth time, Obama takes the opportunity to trash Americans while overseas President Obama on Monday pushed world leaders to finalize a sweeping global agreement that would cut carbon emissions and hopefully stave off the worst effects of climate change.Invoking the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., Obama insisted that a grim future hurt by worsening global warming  is one that we have the power to change. Right here. Right now. But only if we rise to this moment,  he said in a speech kicking off the Paris conference. For all the challenges we face, the growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other,  Obama said.  What should give us hope that this is a turning point, that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet, is the fact that our nations share a sense of urgency about this challenge and a growing realization that it is within our power to do something about it. I ve come here personally, as the leader of the world s largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it,  he added.

"Many of the parents were not allowed to attend this meeting due to capacity restrictions. Why did larger venues refuse to host this controversial meeting? Were they afraid to allow American citizens to voice their concerns about the false teachings of Islam in the public schools? Are Americans and American businesses going to cower over the fear of being targeted by radical Muslims for fighting back against the indoctrination of Islam?BRENTWOOD, Tenn.   School board members in Brentwood, Tennessee received an education on the public s frustrations with Islam lessons in local schools during a radio station sponsored town hall Wednesday.Criticisms of the middle school text  My World History and Geography  centered mostly on the omission of negative aspects of the Muslim religion, and the appropriateness of the materials for students in sixth and seventh grades, Brentwood Homepage reports.The event was sponsored by Supertalk Radio and held in a  tiny room  at a Holiday Inn Express, where about 70 folks   including students, parents, teachers, lawmakers, school board members, and political pundits   huddled inside. Organizers reportedly turned some people away when the room reached capacity.Sunset Middle School seventh-grader Avery Noe pointed out during the meeting that lessons  exclude jihadist from Islam  and questioned why negative aspects of the religion aren t covered.Stewart County middle school teacher Kyle Mallory said teachers cover the materials they re given, focusing on what s expected on standardized tests, and asserted the issue with biased lessons on Islam stem from the state s textbook selection process. Mallory teaches in a different school district that rejected the  My World History and Geography  text, Fox 17 reports. Y all had a school board member from here come up to the textbook commission,  he said.  Nothing was done. It s not a teacher problem. We have (a state education) commissioner not doing her job, and I think the state legislature needs a no-confidence resolution. Mallory told Fox 17 the  My World History  text is  very biased, didn t tell the whole story. We need to make sure when we re teaching students in the classroom that we tell them the truth and the textbooks weren t,  Mallory said.Williamson County School Board member Beth Burgos told the Brentwood Homepage she joined the board because of textbook issues, and she backs a recent bill introduced by state Rep. Shelia Butt to postpone comparative religion courses until high school.Board member Susan Curlee believes the key to changing the way Islam is presented in schools, and to preventing unintentional indoctrination, lies with standardized tests. My biggest concern is testing,  she said.  When my daughter was in seventh grade, I was told they didn t want to teach Islam that way, but had to because 25 percent of the test was going to focus on Islam. As long as testing is the accountability metric, it could be this way. Curlee told Fox 17 the lessons her daughter learned about Islam while in Franklin Special School District last year presented a rosy picture of the religion, while glossing over important points. A lot of the things we hear about Mohammed and a lot of the warfare that was waged is very much sugar coated,  she said. My World History,  which is used by about 40 Tennessee school districts, also alleges Islam spreads peacefully, and that Christians and Muslims worship the same God. My concern is, are we going to be asking students on a test to potentially compromise their faith for the sake of a grade?  Curlee said.Tennessee state Sen. Jack Johnson, who also attended the town hall, told the Brentwood Homepage a lot of people share Curlee s concerns. I m concerned because I have three kids in Williamson County Schools,  Johnson said.  The possibility we could be advocating Islam in school and could be misrepresenting history had generated lots of calls and emails. I want to educate myself and learn more about it. Event organizers told the media they were forced to hold the town hall in the small Holiday Inn Express room because larger venues in the area refused to host the discussion. Via: EAG News",0

"The Clinton Foundation has confirmed it accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar while Hillary Clinton was U.S. secretary of state without informing the State Department, even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments.Qatari officials pledged the money in 2011 to mark the 65th birthday of Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton s husband, and sought to meet the former U.S. president in person the following year to present him the check, according to an email from a foundation official to Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email, among thousands hacked from Podesta s account, was published last month by WikiLeaks.Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family s globe-straddling foundation in order to become secretary of state in 2009. The agreement was designed to increase transparency to avoid appearances that U.S. foreign policy could be swayed by wealthy donors.If a new foreign government wished to donate or if an existing foreign-government donor, such as Qatar, wanted to  increase materially  its support of ongoing programs, Clinton promised that the State Department s ethics official would be notified and given a chance to raise any concerns.Clinton Foundation officials last month declined to confirm the Qatar donation.Read more: Breitbart",0
"As anyone who remotely follows the news knows, media whore Hillary has been dying for a reason to appear in photos unrelated to a story about her criminal activities. True to form, Hillary capitalizes on the birth of Chelsea s campaign baby by standing alone and waving to the crowd how very  grandmotherly .You won t see the other set of grandparents in any pictures however, as the royal Clinton family has banned their son-in-laws family from appearing in any pictures with them Chelsea Clinton has emerged from hospital for the first time with her newborn son Aidan.The former First Daughter beamed at cameras on the steps of New York s Lenox Hill Hospital on Monday, flanked by her husband Marc Mezvinsky and parents Bill and Hillary Clinton.Despite the soaring temperatures, Hillary wore a button-down coat, while Chelsea opted for a floral mini-dress.Aidan, Chelsea s second child with husband Marc Mezvinsky, was born on Saturday in the $1,700-a-night maternity ward.- DMWho is Chelsea Clinton s father-in-law and why are he and his wife banned from appearing in pictures with Crooked Queen Hillary and her sexual predator husband? Edward Maurice  Ed  Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton s father-in-law and her daughter s grandfather, is a convicted Felon. The former Democrat Congressman from Iowa s 1st Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives, served two terms, from 1973 to 1977.Ed Mezvinsky has known Hillary Clinton since the days when he served on the House Judiciary Committee that decided the fate of President Richard Nixon. This harsh critic of President Richard Nixon, had called Nixon  a crook  and  a disgrace to politics and the nation , and called for Nixon s impeachment.But, did you ever wonder who that allusive  Nigerian Prince  is who might be sending you those emails looking for money? Look no farther than the Clinton Family Tree.Through a series of Nigerian email scams and Ponzi schemes, Ed Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton s father-in-law embezzled more than $10 million dollars. In 2001, Ed Mezvinsky was convicted of 31 (out of 69!) charges of fraud, and served five years in federal prison. His fraud charges included bank, mail, wire, as well as other offenses involving financing bogus oil development and other trade deals in Africa.But don t think Ed doesn t keep it in the family. In addition to his law clients and friends, he even bilked his own (now deceased) mother-in-law out of money. To date in 2015, the Fraudster still owes over $9.4 million in restitution to his victims.A lot of political pundits have made allusions to the fact that the Clintons  and the Mezvinkys  behaviors are so similar, that it is what bonded the two. Be that as it may, the Clintons go to great lengths to never, ever, be seen or photographed with any of Chelsea s in-laws. So afraid is the Clinton Dynasty of being tarnished by the Mezvinkys that neither Ed nor his second wife and Marc s mother, Marjorie Sue Margolies-Mezvinsky, were allowed in any of Chelsea s wedding pictures.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Environmentally conscious investors are using their pocketbooks to protest President Donald Trump’s plans to slash environmental regulations, fueling a rally in funds that only invest in companies that meet progressive criteria for sustainability. From the start of November to the end of January, investors poured $1.8 billion into actively managed equities funds in the “socially responsible” category, according to Lipper data. In the same period, there was a net outflow of $133 billion from funds that do not have environmental or social mandates. Trump was elected president on Nov. 8. Investors worried that Trump’s policies may imperil causes they believe in are hoping an influx of flows will help keep companies alive. “If clients see the federal government withdrawing from a space they think is important, they may actually be more active in wanting to enforce their views through the dollars allocated,” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon Asset Management. The inflows are a boon for fund managers but also a challenge, requiring them to find companies whose share prices have a chance to climb despite less favorable federal policies. For instance, shares of solar energy companies took a beating after the election, sliding 11 percent by year end on concerns the future of U.S. tax credits under a Trump administration, though they have recovered somewhat since then. Still, cautious fund managers from Fidelity, New Alternatives, Calvert Investments and others are scrutinizing water technology and wind power shares, which should benefit from new federal infrastructure spending and a push by states such as California toward more renewable power generation. Managers say water technology stocks should see an uptick from Trump’s campaign promise to spend $1 trillion on repairing and improving the country’s infrastructure. Wind stocks are attractive as that energy source is proving more cost-effective in growing areas of the country like California, which plans to get half its energy from renewable sources by 2030.  “If you look at where the policy is changing the fastest, it’s at the state level, and we see places like California continuing on that trend regardless of what is happening on the federal level,” said Kevin Walenta, who manages the Fidelity Select Environment and Alternative Energy portfolio. He has been adding to his positions in Spanish wind energy company Iberdrola SA and US-based water and plumbing company Comfort Systems USA Inc. Trump has not yet called for ending tax credits for solar and other renewable energy, though he has expressed doubt about the role of solar energy, bemoaned the loss of coal-mining jobs and blamed wind turbines for ruining picturesque landscapes. Ahead of the election, power companies had already started to pivot away from solar and invest more in wind, with companies including Southern Co, NextEra Energy Inc and Xcel Energy Inc announcing plans to expand wind-generating capabilities at a time when technology has helped lower its cost. [L1N1FZ1GR].  Wind power costs average between $32 and $62 per megawatt hour before subsidies, compared with an average between $49 and $61 per megawatt hour for utility-scale solar arrays without subsidies, according to a December 2016 report from Lazard. Coal power, which Trump has pledged to revive, costs between $60 and $143 per megawatt hour, the report notes. With that cost structure, along with the potential increase in jobs from building and maintaining wind turbines, even solidly Republican states should continue to invest in renewables, said Murray Rosenblith, co-portfolio manager of the New Alternatives Fund. Rosenblith has been adding to his positions in wind companies Vestas Wind Systems and Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA, both of whose shares are up 10 percent or more since the start of the year. “These are growing industries in states that are bringing back jobs,” he said. “Even if Trump wants to pull tax credits back as a political gesture he’s not going to find a lot of support in the party at large.” ",1
"Ever since the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the investigation into Russia s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and the subsequent appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Donald Trump has been attempting to find a way to get rid of Mueller and shut down the investigation. Since he doesn t have the power to fire Mueller directly, Trump has been gunning for a way to have an Attorney General installed who will do his bidding. It is the reason for his constant public humiliation of Sessions, and for his constantly calling the entire probe into his campaign s possible collusion with Russia a  witch hunt  and a  hoax.  Well, it seems that the United States Senate has had enough.Senators have been worried that Trump would fire Sessions and appoint a loyal toady in his place during the August recess without Senate confirmation. Therefore, they have decided to hold what are called pro-forma sessions during the recess to handcuff Trump s ability to appoint anyone to any positions without the approval of the majority of the United States Senate. These sessions are nothing more than having a member of the majority to preside briefly every three days during the recess, so that the Senate is technically in session. This keeps Trump from being able to do anything regarding whatever loyalists he may appoint to whatever position.This all comes on the heels of Special Counsel Mueller impaneling a grand jury with regards to the Russia investigation. Trump can t be happy, and will likely begin attacking Senators on Twitter once he learns what has just happened to his plans to fire Mueller before anyone around him can be indicted.This action on the part of the Senate should come as no surprise, though, as Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has already warned Trump that he will absolutely not confirm a new Attorney General if Trump decides to fire Sessions.What s next, pre-emptive pardons? Something tells me that at this rate, the Senate will have an answer for that as well.Featured image via Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images",0
"RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - A U.S. law allowing lawsuits against Saudi Arabia over the Sept. 11 attacks met a stony silence from Riyadh on Thursday but some Saudis bristled, saying the kingdom should curb business and security ties in response. The Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the United States to seek damages from the Saudi government. Riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of Islamist militant group al Qaeda. Fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.  The Saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the “Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act”, or JASTA, in the run-up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity. But Saudi officials who had lobbied against the bill stopped short of threatening any retaliation if the law was passed. There was no official reaction from Saudi Arabia after the votes, and in the short-term, few expect little more than a curt statement of disapproval from Riyadh. The long-standing alliance between the kingdom and the United States is one of the cornerstones of Middle East politics, security and trade, and in their reactions on Thursday some Saudis said JASTA would jeopardize what they see as an interdependent relationship.   “What would happen if Saudi Arabia froze its cooperation with the United States with regards to counter-terrorism as a response to JASTA?” Salman al-Dosary, editor-in-chief of the pan-Arab, Saudi-owned Al Sharq al-Awsat newspaper, wrote on Twitter. The Saudi riyal fell against the U.S. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on Thursday after the bill was passed, prompting a drop in dollar demand in Riyadh. “People are reluctant to buy dollars ... because of the price,” said Raed al-Sayari, whose family runs an exchange shop in a bustling commercial district popular with foreign workers. “We’re concerned that if the dollar keeps appreciating and the situation doesn’t stabilize in the coming days there will be no demand. This would be a big loss for the market.” The Saudi riyal SAR= is pegged at 3.75 to the dollar in the spot market, but banks often use the forwards market to hedge against risks. Some analysts argue the Al Saud ruling family will interpret the move as political expedience by lawmakers in a U.S. election season and that the chances of a successful lawsuit are uncertain at best. But the measure does nothing to ease long-standing friction in the alliance: President Barack Obama, who had vetoed JASTA but was overridden by Congress, is increasingly seen by the kingdom and fellow Gulf Arab as favoring their bitter rival Iran, a charge Washington denies, and differs with Riyadh over Syria and other Arab crises. “This bill reflects an anti-Saudi campaign. It is time to see less of America in our midst,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political scientist in the United Arab Emirates. Some analysts have speculated that Riyadh could retaliate by curbing U.S. trade with the biggest Arab economy or restrict cooperation on security, a crucial relationship for U.S. counter-terrorism and for peace efforts in Arab conflicts. Theodore Karasik, of Gulf State Analytics, wrote on al Arabiya website that JASTA would “ignite a firestorm of legal warfare that will directly undermine political relationships at a time when robust ties to fight terrorism is required”. He said the measure could also disrupt sweeping economic reforms meant to boost the private sector and foreign investment and wean the kingdom off oil dependence.  Some analysts speculated that bilateral trade and investment could be hurt. The kingdom owns $96.5 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds, and is believed to hold at least that sum in other U.S. assets and bank accounts. ",1
"Because there s totally nothing else better for the Trump administration to do, it s about to crack down on marijuana users. Attorney General Jeff Sessions won t find much support from voters on this as support to legalize marijuana has risen to an all time high.Sessions leads the amateur president s Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety which is expected to release a report next week. Critics are concerned that the report will try to link weed to violent crime and recommend tougher sentences. And there is no link to violent crime and smoking weed.The Hill reports:Sessions sent a memo in April updating the U.S. Attorney s Offices and Department of Justice Department (DOJ) component heads on the work of the task force, which he said would be accomplished through various subcommittees. In the memo, Sessions said he has asked for initial recommendations no later than July 27. Task Force subcommittees will also undertake a review of existing policies in the areas of charging, sentencing, and marijuana to ensure consistency with the Department s overall strategy on reducing violent crime and with Administration goals and priorities,  he wrote.Clearly, critics aren t wrong to be concerned of Sessions implementing tougher sentences for smoking weed. The task force revolves around reducing violent crime and Sessions and other DOJ officials have been out there over the last month and explicitly the last couple of weeks talking about how immigration and marijuana increases violent crime,  Inimai Chettiar, the director of the Brennan Center s Justice Program said.Sessions is going after weed, you know, because the  war on drugs  worked out so well last time.Back in May, he penned a letter to Congressional leaders. I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict the discretion of the Department to fund prosecutions, particularly in the midst of an historic drug epidemic and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime,  Sessions wrote in the letter.We re not sure what weed has to do with the opioid epidemic sweeping across America, a problem which the Trump administration has failed to address.On Wednesday, Sessions managed to outrage both Democrats and Republicans with his controversial plans to increase civil asset forfeiture.Local law enforcement leaders don t feel that a crackdown is necessary. From a practitioner s point of view, marijuana is not a drug that doesn t have some danger to it, but it s not the drug that s driving violent crime in America,  said Ronal Serpas, the former superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department who co-chairs Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration. That s not the drug with which we see so much death and destruction on the streets of America. Crack and powdered cocaine, heroin and opioids is where we re seeing people die on street corners fighting over territory or control,  he added.The states rights issue that Republicans have vigorously touted seems to go against what Sessions is about to do.While on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to leave marijuana legalization up to the states but he appears to have flip-flopped on that issue, too.Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images.",0

"There are two things anyone with familiarity with Fox News host Sean Hannity learns quickly: He is one of the most unlikable people working in television and he is really, really sensitive about it.On Wednesday, Hannity managed to exemplify both of those traits when he learned that Politico reporter Marc Caputo quoted a Marco Rubio staffer as calling Hannity a  f*cking a**hole.  Rather than take the high road or, better yet, analyze his own actions to figure out why people despise him, Hannity did what comes naturally to him: He threw a very public, very embarrassing temper tantrum.Here s what Caputo said, quoted from an anonymous Rubio staffer, that set Hannity off: ""But Marco gives Donald a taste of his own medicine and Hannity gets all offended. He's a pussy and a sellout."" Boy, they're angry 2/2  Marc Caputo (@MarcACaputo) March 2, 2016Crass? Sure. Accurate? Definitely. It s no secret that Hannity has been a big fan of Donald Trump s since the very beginning. He once bragged that he encouraged Trump to get into the presidential race in 2012. He s been a major cheerleader ever since. In February, Trump was facing serious accusations about courting white supremacists   so he booked a 30 minute softball interview with his friend Hannity and  the issue never even came up. Instead, the two shared some laughs, complimented each other, and generally behaved as if it was a Trump 2016 infomercial paid for by Fox News.So when it came to defending his reputation against this charge of favoritism, Hannity simply ignored his indefensible actions and lashed out. Hilariously, Hannity didn t blame Rubio s campaign staffer so much as the reporter who relayed the message. On Twitter, the conservative pundit went a bit nuts.He tried  I know you are, but what am I? Glad Politico let's u use such big words that accurately describes yourself asshole. And u r ""impartial"" to politics https://t.co/bCn2UL8wc0  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 2, 2016He tried blaming it on liberals.Typical lib media, u missed my point.

In 2014, Mediaite ran a survey asking  several dozen cable news hosts from Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC  what they felt about their fellow pundits. Hannity was overwhelmingly voted worst (even by his own co-workers). He didn t take it well.@TheMattWilstein Lets do the BEST OF MEDIAITE CONCHA. ALL THE REST OF U MEDIAMATTERS WANNABEES SUCK IMHO . #badge of honor  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) December 22, 2014And just like his latest tantrum, Hannity blamed the messenger. Mediaite didn t decide who the  best of  Fox News was, Fox News hosts did   and they all said they didn t like Hannity. Likewise, Politico s Caputo didn t call Hannity a  f*cking a**hole , Rubio s campaign did.Hannity may have  14 million radio listeners  from the bitter clingin  proud clingers set, but he gets absolutely no respect from his fellow media personalities. Even the peers at his own network see through his hack journalism and abrasive personality. And they have a right to be mad. Every time Sean Hannity runs a doe-eyed fluff piece on Trump, it reminds us that Fox News is shamelessly enabling Trump s rise to power. And when you are the guy with 14 million fans who is cheerleading a bigot like Trump, it makes you a f*cking a**hole.Featured image via Fox News screengrab",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday criticized Facebook Inc (FB.O) as “anti-Trump” and questioned its role during the 2016 presidential campaign, amid probes into alleged Russian interference in the election and possible collusion by Trump’s associates. His salvo came as the social media giant prepares to hand over 3,000 political ads to congressional investigators that it has said were likely purchased by Russian entities during and after last year’s presidential contest. Trump appeared to embrace the focus on the social media network in his comments on Wednesday, which also took aim at more traditional medial outlets, long targeted by the president as “fake news.” “Facebook was always anti-Trump. The networks were always anti-Trump,” Trump said on Twitter, levelling the same charge against the New York Times and the Washington Post. “Collusion?” Representatives for Facebook and the newspapers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s tweet. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is among those investigating Russia’s role, said he expected to have the ads by next week and that they should be made public. “You really need to see them ... to recognise how cynical an effort this was by the Kremlin, how they sought to just accentuate those divisions ... and drive American against American,” Schiff told MSNBC, adding that Facebook and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) executives should testify publicly about the issue. “I have concerns about how long it took Facebook to realise the Russians were advertising on their network,” Schiff told MSNBC, adding that he has spoken several times with the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.  Facebook and other technology companies are coming under increased scrutiny amid the Russia investigations. The probes, being conducted by several congressional committees along with the Department of Justice, have clouded Trump’s tenure since taking office in January and threatened his agenda, which has yet to secure a major legislative victory.  Moscow has denied any collusion. Trump himself has previously praised Facebook and credited it with helping him win the November election. His campaign has said it spent some $70 million on Facebook ads, and it also ran  a live Facebook show.  His latest comments did not appear to affect shares of the company, which were up 1.4 percent at $166.50 a share in late morning trading after analysts raised their price target for the stock. ",1
"As much as Jeronimo Yanez, the police officer who killed Philando Castile, wants to claim he didn t pull over Castile s vehicle because of race, audio from police dispatch that night tells a very different story.According to Castile s girlfriend Diamond Reynolds, in the livestream video she took that night, they were pulled over because of broken tail light. However, after revealing that he was legally carrying a firearm, but then reaching for his wallet to show identification, the officer panicked and shot Castile several times.The St. Anthony Police Officer claims that he shot Castile because of  the presence of that gun and the display of that gun,  which still has yet to be determined, but why the car was pulled over in the first place seems a lot more clear after listening to the audio from dispatch.Officer Yanez says: I m gonna stop a car. I m gonna check IDs. I have reason to pull it over. Then he says: The two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery. The driver looks more like one of our suspects, just  cause of the wide set nose. It was a minute and a half later when shots rang out and Castile died from his injuries in front of his girlfriend and his girlfriend s daughter. All because Castile  looks  a certain way according to the cop who killed him.This isn t okay, and justice needs to be served.Listen to the police dispatch audio here:Here s a portion of the #PhilandoCastile dispatch call released by #KARE11 pic.twitter.com/4J5TzVcLUk  BallerAlert (@balleralert) July 10, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",0
"What many people have been predicting throughout the course of this election may be starting to come to fruition, but it s still early, so nothing is for certain.What s that prediction? That Republicans help Hillary Clinton win by voting for her over Donald Trump.According to TargetSmart, who is known for their political data, Clinton has an eight point lead in Florida among early voters.BREAKING: @_TargetSmart/@williamandmary FL poll: HRC 48   DJT 40Early voters from FL SoS: 55   38Likely voters, haven't voted yet: 42   43  TargetSmart (@_TargetSmart) November 2, 2016Tom Bonier, TargetSmart CEO, appeared on The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell on MSNBC to share the news of this polling. The most surprising finding being that Clinton has 28% of registered Republican voters voting for her.Bonier said: We see this race as an eight point spread in favor of Secretary Clinton. 48-40. Which really is challenging the conventional wisdom of what we ve seen so far. I will say, in what we re seeing, as been noted on your show and elsewhere on the network, a lot of the vote in Florida has already been cast and elsewhere. As of this morning, over 3.6 million votes have been cast, and so, what s unique about this survey is our ability to actually poll people who have voted and see where they are. There s been a lot of analysis of who s voted by party, but really no sense given of how they re voting.Really what s fueling, honestly, this somewhat surprising eight percent margin for Secretary Clinton is the fact that she s performing incredibly strongly with registered Republican voters. So, what we re seeing in this survey is winning 28% of registered Republicans who have already cast a ballot in Florida. This certainly doesn t look too good for Trump, but it s still early and the election is still a week a way, so who s really to know. BUT it s definitely looking good for Clinton thus far.

Putin, 65, said earlier this month he would run for re-election as a self-nominated candidate, in a contest he seems sure to win comfortably, extending his grip on power into a third decade. Speaking at an annual gathering of United Russia, Medvedev said the party was Putin s party, and his key political resource. Medvedev promised it would support Putin in the election, which is scheduled for March 18.   We will give you, Vladimir Vladimirovich, all possible support, now and in the future,  said Medvedev, addressing  Putin by his first and patronymic names. Putin has been in power since 2000 either as president or prime minister.  If he wins what would be a fourth presidential term, he will be eligible to serve another six years until 2024, when he turns 72. Putin thanked Medvedev for the support and announced some goals for the future, such as higher economic growth and better healthcare.  We need to achieve a long-range steady increase in real incomes of citizens, to increase pensions and social support,  he said.  ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mick Mulvaney, White House budget chief and acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), said on Monday he has no intention of firing Leandra English, who had attempted to block him from taking control of the agency. Former CFPB head Richard Cordray had named English to lead the bureau following his resignation last month, but that appointment had been mired in turmoil after U.S. President Donald Trump had assigned Mulvaney to the same role. A U.S. District Court judge last week sided with Trump, saying the law gave Mulvaney the right to lead the consumer finance watchdog, but English is challenging the decision. During a news briefing at the CFPB on Monday, Mulvaney told reporters he would “absolutely not” consider firing English and that he would like her to continue to serve as deputy director but had not had any direct contact with her. English could not immediately be reached for comment through her lawyer, Deepak Gupta. Since arriving at the CFPB, Mulvaney has implemented a hiring freeze and suspended all new regulations for 30 days. On Monday, he said he was also reviewing more than 100 pending enforcement actions, including litigation as well as private settlement talks and investigations.  He declined to comment on specific cases, but said there were two litigation actions he has asked to delay and separately cited the CFPB’s case against mortgage company PHH Corp (PHH.N) as one that “has issues” without elaborating.  The budget chief said data security was also a top priority and that he had instructed the bureau to stop collecting personally identifiable information until data security problems highlighted by the bureau’s independent audit office had been addressed. Mulvaney this week brought in Republican congressional lawyer Brian Johnson as a senior adviser and plans to quickly bring on board more political hires to help him review the bureau’s existing and pending regulations, the budget chief said.   “Then I’m going to get down to the weeds of something I enjoy which is the budget, and how the agency ... is funded, how it’s structured, personnel, those types of things,” he added. Trump “wants to move expeditiously” on naming a permanent replacement but the Senate confirmation process is likely to take some time and Mulvaney expects to be in the interim role for up to seven months, he said in an interview Reuters. English is expected to formally file a preliminary injunction against Mulvaney and Trump this week, according to court filings.  ",1
"LONDON (Reuters) - A giant mural of Donald Trump locked in a kiss with former London mayor Boris Johnson in the style of a legendary Soviet-era image has been unveiled by a group campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union. Painted on the side of a building in Bristol, southwest England - home of the celebrated graffiti artist Banksy - the image reprises a 1979 photograph of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and East German President Erich Honecker kissing, which was later turned into a mural on the Berlin Wall.  It was commissioned by pro-EU campaign group “We are Europe” as what they call a warning of things to come if Britons vote to leave the 28-member bloc on June 23, as advocated by both Johnson and Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate in November’s U.S. presidential election. Johnson is the “Out” campaign’s best-known leader and Trump has said Britain would be “better off without” the EU, which he has blamed for Europe’s migration crisis. The 15-foot (4.5 meter) mural is accompanied by the slogan “Not #IN for this?” and a plea for people, especially the young, to register to vote by a June 7 deadline. “People need to look at this image and think - is this the future I want,” said Harriet Kingaby, a spokesperson from We Are Europe. Galvanizing the youth vote is a key issue for the “In” camp. Surveys show young people are far more likely to be in favor of remaining in the EU but also much less likely to bother to vote. A survey of 2,000 students this month found that 63 percent did not know the exact date of the referendum, while 54 percent were not aware it was being held in June. ",1
" (Editors note: Attention to language in paragraph 30 that may be offensive to some readers) By Jason Szep ELLSWORTH, Maine (Reuters) - “He lies,” huffed Janet Foster. “And he’s a dirty old man,” chimed in her sister Jean as they discussed Donald Trump’s flaws a few days before he was elected the new president of the United States. “Well, I am with him,” their brother Paul, 60, interjected, raising his voice over snacks of cheese, muffins and crackers in the family’s living room. “Hillary Clinton is like a puppet - you know it’s all scripted.” The 2016 U.S. election was unprecedented in the way it turned Americans against each other, according to dozens of interviews in rural United States and across some of the most politically charged battleground states.  It divided families like the Fosters in rural Ellsworth, Maine, broke up friendships and turned neighbor against neighbor. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, 15 percent of respondents said they had stopped talking to a family member or close friend as a result of the election. For Democrats, this shoots up to 23 percent, compared to 10 percent for Republicans. And 12 percent had ended a relationship because of it. There was no comparative polling data from previous elections. But interviews with relationship counselors and voters suggest this election stood out by summoning passions, anger and a divisiveness in ways that will make healing difficult after Clinton’s loss to Trump on Tuesday. Sarah Guth, a Democrat in Colorado, says her father - an ardent supporter of Trump - no longer speaks with her after they clashed on Facebook over their political views. “He crossed a line,” she said. After attending a Trump rally, Guth wrote on Facebook that she saw 10 minorities among thousands of people. “I’m increasingly convinced that this election is about race,” she wrote. “I mean a fear among the white majority that their rule is coming to an end.” Some posters told her “to go to hell,” she recalled in an interview. “And then my dad very publicly attacked me, telling me that I should be ashamed of myself.” The two have not spoken since. Ty Turner-Bond, a 35-year-old black man in North Carolina, says he lost friends because of his support for Trump. Some called him an “Uncle Tom,” a slur for African Americans accused of deferring to white people; others threatened violence. In Springfield, a city on Ohio’s Mad River, Duke Level, 57, voted for Trump because he wanted “a wrecking ball” to hit Washington. The owner of Un Mundo Cafe isn’t surprised this election created divisions, and he fears they could get worse. “This is one of those crossroads crisis moments in history,” he said.  Hours earlier, Trump rallied about 5,000 supporters a few miles away in a dirt-floored livestock arena. He blasted Clinton as “the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency,” drawing chants of “lock her up,” as well as a few of “string her up.” Down the street, Richard Scott, 51, an African-American supporting Clinton, shook his head when told of those chants. Those words, he said, recalled 20th Century lynchings of black Americans - including in Springfield where a black prisoner was shot and hung from a pole on Main Street in 1904. “It’s terrible,” he said. Weeks ago, he planted a Clinton sign in his yard. His neighbors put up Trump signs. Outside the funeral home he owns, a pro-Clinton sign was defaced with a “Hillary for Prison” sticker. “People are tense,” said Scott. The election hardened an already-clear racial divide in the former industrial city of 60,000 people - a snapshot of America at about 75 percent white and 18 percent black. Interviews with residents suggested its northern areas, mostly affluent and white, would vote for Trump, while its mostly black, lower-income southern section would largely support Clinton. “There is a division in this town, economically and racial. And we saw that in this election,” said Bob Leath, 58, owner of Buckeye PC Repair who voted for Trump to “clean house” in Washington. “If you voted for Clinton, you were most likely either young, lower-income or from the south side of the area.” For some, the tensions reach the bedroom. Sam Nail, a Cincinnati marriage counselor, said he has two couples who cited the election season as a “stressor” in their relationship. Much of the anger gets uncorked on social media and will be hard to undo. Some is well publicized. National Review writer David French has written about “an unending torrent of abuse” he and his family faced online from white nationalist Trump supporters, including a Tweeted image of his 7-year-old daughter’s face in a gas chamber. Others are less well known, like Brenda Thomas’ tangles with her older brother on Facebook. She says her brother unleashed a daily stream of Facebook posts on Clinton and President Barack Obama that she found objectionable. She said when her husband, a Republican, tried to reason with him, he was “unfriended” on Facebook. “I feel that I have to walk on eggshells with him and it causes problems at family functions,” said Thomas, 63, of Elizabethtown, Kentucky.   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Karen Wilson, describes this election as “stressful” on Facebook. “I’ve got family members who are mad at me for deleting entire Facebook threads when I thought they were becoming too negative. I’ve deleted Facebook friends who I realized I never should have been friends with in the first place,” said Wilson, 43.  Fourteen percent of respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they had blocked a family member or close friend from social media because of the election. For Democrats, this rises to 23 percent compared to 8 percent for Republicans. The divisions tore into the fabric of some communities. In Provo, Utah, Trump supporter Loy Brunson awoke on an October morning to find his car spray-painted with the words “AmeriKKKa” - a reference to “KKK” white supremacists - and “Fuck Trump.” His two Trump yard signs were destroyed. “So I doubled down, got motivated and put up 85 signs in my yard,” he said. Within days, all but six of those were stolen. “This was more than vandalism,” he said in an interview. “This was a free speech attack.” Some blame the divisiveness on campaign rhetoric that inflamed racial, ethnic and class tensions that have long simmered in America. Angry and extremist language moved into the mainstream.  George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at University of California, Berkeley, blames Trump’s use of language, which he ranks as among the most violent of any candidate in modern times. He specifically notes Trump’s suggestion in August that gun rights activists could take matters into their own hands if Clinton defeated him, as well as the New York businessman’s comments that she should go to prison. “When you have extremes of that order, you have extremes of anger, extremes of fear,” Lakoff said. In Mississippi, Chad Scott, an activist in the Clay County Republican Party, fears a post-election split between the party’s working-class Trump supporters and business-minded elites - a sentiment echoed in Maine, where Foster, the Ellsworth resident at odds with his sisters, witnessed the election’s political vitriol first hand.  Foster’s van was one of 20 vehicles spray-painted outside a Trump rally on Oct. 15 in the city of Bangor. And across Ellsworth, pro-Trump yard signs were stolen almost as fast as they were planted, Republican officials say.  Foster worries about the divisions ahead.  “My sisters will forgive me for my political views,” he said.  “But the country is going to be on fire.” ",1

Megyn Kelly is her usual Trump bashing self in this Sneak Peek of her interview with The Donald: ,0
"CINCINNATI (Reuters) - Liberal Elizabeth Warren attacked Republican Donald Trump on Monday during her first campaign appearance with U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, calling him an “insecure money grubber” who is driven by greed and hate.  Warren, a leader of the Democratic Party’s progressive wing and a potential vice presidential pick, said Clinton had spent her career fighting for liberal values while Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, was focused on boosting his bottom line. The U.S. senator from Massachusetts appeared with Clinton before a raucous, enthusiastic crowd in Cincinnati, Ohio, targeting a battleground state in a potential preview of a Clinton-Warren campaign team. She repeatedly accused Trump of looking out for himself instead of for average Americans. “When Donald Trump says he’ll make America great, he means make it even greater for rich guys just like Donald Trump,” Warren said, standing shoulder to shoulder with a cheering Clinton. Clinton has struggled to win over some liberal backers of rival Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont, since beating him for the Democratic nomination this month. She hopes the support of Warren can help her in that effort as she campaigns against Trump for the Nov. 8 election. Warren, who has vigorously attacked Trump in recent weeks, called him “a small, insecure money grubber who fights for no one but himself” and warned: “He will crush you into the dirt to get whatever he wants. That’s who he is.” The capacity crowd repeatedly roared its approval, and a line of supporters who could not get inside stretched out the door and down the street. At one point, Warren stopped her speech to turn and applaud Clinton, a former secretary of state. “She knows what it takes to beat a thin-skinned bully who is driven by greed and hate,” said Warren, known for calling for reining in Wall Street and eradicating income inequality. WARREN ‘A SELLOUT’ - TRUMP In a statement, Trump called Warren “a sellout” for backing Clinton, who has taken donations from Wall Street interests and once backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Asian trade deal. Clinton has since reversed her trade stance. In an interview with NBC News, Trump called Warren “a fraud” and “a racist,” accusing her of making up claims about her Native American heritage to advance her career. He again called Warren “Pocahontas,” the name of a 17th-century Native American figure, to draw attention to a controversy first raised during Warren’s 2012 Senate race in Massachusetts. “She is one of the least productive senators in the United States Senate,” Trump told NBC. “We call her Pocahontas for a reason.” Two other potential Clinton vice presidential picks - U.S. senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio - rejected Trump’s assertion and defended Warren’s record. “That’s what he does, he attacks people. He acts like he’s attacking their character - he’s attacking his own character when he does that,” Brown told Reuters. “You can’t believe anything Donald Trump says. Period,” Kaine told Reuters. Taking the microphone in Ohio, Clinton said she liked Warren’s aggressive approach to her Republican rival, who has sprayed rivals and critics with insults throughout his campaign. “I just love how she gets under Donald Trump’s skin,” Clinton said. Clinton’s decision to campaign with Warren for the first time in Cincinnati, a city on Ohio’s southwestern border with Kentucky and Indiana, underscored the swing state’s vital role in the November showdown with Trump. Ohio has backed every successful presidential nominee since 1964 and no Republican has won the White House without carrying the state.     Warren’s calls to rein in corporate excess could resonate with two groups Clinton must court in the election - Sanders supporters and those anxious about the economy who are drawn to Trump’s promise to toss out international trade deals. Ohio’s manufacturing base has taken a hit in recent economic slowdowns, and Trump has identified it as a state where his anti-free trade rhetoric could resonate with alienated blue-collar voters. Since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, Clinton has repeatedly tried to portray businessman Trump as fundamentally unfit for the presidency. Clinton said Warren’s long history of fighting for progressive economic values made her a perfect messenger for that critique. ",1
"If cities want to try and help their workers get paid sick leave, the Arizona state government will punish them with harmful budget cuts.Most sane people agree that it makes sense for workers to have paid sick leave. After all, who wants to eat food prepared by a worker who has the flu but came to work anyway because they can t afford to take an unpaid day off?The minimum wage in Arizona is $8.05 an hour, one of the lowest in the nation. And of course, Arizona is controlled by Republicans who couldn t give a flying f*ck if their citizens are so underpaid that they have to go to work sick or risk not being able to pay the rent that month.Cities once attempted to raise the minimum wage for workers, but Arizona Republicans shut them down with a law forbidding them to do so. But the people got pissed and overturned the law via referendum, which angered Republicans so much that they tried to pass another law limiting minimum wage. You know, because serfs shouldn t be able to rise up against feudal lords. But once again, the people of Arizona got the law struck down in court which has caused Republicans to hold a grudge against the peasants ever since.So when Tempe, Arizona made an effort to pass a mandatory paid sick leave law, Arizona Republicans in the state legislature reacted immediately to make sure big corporations don t have to pay a cent to help the workers who work so hard to make the company rich.Bloomberg reports:Arizona s House passed a bill on March 1 specifying that cities aren t allowed to require private employers to provide paid sick leave or vacation. The state Senate has passed companion legislation that would cut state funds, used to pay for services like police and firefighting, for cities that try to supersede state laws.Arizona Republicans are literally threatening cities across the state with critical budget cuts that fund critical services if they dare lift a finger to help workers. Governor Doug Ducey also supports the legislation so it could very well become law.And if you aren t quite pissed off enough yet, just wait till you read what Arizona GOP Senator Andy Biggs had to say about his party s effort to make workers feel like slaves.According to Biggs, cities  think that they re an independent and sovereign entity from the state, which is not true they re a creature of the state. You can t put a municipality in jail, nor would we. What we re really seeking to do is provide a deterrent effect. Yeah, the kind of deterrent that says Republicans are flaming hypocrites when it comes to saying they support small government. Instead of cheering on local governments for making decisions themselves, Arizona Republicans have declared that the state is a mini-tyranny where only the state gets to make the rules and good luck getting any money for your city or town to protect yourself against bands of thieves, killers, and fires if you rebel against King John in an effort to help the working poor.Seriously, where s Robin Hood when you need him?Featured image via Wikimedia",0

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote next week on new sanctions on Iran s ballistic missile program and on Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia, senior House Republicans said on Friday, seeking to take a tough line against Iran without immediately moving to undermine the international nuclear deal.  It is Congress  responsibility to work with the executive branch on a clear-eyed strategy to stop Iran s reckless behavior,  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the number two House Republican, and Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement emailed to Reuters.  Immediate action towards this goal will come from the House next week as we vote on legislation that furthers sanctions on Hezbollah and Iran s missile proliferation,  they said. President Donald Trump defied both allies and adversaries on Oct. 13 by refusing to certify that Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. That threw the fate of the agreement between Iran, the United States and other world powers into the hands of Congress, by opening a 60-day window in which Congress could reimpose, or   snap back,  sanctions on Iran s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement. However, many of Trump s fellow Republicans - who all opposed the deal reached under former Democratic President Barack Obama - have said they see no immediate need to do so. Congressional aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the missile and Hezbollah sanctions. In the Senate, a separate effort is under way to amend existing U.S. law to set new conditions for the U.S. role in the pact, although critics said such a plan could violate terms of the deal, formally known as the JCPOA. Britain, France and Germany, European U.S. allies who signed the agreement, are particularly concerned about Trump s action and have lobbied Congress to preserve the nuclear pact. Among other things, the ballistic missiles bill would toughen existing sanctions by going after entities with assets outside the United States if they were found to support Iran s ballistic missile program. It has broad bipartisan support in the House, and also is expected to pass the Senate. The Hezbollah bill is directed at the Shi ite militia s allies in Lebanon s government and asks the Trump administration to estimate and distribute assessments of the net worth of Lebanese politicians. The Senate has already unanimously passed a different version of the Hezbollah sanctions bill. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders announced on Friday he had accepted an invitation to the Vatican, saying his views on fighting income equality were similar to those of Pope Francis. “I am a big, big fan of the pope,” Sanders said in an interview on MSNBC. “He’s trying to inject this sense of morality into how we do economics ... and we need that absolutely desperately.” The Sanders campaign said in a statement that he would attend a conference on social, economic and environmental issues during the April 15 visit. Sanders, who has made fighting poverty a central issue of his campaign, said he would talk about how to create a moral economy during his visit. The visit will come four days before the primary election in delegate-rich New York, a state that both Sanders and his rival Democrat Hillary Clinton are viewing as home turf and hoping to win. The announcement of Sanders’ trip came as the pope called for a church that was less strict and more compassionate toward “imperfect” Catholics. Sanders said he admires the pope for talking about the “worship of money, the greed that’s out there.” “There are people who think that Bernie Sanders is radical,” Sanders said on MSNBC. “Read what the pope is writing.” ",1

"Former Senator Jim DeMint speaks up in the WSJ about the obscene salaries the higher ups at PBS and NPR are getting:When presidents of government-funded broadcasting are making more than the president of the United States, it s time to get the government out of public broadcasting.While executives at the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) are raking in massive salaries, the organizations are participating in an aggressive lobbying effort to prevent Congress from saving hundreds of millions of dollars each year by cutting their subsidies.The so-called commercial free public airwaves have been filled with pleas for taxpayer cash. The Association of Public Television Stations has hired lobbyists to fight the cuts. Hundreds of taxpayer-supported TV, radio and Web outlets have partnered with an advocacy campaign to facilitate emails and phone calls to Capitol Hill for the purpose of telling members of Congress,  Public broadcasting funding is too important to eliminate! PBS President Paula Kerger even recorded a personal television appeal that told viewers exactly how to contact members of Congress in order to  let your representative know how you feel about the elimination of funding for public broadcasting.  But if PBS can pay Ms. Kerger $632,233 in annual compensation as reported on the 990 tax forms all nonprofits are required to file surely it can operate without tax dollars Meanwhile, highly successful, brand-name public programs like Sesame Street make millions on their own.  Sesame Street,  for example, made more than $211 million from toy and consumer product sales from 2003-2006. Sesame Workshop President and CEO Gary Knell received $956,513 in compensation in 2008. With earnings like that, Big Bird doesn t need the taxpayers to help him compete against the Nickleodeon cable channel s Dora the Explorer.Read more: WSJ",0
"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!The United States  sent Iran $400 million in debt plus $1.3 billion in interest, and the money was disbursed as a ransom payment for four American hostages of the Islamic regime, a top Iranian commander said Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, the U.S. paid the Iranian regime $425 million dollars per American hostage, according to the commander. The annulment of sanctions against Iran s Bank Sepah and reclaiming of $1.7mln of Iran s frozen assets after 36 years showed that the US doesn t understand anything but the language of force,  said Iranian Basij Commander Brig Gen Mohammed Reza Naqdi, addressing his forces in Tehran. This money was returned for the freedom of the US spy and it was not related to the (nuclear) negotiations,  he claimed, according to state-controlled Fars News Agency.Four Americans who were held hostage by the Islamic Republic   Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, Pastor Saeed Abedini, and Nosratollah Khosrawi Roudsari (who decided to stay in Iran)   were part of the deal that included the ransom payment, along with the release of seven Iranians who were sitting in American jails on charges of thwarting international sanctions, and the delisting of 14 Iranian nationals from Interpol s Red List, which seeks international criminals for extradition.A fifth American, Matthew Trevithick, who was imprisoned by Tehran, was also released, but under the terms of a separate deal, according to reports.The U.S. State Department tells Breitbart News that the payment to Iran was  separate but simultaneous,  and not a ransom. We did not pay ransom to secure the return of these Americans. The funds that were transferred to Iran were part of a separate but simultaneous arrangement we agreed to with Iran related to the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal at the Hague,  a State Department spokesperson told Breitbart News late Wednesday.State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters earlier on Wednesday in Washington that no ransom was paid, rejecting the remarks of the Iranian commander. There was no bribe, there was no ransom, there was nothing paid to secure the return of these Americans who were, by the way, not spies. We ve spoken to this in the days after their release on Sunday morning in great detail about how this process worked. There was this consular channel that was opened up to secure their release,  Toner said. Via: Breitbart NewsHere is the question we posed after discovering the interesting timing of this $1.7 BILLION payment to Iran while 4 American prisoners were being simultaneously released:Was this transfer of funds to a terrorist state (via the American taxpayer), the REAL reason the prisoners  (hostages) Iran was holding were suddenly released? Did the incompetent Obama-Kerry duo use this  settlement  as a bargaining chip to make it appear as though freeing these hostages was part of the Iran nuclear deal all along? This is absolutely sickening The United States and Iran on Sunday settled a longstanding claim at the Hague, releasing to Tehran $400 million in funds frozen since 1981 plus $1.3 billion in interest, the State Department said.The funds were part of a trust fund once used by Iran to purchase military equipment from the United States but which was tied up for decades in litigation at the Iran-US Claims Tribunal.The settlement announcement was made after Tehran released five American detainees in a prisoner swap as a nuclear deal was implemented.

Under no circumstance will Mexico pay for the wall that Mr. Trump is proposing,  he said.  Building a wall between Mexico and the United States is a terrible idea. It is an idea based on ignorance and has no foundation in the reality of North American integration. Trump has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the U.S. border and has vowed to increase fees on some Mexican visas and all border crossing cards as part of a broader plan to force Mexico to pay for the wall.

"PAGO PAGO, American Samoa (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has cut short the final leg of his Asia trip to race back to Washington, where the Trump administration faces a critical week on tax reform and a funding plan to keep the government running, an aide said on Sunday.     Pence, who has been traveling in Asia to reassure allies and partners about President Donald Trump’s commitment to the region, had originally planned to spend two nights in Honoluluat the end of a trip that took him to South Korea, Japan, Indonesia and Australia. While he spoke with business leaders in each country, Pence’s trip was overshadowed by rising tensions in North Korea, where it is feared another nuclear test could be conducted soon in defiance of United Nations sanctions. Pence will now spend one night in Hawaii and is slated to be back in Washington on Tuesday morning, his aide told reporters before Air Force Two landed at Pago Pago in American Samoa for refueling.     Trump has a busy week ahead. Funding appropriated by Congress to run the government runs out on Friday, so he and lawmakers must agree on new legislation or the government will shut down on Saturday.     Saturday is also Trump’s 100th day in office, a benchmark used by pundits to assess the initial accomplishments and shortfalls of his young presidency.     Trump plans to outline principles for tax reform onWednesday, a top brief for Pence.     While in Honolulu, Pence will meet leaders of the U.S.Pacific Command and is also slated to speak to U.S. troops and their families, the aide said.     Pence had planned to tour the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor but will no longer do that, the aide said. ",1
"President Trump keeps another promise. The winning streak for Americans continues The Department of Homeland Security will stop processing any new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday at a Justice Department news conference.Sessions was critical of the Obama program implemented through executive order in 2012 to give work authorization and government benefits, like Social Security to nearly a million illegal aliens.  MRCTV Watch: The brilliant Jessica Vaughan, from the Center for Immigration Studies, shared these important facts about DACA recipients in America, compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales, called the National UnDACAmented Research Project. There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives. ",0
"Has anyone else noticed that the government sometimes seems to like awarding contracts to companies that have proven they re incapable of doing what they re supposed to be doing? Equifax s massive data breach affected most Americans with any kind of credit at all, and here comes the IRS to give Equifax a contract in the name of  fraud prevention, because Equifax has proven that they re awesome at protecting our data. Oh! And then they proved that they were totally and completely transparent and on their consumers  sides when they tried to yank away our right to sue by encouraging all of us to enroll in their own fraud protection program with very fine print binding us to arbitration.The contract, which is a $7.25 million contract to verify our identities and prevent fraud, is a  sole source order,  which means the IRS decided Equifax was the only company capable of doing this for them. Supposedly this is to help prevent an interruption in ID verification while officials try and resolve something else.Equifax s security breach involved sensitive information for over 145 million Americans, including our Social Security numbers. Congressman Greg Walden of Oregon likened the breach to the guards at Fort Knox forgetting to lock the doors. That s how bad this hack was.The IRS itself isn t exactly free of security issues, either. They ve had severe problems with tax-ID fraud and other data hacks. Senator Orrin Hatch, of the Senate Finance Committee, has said he s worried the IRS doesn t have the technology necessary  to safeguard the integrity of our tax administration system. Well, it seems Equifax doesn t either, and yet the IRS is giving up our information to them for  fraud prevention. The House Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection subcommittee called Equifax  stupid,  and said they  deserve to be shamed,  and called the breach  shocking  and  unprecedented.  Walden also said: How does this happen when so much is at stake? I don t think we can pass a law that can fix stupid. Apparently they can t regulate the stupid of the IRS, either. We should all cross our fingers and pray nothing else happens to our data now. That s literally about all we can do.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",0

"PARIS (Reuters) - French counter-terrorism investigators questioned five people on Tuesday after police over the weekend found what appeared to be a ready-to-detonate bomb at an apartment building in one of Paris s poshest neighborhoods. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said one of those arrested was on an intelligence services list of  radicalized  persons - a list that includes the names of potential Islamist militants.  We are still in a state of war,  Collomb, speaking after a Sunday attack in which a man stabbed and killed two women outside the train station in Marseille, told France Inter radio. Judicial sources said the explosive device included two gas canisters inside the building in the affluent 16th district of western Paris and two outside, some of them doused with petrol and wired to connect to a mobile phone. More than 230 people have been killed in attacks by Islamist militants in France over the past three years. The Islamic State militant group, whose bases in Syria and Iraq are being bombed by French war planes, has urged followers to attack France. Most of those killed died when Islamist gunmen and suicide bombers targeted Paris in 2015, and when a man drove a large truck into crowds in the Riviera resort of Nice in 2016. Since then, there has been a string of attacks perpetrated by lone assailants, often targeting police or soldiers.  The threat is changing form,  said Collomb. A counter-terrorism investigation is also under way after the attack on Sunday, when a man slit the throat of one of his victims and killed her cousin before being shot dead by soldiers in the southern port city. Tunisian authorities have identified the attacker as Ahmed Hanachi, Collomb told parliament. He lived in France from 2005 to 2006 and was known to police under several alias  for petty crimes, but had not previously caught the attention of French intelligence agencies. Hanachi was arrested in the city of Lyon on Friday on suspicion of theft. He was carrying a Tunisian passport and released 24 hours later, a day before committing the attack.  All these years, he used multiple identities in France as well as in Italy, declaring himself to be Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian,  Collomb said.  France declared a state of emergency in late 2015 after the Paris attack, giving police special search and arrest powers to combat would-be terrorists. Lawmakers will vote later on Tuesday on a bill to convert many of those emergency measures into common law.  ",1
"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Irrespective of whether Mexico’s decision to extradite drug kingpin Joaquin “Chapo” Guzman aimed to honor outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama or appease his successor, Donald Trump, law enforcement from both countries say it bodes well for security cooperation. Guzman, the feared boss of the Sinaloa cartel who shot to international stardom after two jailbreaks, was extradited from a prison in northern Mexico to New York on Thursday, the eve of Trump’s inauguration. While some Mexican government officials believed Guzman’s removal served as a valediction for Obama’s presidency, others saw it as an opening gambit in what are likely to be fraught trade negotiations with a seemingly unfriendly Trump administration. But current and former law enforcement officials on both sides of the border said the move would boost security cooperation and could even upgrade relations. “What happened today is something that’s a victory for both Mexico and the United States,” said Leo Silva, who worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey until 2015. “This will obviously improve things.” According to a senior U.S. law enforcement official based in Mexico, both U.S. and Mexican security forces were already “three steps ahead” in identifying the next Chapo. “From the Mexico side, they work with us a lot, a lot more than people think,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak with press. “They think they’re going to get more support from us, they’re on line and I really don’t see a huge change. If anything, an improvement.” Security cooperation has not always run smoothly, and Mexico, with its proud, nationalist leanings, has often chafed at what it views as U.S. intrusion in its affairs. Silva said after Vicente Fox became president in 2000, Mexico gave less access to U.S. law enforcement. However, Fox’s successor, Felipe Calderon, was more willing to accept U.S. help, and Silva said he could even pick up the phone and call then-Attorney General Marisela Morales. The election of the Institutional Revolutionary Party’s Enrique Pena Nieto in 2012 represented a fresh set-back, with U.S. officials initially kept at arm’s length and a new attorney general appointed, Jesus Murillo Karam, who Silva called “standoffish.” Nonetheless, after a rocky start, relations soon warmed and U.S. intelligence, particularly the U.S. Marshals who track fugitives, became a key component in many of the high-profile busts that have taken place under Pena Nieto. “It’s similar to what we were doing and receiving under Calderon, except that this current administration doesn’t talk about it or publicize that they’re working together,” said one former DEA agent who worked on Mexican cases. After the victory of Trump, who has threatened to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, slap tariffs on U.S. firms  manufacturing in Mexico and deport millions of illegal immigrants, some speculated years of hard-won security cooperation would fray as Mexico sought to show it wouldn’t be pushed around by the brash New Yorker. But behind the bluster, law enforcement officials from both countries said that was unlikely to happen, and that the situation could even improve if Trump, a law-and-order Republican who has repeatedly voiced his support for police and soldiers, focused more on combating Mexican cartels. “The crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential,” Trump said during his inauguration speech on Friday. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.” A Mexican anti-corruption official swatted away the notion that Mexico could shut out the United States on security issues.  “The government is going to continue the policy that it has always had of combating organized crime,” he said. Vito Guardino, who worked for the DEA for 30 years, said the U.S. government used extradition as a yardstick to measure other countries’ willingness to cooperate. But if the United States didn’t get what it wanted, he said, it found ways of forcing other nations to play ball, a reality unlikely to be lost on Mexico, which is heavily reliant on U.S. trade. For example, Guardino said that when Colombia stopped extraditing drug traffickers to the United States in the late 1980s, the U.S. government used a carrot-and-stick approach, threatening sanctions while drawing up the multibillion-dollar Plan Colombia. By that metric, Chapo’s removal represents a calculated show of faith on the part of Mexico, which has also signaled to Trump’s team it is open to reinforcing the northern border to curb drug smuggling and illegal migration. The high-stakes political tensions were, however, only one way of looking at things, Guardino and many others said. Relationships with foreign law enforcement officials often take years to build and rely on trust in dangerous circumstances. ",1
"(Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Wednesday he expected the federal government to waive the Jones Act, which would lift restrictions on ships that can provide aid to the island devastated by Hurricane Maria. He said he has been speaking with members of Congress from both parties who have supported an emergency waiver.      “We expect them to waive it,” Rossello said in an interview with CNN. He noted there was a seven-day waiver after Hurricane Irma, which was much less devastating to the island.     On Tuesday, the Trump administration said there was no need to waive shipping restrictions to help get fuel and supplies to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, saying it would do nothing to address the island’s damaged ports, the main impediment to shipping. A waiver would allow Puerto Rico to get help not only from U.S. ships but from any ships that can bring aid.     “That is critical, particularly for fuel,” he said. “One of the considerations right now is the priority of getting fuel, diesel, gasoline, all across the island. Right now we have enough fuel. We’re limited by the transportation logistics, but at some point of course, getting fuel into the island is going to be critical so that we can have the major functions of telecoms, hospitals, water, to be running appropriately.”     The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by American owned-and-operated ships. U.S. Senator John McCain asked acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke on Tuesday to grant an emergency waiver of the law. He said that Puerto Rican residents would have to pay at least twice as much for food, drinking water and other supplies without the waiver. (This corrected version of the story fixes paragraph four to show the administration has not formally denied a waiver request). ",1
"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Police fired tear gas to disperse supporters of Democratic Republic of Congo s opposition chief on Sunday as they gathered in the capital amid high tensions over election delays keeping President Joseph Kabila in power, a Reuters witness said. Felix Tshisekedi, head of an opposition coalition, is due to fly back to the capital Kinshasa on Sunday after a prolonged absence abroad.

"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong s highest court granted bail to two prominent young pro-democracy activists, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, on Tuesday pending an appeal over their jail terms for unlawful assembly linked to the city s mass pro-democracy protests in 2014. Hong Kong s appeals court jailed Wong, 21, Law, 24 and Alex Chow, 27, leaders of the Chinese-ruled city s democracy movement, in August. Their sentencing came as a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompted accusations of political interference. The trio helped lead the largely peaceful  Umbrella Movement  that blocked major roads for 79 days in 2014, demanding Beijing grant Hong Kong full democracy. Hong Kong has been governed under a  one country, two systems  formula since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997, allowing freedoms not enjoyed on mainland China that include an independent judiciary. Hong Kong Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, who heads the Court of Final Appeal, granted Wong and Law bail of HK$50,000 ($6,408) each while they appeal against their respective six-month and eight-month jail terms.  There s no flight risk,  Ma told the court. Chow did not apply for bail.  Ma said a Court of Final Appeal hearing would be held on Nov. 7 to consider the trio s applications for appeal. The next legal steps will likely be scrutinised closely, with the jailings having shaken confidence in Hong Kong s vaunted rule of law. Wong, Chow and Law were sentenced last year to community service for unlawful assembly. However, Reuters reported that Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen had overruled other senior colleagues to re-open the case and push for a harsher sentence that eventually led to their imprisonment. A group of senior international lawyers recently issued a joint letter saying the jailings posed a serious threat to the city s rule of law.  ($1 = 7.8030 Hong Kong dollars) ",1

"And the AFL-CIO is crying in their money pit wouldn t it be a great get to have college football players unionized? The players are students and not employees unless you want to bust this whole thing wide open and tell the truth about how players might be compensated. It s really pretty shocking that the NLRB decided to shoot this down since they re 3-2 Dem. The National Labor Relations Board rejected a bid by football players at Northwestern University to form a union. In an unanimous decision released Monday, the board said it lacked jurisdiction in the matter. By statute the board does not have jurisdiction over state-run colleges and universities,  it said. The board is the main federal labor law enforcement agency. Its members are nominated by the president and it currently has a 3-2 Democratic majority.The announcement reverses a March 2014 decision by a board regional director, who ruled that the players were employees of the university, not students. Therefore, they had the right to form a union.While that ruling applied only to Northwestern athletes, it had major implications for college athletics generally, being the first time a student-athlete group has been granted collective bargaining rights. Other groups could have cited it as a precedent if they tried to unionize.Via: Washington Examiner",0
"21st Century Wire says Incredibly, on the same day that US  intelligence  officials were due to meet President-Elect Donald Trump about the alleged Russian Hack  report   like clockwork, another  Active Shooter  event springs-up, this time at Fort Lauderdale International Airport in Florida. Very dramatic, great television drama on CNN and elsewhere. As a result, no US news channel covered the epic flop of the CIA s report debacle and Trump s reaction to it until the evening news cycle.Stay tuned to 21WIRE later on, for a full Daily Shooter report on today s Fort Lauderdale Airport attack.Thus far, we re told that the suspect got off a Delta Flight from Anchorage, Alaska, calmly collected his bags, went into a bathroom, loaded his gun (which we re told was stored legally in his check-on luggage) and stepped into the baggage claim area and began shooting and killing people.And just when you thought this story couldn t get any more ridiculous, we re meant to swallow this Just now, CNN reported that suspect Esteban Santiago was a member of the National Guard, served in Iraq, and was hearing  ISIS voices  in his head. Anchor Erin Burnett stated on air: The shooter went into FBI office in Anchorage (Alaska) and told officials he was hearing voices in his head telling him to join ISIS! Indeed, exactly as 21WIRE predicted yesterday:CIA #russianhacking report out Monday. Our guess: there's nothing in it. What will Obama do as distraction? New hack? #ISIS attack?  21st Century Wire (@21WIRE) January 6, 2017As expected, CNN is pushing the  mental health  angle, with panel experts talking-up the need for more gun control and  mental health checks. Here s the official mainstream narrative  (CNN) Five people were shot dead and eight wounded in a baggage claim area at Fort Lauderdale s airport, and law enforcement sources tell CNN the suspect, identified as Esteban Santiago, had brought the firearm in his checked luggage.Authorities said it was too early to understand why the suspect, who was taken into custody without incident, opened fire at the Florida airport.Florida Sen. Bill Nelson told CNN that Santiago had a military identification card, but he did not know whether it was current.Here s the latest on what we know:  Thirteen people were shot and eight were taken to hospitals, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. Five others died from their wounds.  The suspect joined the National Guard in Puerto Rico in 2007. In April 2010, he went to Iraq for 10 months. A spokeswoman for the Alaska Army National Guard said Santiago was in the Army Reserves before he joined the guard there in November 2014. Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead said Santiago was discharged in August for unsatisfactory performance.  The suspect showed up several months ago at the FBI office in Anchorage, law enforcement officials told CNN. He was interviewed and said he was hearing voices in his head, including some telling him to join ISIS. He was taken to a hospital for a mental health evaluation, voluntarily checked himself in, the officials explained.  Law enforcement sources told CNN that the suspect flew to Florida on Friday from Alaska and had declared the firearm. When he arrived at the airport, the suspect retrieved a bag at baggage claim, took out the gun and started firing, the sources said. One source said he went to the bathroom to get the gun out of his luggage and emerged firing.  Sheriff Israel said the gunman likely acted alone. The sheriff said it was too early to say whether terrorism was the motive.  Gov. Rick Scott told reporters at the airport:  The citizens of Florida will not tolerate senseless acts of evil. Whoever is responsible will held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.  The governor said that now was time to mourn the dead and pray for hospitalized victims, not talk about gun laws.  Multiple reports on social media   including tweets from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer   described the shooting.Continue the mainstream story at CNNREAD MORE DAILY SHOOTER NEWS AT: 21WIRE Daily Shooter FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",0
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China called on Monday for all countries to make constructive efforts to ease tension after North Korea said the latest U.N. sanctions against it are an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade. The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad. The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea on Sunday rejected the resolution, calling it an act of war. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the resolution appropriately strengthened the sanctions but was not designed to affect ordinary people, normal economic exchanges and cooperation, or humanitarian aid.  Hua noted it also called for the use of peaceful means to resolve the issue and that all sides should take steps to reduce tension.  In the present situation, we call on all countries to exercise restraint and make proactive and constructive efforts to ease the tensions on the peninsula and appropriately resolve the issue,  she told a daily news briefing. The North s old allies China and Russia both supported the latest U.N. sanctions. Tension has been rising over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called  brutal sanctions , saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide. North Korea on Nov. 29 said it successfully tested a new ICBM that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korea s leader. China, with which North Korea does some 90 percent of its trade, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint from all sides and for a return to talks. ",1
"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish national police began to seize ballot boxes and voting papers from Catalan polling stations, the Interior Ministry said, as some voters began casting ballots in Catalonia s disputed independence referendum on Sunday. Riot police clashed with voters outside a Barcelona voting station, where dozens of police used riot shields to push people back, a Reuters witness said. Would-be voters chanted  we are people of peace  and  we are not afraid . Half a dozen armored police vans and an ambulance stood ready nearby, the witness said.  Elsewhere in the northeastern region, some voting stations opened at 9 AM (0700 GMT) and people began to cast ballots. ",1

"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appeared before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, amid new questions about Anti-Trump text messages sent by FBI employees assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation. Rosenstein testified that Mueller is running his office  appropriately  and without bias.In a colorful exchange between Congressman Steve Chabot (R-OH) and Rosenstein, Chabot asked the Deputy AG: How with a straight face, can you say that this group of Democrat partisans are unbiased, and will give President Trump a fair shake? After a brief stammer, Rosenstein replied that political affiliation and the issue of bias are different things, and that we should trust the experience Mueller and the Justice Department have in managing investigation teams, adding: We recognize that we have employees with political opinions, and it s our responsibility to make sure those opinions do not influence their actions. To which Chabot argued how can anyone possibly reach that conclusion: I was at first encouraged. It seemed like a serious matter and deserved a serious investigation. And I assumed, as many of us did, that Mr. Mueller would pull together an unbiased team. But, rather than wearing stripes as umpires and referees might wear, I would submit that the Mueller team overwhelmingly, uh, oughta be attired with Democratic donkeys on their jerseys or  I m with Hillary  t-shirts, certainly not with  Let s Make America Great Again and I think that s a shame. Because I think the American people deserve a lot better than the very biased team they re getting under Robert Mueller. And I think it s really sad.

"Obama has a knack for going overseas and disparaging the citizens of the United States. The hate America mantra. It s what he knows. It s how he s wired. But this time, a real American who genuinely loves his country is fighting back and you re gonna love how he responds to our petulant anti-American President MANILA, Philippines   President Barack Obama lashed out Wednesday at Republicans who insist on barring Syrian refugees from entering the US, deeming their words offensive and insisting  it needs to stop. Apparently they re scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America,  Obama said.Mocking GOP leaders for thinking they re tough, Obama said overblown rhetoric from Republicans could be a potent recruitment tool for the Islamic State group.He insisted that the US process for screening refugees for possible entry into the US was rigorous and said the US didn t make good decisions  based on hysteria  or exaggerated risk. We are not well served when in response to a terrorist attack we descend into fear and panic,  the president said.Obama s comments during a meeting with Filipino President Benigno Aquino marked his harshest condemnation yet of Republicans  response to the Paris attacks blamed on ISIS that killed 129 people last week.Republicans in Congress and on the 2016 presidential trail have urged an immediate closing of America s borders to Syrian refugees, but the Obama administration has shown no sign of backing off its plans to bring an additional 10,000 Syrians fleeing civil war into the US.Sen. Ted Cruz had sharp words for President Barack Obama over his comments regarding Republican rhetoric on Syrian refugees, saying his statement  is utterly unbefitting of a president. If you want to insult me, you can do it overseas, you can do it in Turkey, you can do it in foreign countries, but I would encourage you, mister president, come back and insult me to my face,  the Texas senator and Republican presidential candidate said this on Capitol Hill Wednesday. It is utterly unbefitting of the president to be engaging in those kind of personal insults and attacks,  Cruz said in Washington, D.C., in video captured by NBC News.  He talked about how he was belittling the Republican field as scared. Well let me suggest something: Mr. President, if you want to insult me, you can do it overseas, you can do it in Turkey, you can do it in foreign countries. But I would encourage you Mr. President, come back and insult me to my face,  Cruz said. President Obama had harsh words for Republicans calling for a stop of Syrian refugees to the United States, saying such calls are just  political posturing. When individuals say that we should have a religious test and that only Christians   proven Christians   should be admitted   that s offensive and contrary to American values,  President Obama said in Manila yesterday.  I cannot think of a more potent recruitment tool for ISIL than some of the rhetoric that s been coming out of here during the course of this debate. Another Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee, also had tough words for Obama, calling him  delusional. If the President honestly believes that ISIS is concerned about what we think about them and that they are driven by that than the president is more delusional than I ever imagined when it comes to dealing with this crisis,  Huckabee said on MSNBC Wednesday.  It s just astonishing the president would make this all about himself not about the safety and security of the American people. Via: NBC News",0
"Donald Trump has so many feuds going on at the moment it can be hard to keep track of them all. One of the most potentially damaging feuds, though, is with the United Kingdom s Prime Minister David Cameron. Now, that feud continues with Trump s latest comments directed towards Cameron.Cameron has made his opinion of the guaranteed Republican presidential nomination very clear. Back in December, Cameron publicly stated that he thinks Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States is  stupid, divisive and wrong.  Cameron s statement couldn t be more accurate, as Trump s proposal goes against the very basic principles of the United States and would be logistically impossible to enforce.During an interview with Piers Morgan, Trump spoke out against Cameron s comments, offering a sad attempt at an olive branch towards Cameron, where he insisted that he is not stupid and is a unifier. It looks like we re not going to have a very good relationship. Who knows! I hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like he s not willing to address the problem either,  Trump said in the interview, according to the Jerusalem Post.  Well, number one I m not stupid, Okay. I can tell you that, right now   just the opposite. Number two, in terms of divisive: I don t think I m a divisive person. I m a unifier, unlike our president now, I m a unifier,  he Trump concluded.As bizarre as it is to hear a grown man insist to another that he is in fact not stupid, Cameron never actually called Trump himself stupid. He called his policy stupid because it is. It s also nothing more than an incredibly xenophobic, racist, and ridiculous bit of fear mongering. It s one of the first policy proposals that Trump introduced. It sounded the alarm bells that Trump is more than just a buffoon looking for attention, it showed the world that he could actually be a very dangerous threat to the United States and the world if given the opportunity to seize actual political power.Featured image from (Photo by Isaac Brekken/Getty Images)",0

"Generally, it s considered rather unprofessional to comment on someone s looks rather than their actions or words, but it s hard not to notice one very strange and unusual occurrence. Throughout the decades, Donald Trump skin pallor has turned from the normal white guy shade of beige to a color which is best represented by a pumpkin.Now, the rings around his eyes pretty much prove that Trump either spends time in tanning beds or he is a fan of fake spray tans, either of which would involve tiny goggles. Well, according to a Mother Jones expose, it could be either, but that s not the news. The news is why Trump seems to be such a fan of fake tans and it gives you a glimpse into the type of cronyism we could expect if Trump were to become president.Trump is good friends with an Indiana businessman named Steve Hilbert. In 2006, Hilbert became the CEO of New Sunshine, a company that makes tanning beds, spray tanning booths, tanning lotions, and bronzers.Trump and Hilbert have a lot in common. They are the same age. They are both rich. They both change wives about as often as Trump supporters change underwear (sorry) and they both have hideous, garish taste in decorating. Hilbert, when he was an insurance CEO, was one of the country s highest paid and he even helicoptered to work   a whole two miles.The businessman reportedly met his sixth and current wife in the early 1990s, when she jumped topless out of a cake at a party for one of his stepsons. The cake story may be apocryphal, but Tomisue Hilbert, who is the same age as Melania, was indeed a 23-year-old topless dancer and a single mother when she married Steve.The Hilberts once lived in a three-story, 23,000 square-foot faux-French mansion dubbed Le Chateau Renaissance, which was located on a 33-acre compound outside Indianapolis that included a 15,000-square-foot  sports barn  with a full-size reproduction of the Indiana University basketball court. The mansion, once valued at $25 million, featured Trumpesque gold-plated bathroom fixtures and French crystal chandeliers. Hand-painted murals adorned a dome above the entryway, including one depicting a toga-clad Steve Hilbert as an ancient deity.The men had been friends for nearly 20 years when they entered into a business deal together. They bought the General Motors Building in Manhattan for $800 million. Hilbert put up far more money than Trump did ($200 million vs. $11 million plus there was a third partner) but somehow, Trump received a 50 percent interest in the building. He also put his name on the building.The two men, along with their wives du jour, also socialize together. They stay in each other s vacation homes. They attend each other s multiple weddings.After a disastrous departure from his company, Conseco, Hilbert started the tanning business. While Mother Jones doesn t know for sure that Trump uses his products, they do say this:This is also around the time that Trump started to turn orange. Did the Hilberts get Trump into tanning? Does he use New Sunshine spray tans or tanning bed bronzers? (Reviewers have suggested that turning orange a  rich shade of burnt orange,  in the words of one can be a distinct side effect of using such products.) The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about whether Trump used New Sunshine tanning products. Questions sent by email and FedEx to Hilbert s Indiana home went unanswered. It s clear, though, that Trump is familiar with New Sunshine s wares. He promoted the company s tanning products on The Celebrity Apprentice in two episodes.There s more to the story, which includes some pretty shady business deals, but at least we might now know why Trump is that awful shade of orange.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",0
"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand acting Prime Minister Bill English said on Monday it could take until the end of the week to confirm the country s next government following an inconclusive election last month. The country has been in political limbo since Sept. 23 when neither the National Party, which has led the government since 2008, or the Labour Party, won enough seats to form a government. That left the nationalist New Zealand First Party in a position to determine the next government and leader Winston Peters spent five days last week holding negotiations with both major parties. English, who heads the National Party told Radio New Zealand there were a number of issues still to be worked out, including ministerial appointments. He said his staff were going back and forth with NZ First on policy issues over the weekend.  While New Zealand First are having a discussion today they won t be dealing with completed agreements because there s still outstanding issues,  English said. When asked whether he anticipated a confirmed government by the end of the week, English replied:  I would expect so, yes . Peters was meeting with his party s board on Monday. He has said the board must meet before a final decision can be made. Peters also told local radio there would be an agreement by the end of the week, but did not want to  put a time on it . A spokeswoman for NZ First later told Reuters there would be no announcement on Monday and that the meeting would continue into the night and then again on Tuesday morning. Peters had originally expected to reach a decision by Oct. 12.  The political uncertainty has knocked 2.2 percent off the New Zealand dollar since the vote last month and recent surveys have shown it is weighing on business sentiment and economic activity. Growth in New Zealand s services sector slipped in September as the inconclusive election hit sales activity, a survey showed on Monday. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern on Saturday released a video on YouTube in which she defended the process dragging on.  If you re going to form a government, of course you need to understand one another s policy positions, where you have consensus and the kind of government you want to form ... It s only natural that that would take a little bit of time,  she said. NZ First s policies are more aligned with those of Labour - both favor curbing immigration and foreign ownership, renegotiating certain trade deals and changes to the central bank s approach to monetary policy. But observers have said that a two-way coalition is much simpler to put together than one involving three parties. The Greens and Labour would have to get together for the left-wing parties to form a government. ",1
"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico s will receive a pay out of $150 million from a catastrophe bond after a Sept. 7 quake met parameters for magnitude, location and depth, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.

Mexico was hit by two devastating quakes last month, the Sept. 19 tremor that hit Mexico City hard and an even more powerful earthquake that struck the country s south on Sept. 7.  ",1
"BERLIN (Reuters) - If the United States terminates the Iran nuclear deal or reimposes sanctions on Tehran it could result in Iran developing nuclear weapons and raise the danger of war close to Europe, Germany s foreign minister said on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump refused on Friday to formally certify that Tehran was complying with the 2015 accord even though international inspectors say it is. He warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Deutschlandfunk radio that Trump had sent a  difficult and dangerous signal  when the U.S. administration was also dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis.  My big concern is that what is happening in Iran or with Iran from the U.S. perspective will not remain an Iranian issue but many others in the world will consider whether they themselves should acquire nuclear weapons too given that such agreements are being destroyed,  Gabriel said.  And then our children and grandchildren will grow up in a very dangerous world,  he said. He said if the United States terminated the deal or if sanctions were reimposed on Tehran, it would give Iranian hardliners, who are against negotiations with the West, the upper hand.  Then they might revert to developing nuclear weapons,  Gabriel said, adding Israel would not tolerate that and  then we will be back where we were 10, 12 years ago with the danger of war relatively close to Europe . He urged the United States not to endanger the security of its allies and its own people for domestic policy reasons. Hailed by Trump s predecessor Barack Obama as key to stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb, the deal was also signed by China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union. European allies have warned of a split with Washington over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo undermines U.S. credibility abroad. Trump has given the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reinstate economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2016. ",1

"KIEV (Reuters) - U.S Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said on Wednesday she was encouraged by signs of commitment to reform from Ukraine’s new government and urged Kiev to start jailing corrupt officials. Months of political turmoil in the run-up to the cabinet reshuffle - the biggest since an uprising in 2014 brought in a pro-Western leadership - have derailed efforts to root out corruption, delaying billions of dollars in foreign loans. “Overall, I go home encouraged by the commitment of all the political forces ‎to continuing and accelerating reform, economic reform, anti-corruption reform, in particular judicial reform,” she said at the end of her first official visit to Kiev since the political shakeup earlier in April. Former prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk resigned two weeks ago and was replaced by Volodymyr Groysman, a close ally of President Petro Poroshenko.    “Obviously corruption is still a very deep problem. It’s time to start locking up people who have ripped off the Ukrainian population for too long,” she said.  Nuland called for greater political unity, insisting Ukraine must “stay the course” with a $17.5 billion bailout program from the International Monetary Fund, whose third tranche of $1.7 billion has been delayed since last October. Pro-European reformists in Ukraine have previously expressed concern that the latest political reboot will not eliminate the influence of powerful business interests on policymaking. Nuland said further U.S. financial assistance to Ukraine - a third $1-billion loan guarantee is in the offing -  would depend on the government sticking to the IMF program.  ",1

"MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spain moved closer on Monday to imposing central rule over Catalonia to thwart its independence push as Madrid s High Court signaled a hardening line by jailing the leaders of two of the largest separatist organizations. In the first imprisonment of senior secessionist figures since Catalonia s Oct. 1 independence referendum, the court ordered the heads of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Omnium held without bail pending an investigation for alleged sedition. Prosecutors say that the ANC s Jordi Sanchez and Omnium s Jordi Cuixart played central roles in orchestrating pro-independence protests that last month trapped national police inside a Barcelona building and destroyed their vehicles. Around 200 people flocked to the Catalan government s headquarters in Barcelona in a peaceful show of support for both men, with some chanting  Freedom  and waving  Democracy  banners.  The ANC, which has organized protests of hundreds of thousands of secessionists in the past, called for further peaceful demonstrations around Catalonia on Tuesday.  Catalan regional President Carles Puigdemont commented on Twitter:  Spain jails Catalonia s civil society leaders for organizing peaceful demonstrations. Sadly, we have political prisoners again    an allusion to Spain s military dictatorship under Francisco Franco. The High Court also banned the Catalan police chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, from leaving Spain and seized his passport while he is being investigated over the same incident, though it did not order his arrest. Last Tuesday, Puigdemont stepped back from asking the Catalan parliament to vote on independence, instead making a symbolic declaration and calling for negotiations on the region s future. In a confrontation viewed with mounting alarm in European capitals and financial markets, Puigdemont failed on Monday to respond to Madrid s ultimatum to clarify whether he had declared unilateral independence in a speech last week. He now has until Thursday to back down.  In a letter to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy,  Puigdemont gave no direct answer on the independence issue, instead making a  sincere and honest  offer for dialogue over the next two months. In reply, Rajoy said Puigdemont s stance had brought Madrid closer to triggering Article 155 of the constitution, under which it can impose direct rule on any of the country s 17 autonomous communities if they break the law. The Catalan government s campaign to break away from Spain has pitched the country into its worst political crisis since an abortive coup attempt in 1981. On Monday the economy ministry told the EU that it had slashed its economic growth forecasts for next year partly due to the situation. The Catalan government says 90 percent of voters in the referendum backed a breakaway, but turnout was only 43 percent as most opponents of independence in the region boycotted the vote, already declared illegal by Spain s Constitutional Court.  Thousands have demonstrated in Barcelona and other Spanish cities both for and against independence. So far the crisis has been largely violence-free, except for the day of the referendum when national police assaulted voters with batons and rubber bullets. The High Court ruled that Trapero, the Catalan police chief, would have his passport withdrawn but rejected a request from the state prosecutor for him to be held in custody. Trapero is a hero to the secessionists after his force took a much softer stance than national police in enforcing the ban on the referendum. Prosecutors say he failed to give orders to rescue national police trapped inside the Barcelona building. Puigdemont last Tuesday delayed by several weeks a formal declaration of independence from Spain to allow for talks. Madrid has ruled out talks unless Puigdemont gives up the independence demand. It had given him until 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Monday to clarify his position with a  Yes  or  No , and until Thursday to change his mind if he insisted on a split. Following his failure to do so, a regional broadcaster said he also planned to ignore a final deadline on Thursday. Suggesting that Puigdemont and his team were in no mood to follow Rajoy s game plan, Catalan interior minister Joaquim Forn said Article 155 would not allow Madrid to remove members of the Catalan government. The article s terms on direct rule, which has never been applied, are vague.  It says Madrid can  adopt any measure  to force a region to meet its constitutional obligations, with the approval of Spain s lower house. The wording suggests this could include anything from taking control of regional police and finances to installing a new governing team or calling a snap election. Underlining the deepening crisis, some of the largest companies in prosperous Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of the Spanish economy, have already shifted head offices elsewhere and others are likely to follow if Puigdemont declares outright independence. Investors say a political split could undermine the economic rebound in Spain, the euro zone s fourth-largest economy. ",1
"ALGONAC, Mich. (Reuters) - Back in April, there were already early signs in this quiet Michigan town of the rural American discontent that helped propel Donald Trump to election victory, even if it was underestimated by the Washington establishment, pollsters and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. On a return visit after Tuesday’s election, Reuters found that many of Algonac’s 4,000 residents were jubilant that Trump had captured the White House, although there were also echoes of what some people said seven months ago: that he is an uncertain, high-stakes gamble. But the bare fact of his success drew only shrugs: Who else did city folks really expect would win? Reuters first visited this town on a bend of the St. Clair River in April after results from the Republican and Democratic parties' primary elections suggested it might be a hotbed of the  dissatisfaction with the status quo that would become a dominant force by November. (reut.rs/2fAVJQY) It was a town in a county in a state that all disproportionately turned out in the primaries for the unexpected outsider candidates: the Republican Trump, a rich real-estate developer and television star who had never held political office; and democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, a  U.S. senator from Vermont who had emerged as Clinton’s closest rival for the Democratic Party nomination. Trump went on to win his party’s nomination, while Sanders was beaten by Clinton.  Even though they came at the problem from very different perspectives, both men had fired up a town that was in a sour mood, striking a chord with their talk of a rigged economic system and their loud disgust at the decline of American manufacturing. Algonac leans Republican, and, on both visits, it took no time at all to find Trump fans, and only a little longer to find Sanders fans. But it took days of asking around to find someone with a warm word for Clinton. On Tuesday, the vote in Algonac was 68 percent for Trump, 27 percent for Clinton. Residents of Algonac can easily list the relatives and neighbors who have struggled with the painful decline of manufacturing or who were forced to move after auto factories with well paid union jobs an hour away in the Detroit area shut down or moved abroad. Older residents recall decades back when Algonac was still a proud self-sufficient manufacturing hub, employing scores of locals at the Chris-Craft factory, which turned out photogenic wooden boats that remain prized by wealthy collectors.  Pete Beauregard has turned the factory into a harbor club where the town’s summer visitors stow their boats.  “The rural area is going to want to be heard,” he said, delighting in Trump’s victory. Up the road, Jay DeBoyer was in a dive bar he had worked in as a younger man, drinking an afternoon glass of water and dressed in a suit he had worn to deliver St. Clair County’s final elections results to the courthouse in his role as county clerk. “The center of the country is what put Donald Trump in office,” he said.  “If the economy’s okay, they shut their mouths and go to work,” he said, describing the sort of people who live in places like Algonac, where 97 percent of residents are white.  “But if you start to smack them, when you start telling the guys working in a coal mine in West Virginia, ‘For the good of the country, we’re going to put you out of a job, for the good of cleaner air we’re going to put you out of a job,’ then you start to create a constituency of people that fall into a category of ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend.’” Mentioning Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, tended to draw scorn among Algonac residents in April, even among some Democrats who said they viewed her as untrustworthy. Her election loss and emotional concession speech this week appeared not to soften this, with some expressing their ill-feeling in crude terms. “Trump That Bitch,” reads a tall wooden sign alongside the main road into town, evoking a familiar anti-Clinton slogan among Trump fans. Seeing it being photographed, Paul Paulus, 73, wandered out from the building where he was regreasing old tractors to boast he had built it entirely himself.  Some of his neighbors, particularly women, had told Reuters on both visits that, even if they disliked Clinton, they despaired at the insults and coarse language that Trump and his fans had reveled in. Paulus described his victory over such qualms. “They had tried to get the township to take it down,” he said, smiling at the memory of the fight as he looked up at his sign. “But the township said it’s not coming down as ‘bitch’ is not a bad word. It’s a female dog.” Jan Evans, a devout 64-year-old Christian who runs a store making slogan t-shirts for the local schools’ sports teams, said she thought there were better ways to talk about people. But she sympathized with the sort of anxiety that moved people to support Trump. She recently learned that her monthly health insurance premiums under Obamacare, a healthcare law that Trump has said he will repeal and replace, would go from $120 to $357. But she worried that Trump’s victory would not help, either; she did not know what his healthcare plans were as he has not given details. She said that when she voted, she filled out down-ballot lines for local and state elections and left the presidential vote until the end to give her more time to think.  “Neither one really deserved it,” she said of Clinton and Trump. Her pen hovered for quite a while, but she declined to say where on the ballot it landed. “Everybody, they’re a little bit frightened, they’re hopeful, they know we need change,” she said of Trump’s victory. “But this is the change?” ",1
" (Refiles Nov. 30 story to cut extraneous word ‘against’ in 2nd paragraph; corrects garbled sentence in paragraph 17) By Katanga Johnson and Makini Brice WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Charles “Chuck” Johnson is not the kind of foot soldier in the army of lobbyists that House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan warned would descend on Washington to fight the biggest overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s. Johnson, 53, with a degree in social work and another from a  theological seminary, heads the National Council for Adoption, a small organization in Alexandria, Virginia that represents adoption agencies and adoption lawyers. Despite a relative lack of clout, parents of adopted children and adoption advocates beat back a minor change in the tax code that would have removed a tax credit to help cover the costs of adoption. Politics in Washington favors the moneyed and the connected, especially Big Business and special interest groups rich enough to employ legions of lobbyists to advocate on their behalf.  But many of the taxpayers affected by President Donald Trump’s tax overhaul have little or no influence on Congress, where Republicans are looking to end a host of tax credits and deductions for medical expenses, moving expenses and alimony in order to pay for their big tax cuts. The bill will cut corporate tax, provide a tax holiday for corporations’ overseas profits and cut the tax rate for the wealthy. “Everyone in corporate America had an army ready and in place to push for simplifying the tax code,” said Michaela Sims Stewart, president of the lobbying firm Sims Strategies.  In contrast, parents of adopted children “naturally came together” to form a “small but mighty group,” said Stewart.  Stewart also happens to be a spokeswoman for Adoption Tax Credit Working Group, which brought together a host of organizations, some with strong Republican and conservative ties, to pressure the House leadership to drop the change. Part of the tax code since 1998, the adoption tax credit was used by nearly 74,000 people in 2014, according to the Internal Revenue Service.  The adoption advocates started a social media campaign on Facebook and Twitter to alert parents of the change. “We expected adoptive families to rally in support, but when groups like Focus on the Family, National Right to Life, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, prominent clergy such as Russell Moore, and even the LGBT community joined, the media took an interest,” said Johnson, of the National Council for Adoption. With the publicity, pro-family Republican politicians were suddenly in the position of having to explain the elimination of what the coalition had successfully cast as a pro-child policy. The House proposal was dropped Nov. 2 and the Senate didn’t even bother to make it part of its version of the tax bill. While adoptive parents were ultimately successful in their fight, others have struggled to be heard. Graduate students staged walkouts on dozens of campuses this week to protest one Republican proposal that would increase their tax burden. It would require graduate students to pay taxes on tuition payments that are waived by their university as if it were income. In other words, the students would be required to pay taxes on money they never had to begin with.      Few of the Republican proposals to end deductions or tax credits will yield a lot of money for a government that spends $4 trillion a year. Ending alimony deductions, a benefit in the tax code since 1954, might raise $8.3 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. No longer letting teachers write off $250 of what they shell out of their own pocket for classroom supplies might yield $2.1 billion over the same period, the committee says. The change affecting adoption might bring in less than $50 million over the next decade. The committee did not break out what ending medical deductions would yield. Even though the stakes are high for them, advocates for people with disabilities and chronic diseases say they lagged in fighting cuts in medical expense deductibility, as well as removing a tax break to companies that make handicap-accessible structural changes, and a tax credit for businesses that hire people with disabilities. The tax breaks were not explicitly for people with disabilities, and the advocates had not expected they would be in Congress’s crosshairs.  These less-than-powerful voices may yet be heard as the Senate prepares to vote on its bill this week. They may get another chance when the House and Senate compromise on a single piece of legislation to vote on and pass to Trump.  ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The disputed acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said in a court filing on Friday that she plans to seek a preliminary injunction against rival acting director Mick Mulvaney and the Trump administration by Dec. 5. President Donald Trump named Mulvaney, the White House budget director, as acting director of the CFPB on Nov. 24 following the departure of the director, who had named the agency’s deputy director, Leandra English, to temporarily succeed him. A federal judge this week refused to block Trump’s appointment of Mulvaney to lead the consumer watchdog agency, but English is continuing to pursue the issue and indicated in a court filing she would file a motion of preliminary injunction against Mulvaney and the Trump administration by Dec. 5.

A further 2,500 are stranded in Panama s northern neighbor, Costa Rica, since the next country on the trail, Nicaragua, has tightened immigration controls.Colombian authorities say they have deported thousands of migrants trying to reach Panama from its northern territory.Varela said last week that many of the migrants were Haitians who had gone to Brazil after a 2010 earthquake devastated their country.Brazil s current deep recession has driven them to try to get to the United States through Central America.

"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile s presidential hopefuls wrapped up campaigning on Thursday in a race that has pitted billionaire Sebastian Pinera s promise for change against center-left candidate Alejandro Guillier s defense of a recent raft of progressive reforms. With their six rivals trailing far behind, Pinera and Guillier are widely expected to place first and second, respectively, in Sunday s election, allowing them to move on to an eventual Dec. 17 run-off. Pinera, a 67-year-old former president, has portrayed himself as the best bet for reviving growth that has slowed in recent years in the world s No.1 copper producer. He has vowed to cut the corporate tax rate and scale back outgoing President Michelle Bachelet s tax, labor and education reforms that Guillier has vowed to deepen. Bachelet cannot run for office again because of term limits.  Chileans face an important decision. They re going to have to choose between change or continuity,  Pinera told journalists on Thursday on the last day for campaigning before the election. Guillier, a bearded former journalist-turned-Senator, has tapped concerns that Pinera would mark a setback for gains made in Bachelet s government for students, women and workers - from lowered university fees to laws that have empowered unions.  This is an election to define the two Chiles,  Guillier said.  Support for education, health care and rights, or a return to the market.  Neither candidate marks a sharp departure from the historically moderate leaders that have governed Chile since the country s transition to democracy from dictatorship in 1990. But if Pinera wins as expected, this year s election would mark another rightward shift in South America following the rise of conservative leaders in Peru, Argentina and Brazil. Pinera s and Guillier s rivals passed out leaflets and chatted up voters in a final bid to shore up support, or at least help their parties win seats in the next Congress. Analyst group Tresquintos said leftist candidate Beatriz Sanchez, a distant third in opinion polls, has zero chance of catching up to Guillier. The probability of Pinera securing at least 50 percent of votes needed to avoid a runoff election was only slightly better at 0.001 percent, it added in an email. Still, riding high with more than double Guillier s support in recent polls, Pinera urged Chileans to  make it short  and vote for him on Sunday to give him an outright win. ",1
"JUBA (Reuters) - War-ravaged South Sudan is considering scrapping state subsidies on oil because it hasn t been able to pay civil servants for four months and diplomatic staff abroad are being evicted over unpaid rent, the deputy finance minister said.  Ending the subsidies would free up desperately needed cash, Mou Ambrose Thiik told Reuters in an interview.  Nearly four years of civil war have destroyed South Sudan s economy. Inflation was at 165 percent in August, the 21st consecutive month of triple-digit growth. The government depends on oil revenues, but attacks have slashed production to less than a third of pre-war levels.  The government expects to receive $820 million from oil this year. Out of that, $453 million will go to neighboring Sudan as payment for using its infrastructure for export; $183 million on the oil subsidy; and $166 million is allocated to the budget, which has a gaping deficit.   We were thinking that we would lift subsidies on the oil and will be able to cover this (deficit) and pay our salaries more easily,  said Thiik.  But we have some resistance from the parliament.  Lawmaker Nailo Mayo, the chair of the finance committee, said parliamentarians just wanted more information on who might be affected by ending the subsidies.   The committee ... is concerned about the social cost, I mean the suffering that could accrue to the poorer section of the community, and also we are afraid of the political cost, that is stability, arising from lack of transport,  he said.  State-subsidized oil sells at 22 South Sudanese pounds (SSP) per liter, but severe shortages mean many people buy it on the black market for 300 SSP per liter. The SSP trades at about 17.5 to the dollar on the black market and 17.68 at the central bank.  The process for allocating subsidized fuel, which is purchased with government-issued coupons, is unclear. South Sudan s conflict began in 2013 after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy, Riek Machar, a Nuer. The conflict degenerated into ethnic fighting marked by widespread sexual violence.  Out of an original population of 12 million, 4 million have fled their homes. More than half of those who remain in South Sudan need food aid and nearly three-quarters of children are out of school. Thiik acknowledged social services were dire and said the finance ministry was trying to save money. It wants to reduce the number of embassies by a third, he said, because it is unable to fund them.   They (embassy staff) didn t get their salary for seven months and also they have arrears in their premises,  he said.  Asked about civil servants who had not been paid for four months, he said:  it is true that we have not secured money to pay salaries.    ",1

"THE CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES is a great resource for all the facts on illegals and taxpayer dollars. Patty and I were lucky enough to attend a two-day workshop with them in DC. The main fact that stuck with us is that the current immigration system is UNSUSTAINABLE They used facts and figures to lay out the truth for us and it was frightening! This is why it is even more frightening that the feds are STILL giving preferential treatment to illegals when it comes to SNAP.CIS s David North gives us the low down:It s been six months since Donald Trump took office, and some families with illegal aliens get food stamps (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) while identical all-citizen families of the same size and with the same income do not receive them.This is not a question of treating illegal aliens like other residents of this country, it is clear-cut discrimination against citizens and in favor of illegals.This long-standing (and peculiar) arrangement is the sort of thing that one would expect to be corrected by the third, if not the first, month of a new get-tough-on-illegal-immigration administration, such as that of the campaigning Donald Trump.I checked with the Department of Agriculture s Food and Nutrition Service this week, the $110 billion-a-year agency that runs food stamps and some other nutrition programs.Two questions were on my mind: 1) does the food stamp program still, under a particular set of circumstances, operate with this anti-citizen bias, and 2) has the Trump administration made an appointment of one or more outsiders to help run the agency?The answer to the second question came quickly: No, but there is a civil servant running the program on an acting basis who was placed in that job by the White House. Does an agency have to have a budget of, say, $200 billion a year before the administration notices its existence?It took a little longer to get the answer to the first question, because the nature of the discrimination is subtle and a lot of professionals in the welfare business do not want to make the distinction between legal and illegal residents of this country.Here s how the system works: Illegal aliens are not allocated food stamps, but if the family is mixed, with some citizens and some illegals, the mixed family still gets some benefits. States are allowed, to some extent, to pick and choose among benefit-determination methods. Most states have chosen a technique that does not record some of the earnings of illegal aliens, while always recording all the income of citizens.Let s look at the system as applied to two similar families who live in adjacent houses; both have incomes of $2,400 a month, both have the same assets, both families consist of a working male, his stay-at-home spouse, and their stay-at-home toddler. The only difference is that one of the men is a native-born citizen and the other is an illegal alien. Everyone else in the two households is a citizen.OK, so far. Now let s walk through Alice s special mirror, and see how the government handles the situation. It sees the three-citizen family as three people and says that $2,400 a month is too high an income for food stamps. It looks at the other family and sees it as a two-member family, because the man is an illegal, and then   here s the key   the government decides that only two-thirds of the family income should be counted, and that $1,600 is not too high for a family of two, hence the family with the illegal alien in it gets food stamps and the other family does not.There are bands of income in which this situation plays out with different sized families, giving benefits to some mixed families, and denying them to all-citizen families of the same size and with the same income. For more on these strange arrangements, see the CIS report  An Aid Program that Routinely Discriminates in Favor of Ineligible Aliens .That s the way it was under Obama, and after I explained the (admittedly bizarre) matter to the Food and Nutrition Service publicist, she told me that it remains that way under Trump.This story is symptomatic of two larger realities. Both the Obama and Trump administrations managed to conduct big immigration operations to their own liking; think of DACA with Obama, and, under Trump, the way that enforcement people were given the freedom to do their jobs.But Obama was much more successful in the minutia of immigration policy than Trump; for years I wrote about this little move to admit a small class of migrants, or that little move that prevented another subclass from being deported. We are not seeing that, or maybe not yet, with the Trump administration. You can t change policy, at least at the retail level, without people to write and push the new policies.So an unknown but substantial number of mixed (illegals plus citizens) families are getting food stamps when equally poor neighbors, who happen to be in all-citizen families, go hungry.Read more and please check out the CIS websiteJESSICA VAUGHAN OF CIS DISCUSSES EXPEDITED REMOVAL OF ILLEGALS UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION:Please use this website as a resource for facts when it comes to immigration!",0
"Donald Trump hates losing. Not because it s a loss to his agenda, or a perceived loss to the American people. Trump hates losing because it hurt his paper thin ego and when he does lose, there s hell to pay (or at least threatened hell to pay). Trump suffered another major loss in court after a 9th Circuit Court judge ruled against his attempt at defundng sanctuary cities. Now, like a true dictator, Trump wants to break up the 9th Circuit.In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Trump said about breaking up the court: Absolutely, I have,  Trump said of considering 9th Circuit breakup proposals during a far-ranging interview with the Washington Examiner at the White House.  There are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit. It s outrageous. He then accused liberal plaintiffs of court shopping for a more sympathetic body. Everybody immediately runs to the 9th Circuit. And we have a big country. We have lots of other locations. But they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. Because they know that s like, semi-automatic,  Trump said.The 9th Circuit, which covers nine western states and Guam, is based in San Francisco. San Francisco is, of course, one of the sanctuary cities, so plaintiffs didn t have go far to land on their docket.While the 9th has had some liberal rulings:Covering a huge swath of territory   nine western states plus Guam   the San Francisco-based court handles far more cases than any other federal appeals court, including some rulings that have invoked furor from conservatives over the years. Among them: finding that the phrase  under God  in the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional, that the  don t ask, don t tell  policy on gays in the military was problematic long before President Barack Obama s administration ended it, and that states can force pharmacies to dispense emergency contraceptives.Source: Mercury NewsThey are far more balanced than right-wingers would let on.But some legal scholars say the 9th Circuit s liberal reputation is overblown and that the court has moved to the middle as some of President Jimmy Carter s appointees   who were considered extremely liberal   have taken semi-retired  senior  status or passed away. A Democratic Congress nearly doubled the number of judges on the court during Carter s tenure, and his appointees faced easy confirmation in the Senate.President George W. Bush appointed six of the court s 25 active judges, but 18 have been appointed by Democrats, though the seven appointed by President Barack Obama are generally considered moderate, said University of Richmond Law School Professor Carl Tobias.Still, conservatives, and especially Trump, would like nothing more than to make California even less relevant in national politics (a vote in California is worth less than 1/3 of a vote in Wyoming).The bigger picture behind Trump s threat is far more disturbing. We have three (supposedly) co-equal branches of government. Trump is trying to use his executive powers to shut down any dissenting views, even from another branch. Even if you are a Trump voter, you should find this very disconcerting.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",0
"LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal s government on Tuesday survived a no confidence vote in parliament called by the opposition which alleged the government had failed to protect the lives of 110 people who died in two wildfire tragedies in the past four months. This year s fires in Portugal - one in June which killed 65 people and others last week which overwhelmed fire-fighting services and killed 45 people - are the worst on record and led to the resignation of the interior minister. The motion was presented by the center-right CDS-PP after a  barrage of criticism of the Socialist government of Prime Minister Antonio Costa. But the Socialists, together with their far-left parliamentary allies, the Communists and Left Bloc, rejected the motion in parliament by 122 to 105. The lethal wildfires are the biggest challenge faced by the government since it came to power in 2015 and have highlighted a glaring divide between the poor, abandoned interior of Portugal and its coastal, urban centers.   The government failed because its political leaders didn t know how to coordinate or execute a policy capable of stopping the fires,  CDS-PP party leader Assuncao Cristas told parliament during the debate.  Thousands of Portuguese waited for help which never came.  The government says extraordinary weather conditions, including unusually strong winds and extreme drought, made the fires very difficult to avoid. Portugal s yearly summer fires rarely kill civilians. Facing a growing backlash, including protests and demands for action by the president, the government announced a series of measures at the weekend.  We are here because the suffering of the victims and their families and the feeling of insecurity of the Portuguese demands a response,  Prime Minister Costa told parliament during the debate on the motion.  A report on the fire in June pointed to a long list of mistakes, including slow response times by the police, firefighters and civil protection agency. A special communication system for emergencies stopped working during the fire. This year s fires in Portugal accounted for 60 percent of the total area burnt in the entire European Union. Portugal is equal to 2.1 percent of the EU s landmass. In the interior, many have clamored for years for deep changes to land management to prevent fires, by creating viable forestry and farm units that will make land more valuable.   ",1

"Republicans are apparently hell-bent on destroying public education any way they can. The Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as secretary of education in a 51-50 vote on Tuesday. And as if that weren t enough, a GOP representative introduced a bill to do away with the Department of Education entirely.Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie introduced the one-page bill, which states that the Department of Education would terminate on Dec. 31, 2018. Now, to be honest, I could understand if this were a panicked, knee-jerk reaction to DeVos  confirmation. Kind of a  smoosh it before it lays eggs  response. It wouldn t make it a good idea, but it would be understandable. Sadly, that doesn t appear to be the case at all.Massie wants to eliminate the agency, which has been in place since 1980, because he just doesn t think the federal government should be in charge of education. Instead, he thinks the issue would best be left to states and local municipalities. (Insert eye roll here.) Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children s intellectual and moral development. States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students,  Massie said in a statement.Massie isn t alone on this one, as seven other Republicans have also signed onto his bill: House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (Utah) and Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Jody Hice (Ga.), Walter Jones (N.C.) and Ra l Labrador (Idaho).The bill was introduced shortly after Vice President Mike Pence cast his tie-breaking to confirm DeVos. All Democrats voted against her and two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), broke ranks with their party and opposed her confirmation as well.

"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThis week a House Judiciary Committee began overseeing details of a US Federal Court case between tech company Apple and the FBI.On February 16th, Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly rejected a court order to decrypt an iPhone said to be connected to the San Bernardino mass-shooting case from December of 2015.The House Judiciary Committee listened to the controversial case between tech titan Apple and the FBI a day after Magistrate Judge James Orenstein of New York, struck down a federal court order pressuring Apple to help access encrypted data in a separate case involving illegal drug trafficking.The landmark decision made by Judge Orenstein stated that the All Writs Act of 1789 (also used as the FBI s main argument in the Apple/San Bernardino case) does not permit a court to order companies to pull encrypted data off a customer s phone or tablet,  according to a recent article from The Washington Post.The Post continued by discussing Orenstein s lengthy argument against the FBI s order against Apple in the drug related case: In a 50-page opinion disdainful of the government s arguments, Orenstein found that the All Writs Act does not apply in instances where Congress had the opportunity but failed to create an authority for the government to get the type of help it was seeking, such as having firms ensure they have a way to obtain data from encrypted phones. In addition, The Post outlined some of the social engineering aspects involved in the lead up to the FBI drug case overseen by Judge Orenstein, a case which has arguably been a part of an overarching back drop concerning the larger San Bernardino case: The Brooklyn case began last fall when Orenstein, one of a handful of magistrates across the country who are activists in the surveillance debate, received the government s application to issue an order to Apple. While Apple has previously helped the federal government with some 70 phone cases since 2008, Judge Orenstein examined several problems with the FBI s use of the All Writs Act: In an Oct. 9 ruling, Orenstein identified what he thought was a problem with the government s argument. Though prosecutors cited a 1985 decision that found that the All Writs Act is a source of authority to issue writs  not otherwise covered by statute,  he said they failed to cite another part of the decision that found that the act does not authorize the issuance of  ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate. The new ruling in the FBI drug case will likely have a heavy impact on the eventual ruling in the San Bernardino/Apple court order, as it directly questions the heart of the government s argument to gain easier access to encrypted consumer data.It s also interesting to note, that it was the FBI who put themselves in this position regarding the San Bernardino phone as they reportedly ordered the password to be reset via iCloud shortly after the apparent mass shooting.You have to wonder why the agency would have ordered a new password almost immediately following the highly dramatic scene in San Bernardino   INVENTIONS OF REALITY?    Is this latest  privacy crisis  a manufactured drama or a legitimate battle for those in the tech industry? (Photo illustration 21WIRE)What s interesting here, is that ABC news reported on December 3rd, a day after the apparent shooting,  Sources say mobile phones, hard drives, virtually anything with digital memory that was associated with the alleged shooters   Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik   was smashed. Adding to that, we ve mentioned a number of times here at 21WIRE, that none of the eyewitness testimony mentioned seeing a female shooter at the scene of the Inland Regional Center in the aftermath of the San Bernardino shooting.A Right to PrivacyIn our previous article detailing the ongoing encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.In a recent Guardian article, some of those involved in the technology and security sector offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy:Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Kaminsky further explained why Apple s security measures already help law enforcement, If my iPhone is stolen, my emails stay unread, my photos stay unviewed, and I don t need to notify anyone that the secrets they entrusted me with are going to show up on the internet tomorrow. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently at judicial think-tank the Brennan Center. The following is a portion of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Additionally, there are many who believe weaker encryption may pose an even bigger security risk globally.In many ways, it appears as though federal agencies are seemingly searching for the right crisis to push public opinion in favor of the state when it comes to security.This is at the core of the perpetual privacy and security battle post 9/11   TARGETING PRIVACY    FBI Director James Comey speaking at the Brookings Institution in October of 2014 about Going Dark. (Photo link brookings)Shining a Light on the FBI  Going Dark Last September, The Washington Post published an article entitled, Obama faces growing momentum to support widespread encryption,   and within its contents, perhaps the true nature of the security/privacy issue was laid bare (hat tip saperetic): Privately, law enforcement officials have acknowledged that prospects for congressional action this year are remote. Although  the legislative environment is very hostile today,  the intelligence community s top lawyer, Robert S. Litt, said to colleagues in an August e-mail, which was obtained by The Post,  it could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement. There is value, he said, in  keeping our options open for such a situation. Interestingly, in October of 2014, FBI Director James B. Comey, explained while speaking at the Brookings Institution he was  focused on trying to get the law changed  so that tech companies would have to comply with law enforcement to unlock data on various devices.Continuing, he outlined the current security agenda concerning the FBI,  We have the legal authority to intercept and access communications and information pursuant to a court order, but we often lack the technical ability to do that. The Brookings speech from 2014, appeared in stark contrast with a recent emotionally driven op-ed Comey wrote for Lawfare entitled  We Could Not Look the Survivors in the Eye if We Did Not Follow this Lead. Here s a passage from that piece, that clearly displays the conflicting message of the FBI director: We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That s it. We don t want to break anyone s encryption or set a master key loose on the land. The Guardian refers to this as a  two-pronged approach  on the public s senses   as one tone from the FBI comes across as caring and the other seems more focused on the greater, nationalistic implications of encryption.Think good cop/bad cop hovering over you in an interrogation room and you d be getting very warm.This is the kind of psychological drama that has prompted some in media to think that the law enforcement agency has been exploiting the public in the wake of tragedy, in order to increase security measures.This is absolutely something to watch.So, what are we to make of the FBI s claims of going dark in the digital age?It has long since been claimed that intelligence agencies fear going dark in the age of high-tech gadgetry. This idea is vastly overblown and not rooted in reality, especially when you consider the many revelations concerning NSA spying, collection of bulk metadata and other tracking programs such as the IMSI catcher, otherwise known as Stingray (Stingray acts as cell tower locking onto all devices in a certain area) intercepts phone calls, texts, as well as your location.The very notion that law enforcement will somehow be condemned eternally to outdated methods to catch criminals in the future   is patently absurd.Furthermore, the concept and presentation of the FBI s  going dark  scenario is nothing more than a talking point used to increase a police state apparatus within the United States.Don t PanicOn February 1st, a group of experts published report regarding the current status of law enforcement and their ability to keep up with the demands of crime solving in the world today. The lengthy report entitled  Don t Panic was compiled by The Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. Here s a passage below examining the FBI s catchy mantra,  Going Dark :The U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities view this trend with varying degrees of alarm, alleging that their interception capabilities are  going dark.  As they describe it, companies are increasingly adopting technological architectures that inhibit the government s ability to obtain access to communications, even in circumstances that satisfy the Fourth Amendment s warrant requirements. Encryption is the hallmark of these architectures. Government officials are concerned because, without access to communications, they fear they may not be able to prevent terrorist attacks and investigate and prosecute criminal activity. Their solution is to force companies to maintain access to user communications and data, and provide that access to law enforcement on demand, pursuant to the applicable legal process. However, the private sector has resisted.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea expects more provocative acts by North Korea next month, to coincide with the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean communist party and China s all-important Communist Party Congress. During a meeting with President Moon Jae-in on Thursday, national security adviser Chung Eui-yong said he expected Pyongyang to act around Oct. 10 and 18, but gave no details. The South Korean security adviser s report also pointed to the risk that a military conflict could by sparked by  accidental incidents,  said Park Wan-ju, a lawmaker and head spokesman of the ruling Democratic Party.  The president said the United States speaks of military and diplomatic options, but South Korea can t go through war again,  said Park. Tension on the Korean peninsula has risen in recent weeks as North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump exchanged war-like threats and insults over the North s nuclear and missile development program. The North has accused Trump of declaring war after he warned Kim s regime would not last if he persisted in threatening the United States and its allies, having earlier warned North Korea would be totally destroyed in such an event. Asked if China had a plan to respond to an emergency in North Korea, such as securing nuclear and missile sites, Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian said,  Military means cannot become an option,  and urged talks to resolve the issue. The Chinese military will make all necessary preparations to protect the country s sovereignty and security and regional peace and stability,  he added, without elaborating. China has vowed to uphold U.N. sanctions against North Korea, besides seeking to get stalled talks restarted with Pyongyang. On Thursday, China s commerce ministry said North Korean firms or joint ventures in China would be shut within 120 days of the latest United Nations Security Council sanctions passed on Sept. 12. Overseas Chinese joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals will also be closed, the ministry said in a statement on its website, without providing a timeframe. The ministry had issued similar rules after a previous set of U.N. sanctions in August. Pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 and has launched dozens of missiles this year as it accelerates a program aimed at eventually targeting the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. China, the North s main ally, would probably be extremely unhappy if Pyongyang tested a missile or carried out some other act during its Communist Party Congress, held every five years. Park said President Moon told the meeting that Washington and Seoul agreed that pressure needed to be applied to North Korea, with the door to talks still open. In a separate speech on Thursday, Moon said cooperation with the international community to curb the North s nuclear ambitions was at its highest ever and called for the strengthening of South Korea-U.S. defenses to rein in the North.  Expulsion of North Korean diplomats has been among the measures countries have taken against the reclusive state since its latest nuclear test. Malaysia banned citizens from traveling to North Korea, citing the escalating tension on the Korean peninsula. South Korean lawmakers said Chung had told them the United States and South Korea had agreed on the rotational deployment of U.S. strategic assets to South Korea, possibly as soon as year-end. The nature of the assets was not specified.  President Moon added it was inappropriate to discuss the deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea, the lawmakers said.  Moon said he had opposed the deployment of U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in South Korea, but rapid improvement in North Korea s missile capabilities prompted the decision. China opposes the deployment of THAAD because it believes its powerful radar could be used to look inside its territory. South Korea and the United States have said it is only to curb North Korea s missile threats. ",1
"CNN has been heavily criticized for its coverage of Donald Trump s rise and rightfully so. For months, one of the most watched news networks in America deferred to the  both sides  model of false equivalency that had been standard practice for years. Recently, as Trump clinched the Republican nomination and it became clear that he has no intention of being  more presidential,  something in the minds of the network s reporters and hosts  clicked.  They finally seem to get it. Donald Trump is a despicable person and no amount of  he said, she said  is going to blunt that fact.So they ve changed. And in doing so have absolutely upped their game.On a recent episode of At This Hour, hosts John Berman and Kate Bolduan put on a masterclass on how to press a Trump supporter to get right down to the uncomfortable truth at the very root of Trump s campaign. They invited on freshman congressman Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) and slowly demolished his talking points. Watching a human being get so thoroughly decimated is never easy, but given Zeldin s baffling support for Trump it s hard to say he didn t have it coming. He knows Trump is a racist   just ask him.After Zeldin tried to dismiss Trump s comments about his Hispanic judge as a  regrettable mistake,  the pair of hosts didn t let him off the hook. If Donald Trump is engaging in racism, are you still comfortable supporting him? Zeldin tried to change the subject, as he no doubt was trained to do. But Bolduan and Berman weren t buying it. After trying to use the opportunity to pivot to bashing Hillary Clinton, Bolduan interrupts. I m not saying Are you now voting for Hillary Clinton? , but are you still endorsing Donald Trump if you think he s engaging in racism? Well, yes, it s Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton and it s a no brainer between the two of them Are you essentially saying  Yes he s a racist, but he s our racist ? Boom!Zeldin has to admit that while Trump s comments are indeed racist, he thinks in Trump s  heart  that he isn t a white supremacist. (A tip for any aspiring politicians: If you have to go on national television to tepidly argue that deep inside your candidate isn t as racist as he looks, you ve already lost.)Again Berman holds his feet to the fire: Sorry but what would you call someone who makes racist statements? Everyone calls them a racist. So if Donald Trump is making racist statements, you re saying he s a racist! Hahaha.The exchange ends with Zeldin throwing up the last, most desperate argument he and his party has in their playbook: Trump may be a racist, but Obama is a bigger racist. The look on the hosts  faces is absolutely priceless.Watch the full, cringeworthy exchange below:Featured image via CNN",0
"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri resigned on Saturday, saying he believed there was an assassination plot against him and accusing Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world. His resignation, a big surprise to Beirut s political establishment, brought down the coalition government and plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis.  It thrust Lebanon into the front line of a regional competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain. A Saudi government minister said Hariri was in Riyadh to ensure his safety.  Hariri, who is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, alleged in a broadcast from an undisclosed location that Hezbollah was  directing weapons  at Yemenis, Syrians and Lebanese. In comments directed at Iran, he said the Arab world would  cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it . Hariri s coalition, which took office last year, grouped nearly all of Lebanon s main parties, including Hezbollah. It took office in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, president, and was seen as a victory for Iran. The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government. An official at the U.S. State Department said it was following the situation closely and noted that Hariri had been a  strong partner in building strong national state institutions and in the war on terror . The official added  the United States expects an orderly political process in Lebanon and will remain supportive of the legitimate institutions of the Lebanese state . It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon s most influential Sunni politician. The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon s sectarian system. Aoun must appoint the candidate with most support among MPs, who he is expected to consult in the coming days.  We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri. I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life,  Hariri said.  Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son Saad into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies involvement. The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source.  Saudi Arabia s Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan said in a television interview that Hariri s personal security detail had  confirmed information  of a plot to kill him.      Lebanon s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter. Hariri said Hezbollah and Iran had brought Lebanon into the  eye of a storm  of international sanctions. Iran was sowing strife, destruction and ruin wherever it went and he accused it of a  deep hatred for the Arab nation . Aoun s office said Hariri had called him from  outside Lebanon  to inform him of his resignation. He has postponed a visit to Kuwait and directed military and security agencies  to maintain stability , it said. Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Velayati described Hariri s coalition as  a victory  and  great success . Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, will address Hariri s resignation in a televised speech on Sunday, Hezbollah-affiliated media reported.  A member of Hezbollah s central committee, Sheikh Nabil Kawouk, accused Riyadh of being behind Hariri s resignation, saying in a speech reported by Lebanon s al-Jadeed television:  God protect Lebanon from the evil of Saudi Arabia s reckless adventures.   Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon s Druze minority, said Lebanon was too weak to bear the consequences of Hariri s resignation, saying he feared political and economic fallout.  We cannot afford to fight the Iranians from Lebanon,  he told Reuters, advocating an approach of compromise with Hezbollah in Lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow Saudi-Iranian dialogue.  Iran s Foreign Ministry said Hariri s departure was a plot to  create tension in Lebanon and the region .   Hariri s resignation was done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,  said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iran s supreme leader. Sabhan, the Saudi minister, echoed the language of the Lebanese politician saying in a tweet:  The hands of treachery and aggression must be cut off.   Israeli politicians also used Hariri s resignation to criticize Iranian influence in Lebanon.  His words are a wake-up call to the international community to take action against Iranian aggression,  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Hezbollah s close ties to Iran and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war with rebels have been a major source of tension in Lebanon for years. Beirut has adopted a position of  disassociation  from the conflict, but this has come under strain with Hezbollah and its allies pushing for a normalization of ties. Since taking office, Hariri had worked to garner international aid for Lebanon to cope with the strain of hosting some 1.5 million Syrian refugees. The government s collapse complicates preparations for next year s parliamentary elections, Lebanon s first since 2009. Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters there was no danger to Lebanon s economy or its currency. Joseph Torbey, head of the Association of Banks in Lebanon, said there was no risk to monetary stability because the central bank had large reserves and there was confidence in Lebanese banks. Lebanon has one of the world s highest ratios of debt-to-GDP and last month passed its first budget since 2005, one of the few achievements of the coalition government.  The United States is considering new sanctions on Hezbollah, as part of a tougher stance against Iran and its allies, that Lebanese politicians have fretted could hurt the economy. ",1
"It sure would be nice to have a President and Congress who took this whole illegal alien thing seriously IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the IRS wants to continue to allow illegal aliens to use stolen social security numbers to file tax returns without allowing the numbers to be used for  bad  reasons. Koskinen said it s in everyone s interest to have illegal aliens paying taxes.Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) asked the Koskinen to explain the policy after revealing that his staff looked into IRS procedures and found that,  the IRS continues to process tax returns with false W-2 information and issue refunds as if they were routine tax returns, and say that s not really our job. What happens in these situations is someone is using a Social Security number to get a job, but they re filing their tax return with their [taxpayer identification number],   Koskinen said.  They are undocumented aliens   . They re paying taxes. It s in everybody s interest to have them pay the taxes they owe. Sen. Coats also revealed that the IRS ignores notifications from the Social Security Administration when a name and SSN does not match and that IRS agents are prohibited from informing the victims of employment-related identity theft even though the agency identified 200,000 new cases last year.Koskinen explained that as long as they were using the stolen SSNs to only illegally obtain a job that they would allow them to continue to use the number in order to file taxes, since the IRS uses the taxpayer identification number (ITIN) to process the tax return. The question is whether the Social Security number they re using to get the job has been stolen. It s not the normal identity theft situation,  Koskinen said.The topic of the hearing was to address the cybersecurity failings of the IRS to protect taxpayer data. In February 2016 about 464,000 of these stolen SSNs were targeted by hackers in a cyber breach. The agency said it wants to differentiate the  bad  misuse of personal data from other uses.

"The politically correct country of Sweden paying a very big price for their kindness, generosity and open-borders policy This attack happened in Norrmalmstorg, Stockholm. The two Swedes told them not to vandalize flowerpots   and as a response they got beaten up for it.https://youtu.be/Rsn_1TO1kMUThis is indeed the future of Europe. By their irresponsible, short-sighted, suicidal immigration and refugee policies, Europe s political and media elites have ensured a future of violence, bloodshed and chaos for their people. Sweden, the future of Europe: people stock up on fire arms, police recommend vigilante groups ,  by Nicolai Sennels, 10News.dk, December 12, 2015 (thanks to TheReligionofPeace.com):This is a very interesting read, because the whole of Europe is heading the same way as Sweden. Sweden is, so to speak, the future of Europe. And in this future, those who can afford it pay security companies   the rest gest license for firearms and forms vigilante groups. via: Pamela Gellar You have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places.    Salesman for alarm systems.Since Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by over 300% and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The violence at the hands of Muslim migrants  is nothing new to Sweden. This horrific video was published in 2013:Many Swedes see the mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him, even though he beats her and treats her badly. Her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated?    Alexandra von Schwerin, whose farm who was robbed three times. Police refused to help.Once upon a time, there was a safe welfare state called Sweden, where people rarely locked their doors.Now, this country is a night-watchman state   each man is on his own. When the Minister of Justice, Morgan Johansson, encourages breaking the law, it means opening the gates to anarchy. Mr. and Mrs. Swede have every reason to be worried, with the influx of 190,000 unskilled and unemployed migrants expected this year   equivalent to 2% of Sweden s current population. The number is as if 6.4 million penniless migrants who did not speak English arrived in U.S. in one year, or 1.3 million in Britain.And the Swedes are preparing: demand for firearms licenses is increasing; more and more Swedes are joining shooting clubs and starting vigilante groups. After a slight dip in 2014, the number of new gun permits has gone up significantly again this year. According to police statistics, there are 1,901,325 licensed guns, owned by 567,733 people, in Sweden. Add to this an unknown number of illegal weapons. To get a gun permit in Sweden, you need to be at least 18 years old; law-abiding; well-behaved, and have a hunting license or be a member of an approved shooting club. In 2014, 11,000 people got a hunting license: 10% more than the year before. One out of five was a woman. There is also a high demand for alarm systems right now,  says a salesman at one of the security companies in an interview with Gatestone. It is largely due to the turbulence we are seeing around the country at the moment.  People have lost confidence in the State, he added.  The police will not come anymore. Truck drivers say that when they see a thief emptying the fuel tank of their trucks, they run out with a baseball bat. It is no use calling the police, but if you hit the thief, you can at least prevent him from stealing more diesel. Many homeowners say the same thing: they sleep with a baseball bat under the bed. But this is risky: the police can then say you have been prepared to use force, and that might backfire on you. The salesman, who asked to remain anonymous, also spoke of Sweden s many Facebook groups, in which people in different villages openly discuss how they intend to protect themselves:  Sometimes you get totally freaked out when you see what they are writing. But you have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places. One blog, detailing the consequences for the local population when an asylum facility opens, is aptly named Asylkaos ( Asylum Chaos ). There is a list of companies the reader is prompted to boycott; the blog claims these businesses encourage the transformation of Sweden to a multicultural society, and are therefore considered  hostile to Swedes. At another security company, a salesman said that every time the Immigration Service buys or rents a new housing facility, his firm is swamped with calls.  The next day,  he said,  half the village calls and wants to buy alarm systems. Ronny Fredriksson, spokesman of the security company Securitas, said that the demand for home alarm systems first exploded about six years ago, when many local police stations were shut down and police moved to the main towns. This, he said, could result in response times of several hours.  More and more people now employ the services of our security guards. Shopping malls and stores in the city come together and hire guards. We are kind of like the  local beat  cops of old. Even though Securitas makes big money from the increased need for home security alarms and security guards, Fredriksson says they also are worried about the effect on society: The problem is that we too need the police. When our guards catch a burglar or a violent person, we call the police but the response times are often very long. Sometimes, the detainees get violent and quite rowdy. On occasion, the police have told us to release the person we have apprehended, if we have his identity, because they do not have a patrol nearby. Even before the massive influx of migrants in the fall of 2015, Swedes felt a need to protect themselves   and with good reason. Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by more than 300%, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The politicians, however, ignore the people s fear completely. It is never discussed. Instead, the people who express concern about what kind of country Sweden has become are accused of xenophobia and racism. Most likely, that is the reason more and more people are taking matters into their own hands, and protecting themselves and their families to the best of their ability.All the same, some people do not settle for that. It seems some people are trying to stop mass immigration to Sweden. Almost every day there are reports of fires being set at asylum houses. So far, miraculously, no one has been hurt.These fires are set not only by Swedes. On October 13, a 36-year-old woman living in Skellefte  was convicted of setting fire to the asylum facility in which she herself resided. The woman claimed she lit a candle and then fell asleep. Yet forensic evidence showed that a combustible fluid had been doused throughout the room, and the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that she herself had ignited the fire.The number of violent incidents at Sweden s Immigration Service facilities is now sky-high. In 2013, according to Dispatch International, at least one incident happened every day. When Gatestone Institute recently acquired the incident list for January 1, 2014 through October 29, 2015, that number had risen to 2,177 incidents of threats, violence and brawls   on average, three per day.The Swedish government, however, would apparently rather not talk about that. Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr m conceded, in an interview with the daily Dagens Nyheter that garnered international attention, that Sweden is, in fact, heading for a systemic breakdown: Most people seem to think we cannot maintain a system where perhaps 190,000 people will arrive every year. In the long run, our system will collapse. This welcome is not going to receive popular support. We want to give people who come here a worthy reception. Symptomatic of Swedish journalists, this statement was tucked away at the end of the article. The headline was about how the political party that is critical of immigration, the Sweden Democrats Party (Sverigedemokraterna), is responsible for the asylum-housing fires. But foreign media, such as The Daily Mail and Russia Today, picked up Wallstr m s warning about a systemic collapse and ran it as the urgent news it actually is.Nevertheless, in official Sweden, the imminent collapse is ignored. Instead, journalists exclusively focus on attacks by supposedly  racist  Swedes on refugee centers. To prevent new fires, the Immigration Service decided on October 28 that from now on, all asylum facilities would have secret addresses. And meager police resources will now be stretched even further   to protect asylum seekers. Police helicopters will even patrol refugee centers. But considering there are only five helicopters available, and that Sweden s landmass is 407,340 square km (157,274 square miles), this gesture is effectively empty.At a meeting with the Nordic Council in Reykjavik, Iceland, on October 27, Sweden s Prime Minister, Stefan L fven, was questioned by his Nordic colleagues about the situation in Sweden. L fven had recently said that,  We should have the option of relocating people applying for asylum in Sweden to other EU-countries. Our ability, too, has a limit. We are facing a paradigm shift.  That comment led a representative of Finland s Finns Party (Sannfinl ndarna) to wonder, with a hint of irony, how mass immigration to Sweden, which for years Swedish politicians have touted as being so profitable, has now suddenly become a burden.Another Finns Party representative, Simon Elo, pointed out that the situation in Sweden is out of control.  Sweden has great abilities, but not even the Swedes have abilities that great,  Elo said.When L fven was asked how he is dealing with the real concerns and demands of the citizenry, his answer was laconic:  Of course I understand there is concern,  L fven said.  It is not easy. But at the same time   there are 60 million people on the run. This is also about them being our fellow men, and I hope that viewpoint will prevail. The daily tabloid Expressen asked L fven about the attacks on asylum facilities. He replied,  Our communities should not be characterized by threats and violence, they should be warm and show solidarity. As if such behavior can be forced.Many Swedes see mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him even though he beats her and treats her badly. And on top of that, her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him.More and more Swedish commentators are now drawing the same conclusion: that Sweden is teetering on the brink of collapse. Editorial columnist Ivar Arpi of the daily Svenska Dagbladet, wrote an astonishing article on October 26, about a woman named Alexandra von Schwerin and her husband. The couple lives on the Skarhults Estate farm in Sk ne in southern Sweden; they have been robbed three times. Most recently, they were robbed of a quad bike, a van and a car. When the police arrived, von Schwerin asked them what she should do. The police told her that they could not help her.  All our resources are on loan to the asylum reception center in Trelleborg and Malm ,  they said.  We are overloaded right now. So I suggest you get in touch with the vigilante group in Esl v. What the police had called a  vigilante group  turned out to be a group of private business owners. In 2013, after being robbed more or less every night, they had decided to come together and start patrolling the area themselves. Currently, they pay a security firm to watch their facilities. On principal, I am totally against it,  von Schwerin said.  What are the people who cannot afford private security to do? They will be unprotected. I m sure I will join, but very, very reluctantly. For the first time, I feel scared to live here now. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated? Commenting on the police s encouraging people to join vigilante groups, social commentator and former Refugee Ombudsman Merit Wager wrote: So, the Swedes are supposed to arrange and pay for their own and their families  security and keep their farms from being subjected to theft, even though that has up to now been included in the social contract   for which we pay high taxes, to have police we can count on to protect us and apprehend criminals?! When did the social contract expire? October 2015? Without any notice of termination, since the tax-consuming party is not fulfilling its part of the deal? This should mean that our part of the deal   to pay taxes for public, joint services   has also become invalid? If the social contract is broken, it is broken. Then it is musical chairs (lawlessness, defenselessness, without protection), and that means that each and every one of us should pay less taxes. Ilan Sad , lawyer and social commentator, wrote about the refugee chaos at Malm  Central Train Station on the blog Det Goda Samh llet on October 27:  The authorities no longer honor the social contract.  He described four large signs on display around the station that read  Refugee? Welcome to Malm !  in four different languages. It is unclear who the sender of the message is, or, for that matter, who is in charge of the reception facility   a number of barracks by the old post office in the inner harbor. Everything is utterly confusing. It could be Malm  City or the Immigration Service, but it might as well be  Refugees Welcome,  or possibly a religious community. I think to myself that a government agency could not reasonably write like this, a correct and pertinent sign would say something like:  Asylum seekers are referred to the barracks for information and further transport.  But I am probably wrong; Malm  City is the chief suspect communicant.   The signs in and around the Central Station are symptoms of something incredibly serious: Role confusion and the decay of the constitutional state. And thus, that our authorities no longer honor the social contract. In a post called Anarchy, blogger Johan Westerholm, who is a Social Democratic Party member and a critic of the government, wrote that the Minister for Justice and Migration, Morgan Johansson, is now urging authorities to  be pragmatic  about laws and regulations (concerning asylum housing for so-called unaccompanied refugee children). Westerholm stated that this is tantamount to the government  opening the gates to anarchy : Our country is founded on law; Parliament legislates and the courts apply these. Morgan Johansson s statement and his otherwise passive approach are testimony to how this, our kind of democracy, may fade into a memory very shortly. He now laid the first brick in the building of a state that rests on other principles. Anarchism. If anarchy really does break out, it would be good to remember that there are nearly two million licensed firearms in Sweden. Sweden s shooting clubs have seen a surge in interest; many are welcoming a lot of new members lately. Via: Gatestone Institute",0

"One thing in life you never want to do is pretend you know something about another person s life experiences. You ll never know the moments and quality of life someone had unless you actually hear it from that person themselves. However, now, in a last-ditch effort to appeal to voters, Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson has decided to tell us all about how President Obama grew up. In fact, Carson s gone so far as to allude to the fact that actually he would be the real first black president, because Obama was  raised white,  and that Obama doesn t actually understand what it s like to be black.He told the Politico podcast: He s an  African  American. He was, you know, raised white. Putting an emphasis on  African    however, continuing: I mean, like most Americans, I was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected, but   he didn t grow up like I grew up   Many of his formative years were spent in Indonesia. So, for him to, you know, claim that, you know, he identifies with the experience of black Americans, I think, is a bit of a stretch. Carson also seems to believe that the racism many are experiencing now, such as young unarmed men being gunned down in the street by those paid to protect and serve, as well as every reason Black Lives Matter needs to exist, isn t really racism as compared to what he went through. Carson implies that his life experiences are the ones that should really count as racism and other people, well, they just don t know. He said: Remember now, I ve been around for 64 years, you know. I ve had a chance to see what real racism is. Carson also claims that he doesn t think the Republican Party is racist. I don t find any particular problem being an African-American in the Republican Party. The people I know that in the progressive side of things, they like to say that the Republicans are racist. I know that. I haven t experienced that. So, because he hasn t experienced it. Well, then, it must not exist. Right?It s as though he believes he s the be all and end all in the discussion of racism. Perhaps if he ever took the time to get out of his own egotistical, self-serving mind, he d understand that racism now, is real racism, too. Every experience is valid. Every experience needs to be heard. And to undermine President Obama, and to make the bold claim that he s not really black because he was  raised white  is not only presumptuous and disrespectful, but outright wrong.Listen to the whole podcast here:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248401712  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Featured image: Flickr",0
"Donald Trump s personality could be described several ways. Some would call him type A   competitive, outgoing, ambitious and aggressive   while others would call him the textbook case of narcissistic personality disorder. Megalomaniac is another that comes to mind. No matter what way you look at The Donald, he definitely doesn t qualify as  typical. As it turns out, there may be a very good, very dangerous, very pharmaceutical reason for it. Gawker recently re-examined an article from 1992 that may have more to do with Donald Trump s failures as a human being than the genes he inherited from his booze and hooker pimping grandfather.As it turns out, a story from Spy Magazine revealed that Trump was a patient of the infamous Dr. Joseph Greenburg, who was known for prescribing an amphetamine-like drug called Tenuate Dospan for a non-existent condition called  metabolic imbalance.  According to the story:Dr. Greenberg s program included no set caloric limit, and Tenuate was prescribed or five months. The long-term use of Tenuate can, according to the medical literature, lead to psychosis delusions of grandeur, say, like the belief that by simply putting your name on real estate properties, you will double their value.According to the NIH, prolonged use of tenuate can lead to hallucinations and confusion. Prolonged is exactly what Trump s exposure to the drug can be described as, according to this medical record obtained by Gawker that shows years of visits to Greenburg by Trump:Gawker was able to confirm by email with a former employee of Greenburg that this is in fact an actual copy of The Donald s record. Since Greenburg s role in Trump s care seemed to only include giving him happy pills that should have been prescribed for no longer than a month, it could be argued that the lasting effects of anger, anxiety and delusions of grandeur are still with the man today. His campaign speeches and lack of ability to hold a coherent thought in an interview for more than a moment or two are fairly clear indicators.The pills had such a detrimental effect on Trump that one of his Vice-Presidents once noted that when he got to work he would ask if it was a  Dr, Greenburg day,  doing everything in his power to avoid the boss if the answer was yes.Does Trump s obsession with fitness and physical appearance have something to do with his obvious desire to be thin and trim? His personal attacks on people based solely on their looks do a pretty good job of answering that question.Featured image from Gawker via screen capture ",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Deep divisions cut short Republican hopes for a quick revival of Obamacare replacement legislation on Wednesday, as Congress prepared to leave town for a two-week recess without a deal to end party infighting. “We are going to go home tomorrow without a deal,” Congressman Chris Collins, a Republican moderate in the U.S. House of Representatives, told reporters.   A White House ally, Collins said days of negotiations have broken down over conservative demands to allow states to waive popular Obamacare policies that protect sick people from price discrimination and allow young adults to stay on their parents’ healthcare plans until age 26. He said the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus was “moving the goal posts” for negotiations, risking potential support from moderate Republicans.   Both sides of the debate have warned that the Republican push for healthcare reform, one of President Donald Trump’s top campaign promises, could lose momentum if lawmakers left this week without a deal to bridge fissures that led to the legislation’s failure on March 24, when House Speaker Paul Ryan canceled a vote. Earlier on Wednesday, Heritage Action Chief Executive Mike Needham told reporters his conservative group was looking at ways to target House moderates known as the Tuesday Group, with attack ads in their districts and other tactics. But Ryan told a forum that the discussions had been “very productive” and emphasized that Republican leaders have not set a deadline for agreement. “We can keep working this for weeks now,” Ryan said. “We’ve got time to figure this out.”    Republicans have been railing against President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act since its enactment in 2010. On Tuesday, some Republican lawmakers expressed hope the Trump White House would unveil a healthcare bill. Some conservatives said a vote by the House was possible this week.  The legislation has not yet emerged, despite talks with Republican lawmakers led by Vice President Mike Pence. A House Republican leadership aide said on Wednesday that plans remained on track for the divided chamber to begin a more than two-week recess by mid-afternoon on Thursday. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, late on Tuesday said, “There’s a concern on my part that if we’re making real progress, that going home sends the wrong message.”  Meadows told reporters on Wednesday he had not yet heard from the White House about timing of the next negotiation session. Still, the negotiations will allow lawmakers to return to their home districts and tell voters they are trying to deliver on a campaign promise that helped them win election. In an interview with Axios and NBC television, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Republicans will produce a healthcare bill, but did not provide a timetable. Late on Tuesday, following a closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Pence told reporters there was “good talk, good progress” toward a bill. He did not elaborate. Republican lawmakers have said efforts are focused on maintaining Obamacare’s essential health benefits, such as mental health coverage and maternity care. But states could apply for waivers if they could improve coverage and reduce costs. If major portions of Obamacare are repealed, there were discussions of creating a “backstop” so premiums do not spike for people with chronic illnesses in high-risk insurance pools. ",1

"Congress will vote on a new spending bill in just a few days so they d better get crackin  so they can read the 2,009 page bill before they vote on it, right? You can bet that when the vote comes on this bad deal that most of those voting on it have no idea what s in it. It s a typical pork-filled spending bill that throws the American taxpayer under the bus. The Republicans caved on letting Obama send 10,000 Syrian refugees for the taxpayers to support. Republicans are spineless sellouts The new spending deal reached early Wednesday morning spans more than 2,000 pages, spends $1.149 trillion   and lawmakers will have only a few days to digest it all before they re asked to vote on the legislation, which lays out Congress s priorities for the rest of fiscal year 2016.It works out to nearly $572 million per page, with lawmakers splashing money throughout the government, boosting both popular and unpopular programs alike, thanks to a spending hike agreed to in October s budget deal. That means even the IRS, which the GOP had targeted year after year for cuts, will finally see an increase in 2016. Negotiators agreed to a $290 million boost, though the extra money is required to be spent on taxpayer services and fraud detection. It s still $1.7 billion less than President Obama asked for the tax agency.The biggest fights came on policy disputes, where the GOP won a few of its priorities, but caved on far more. The bill allows Mr. Obama to follow through on his plans to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees in the U.S. this fiscal year, but does give him new powers to require some visitors from Visa Waiver Program countries to face extra scrutiny if they ve been to Iraq or Syria recently. The goal is to try to weed out foreign fighters who may have trained with the Islamic State.Republicans maintained a ban on federal funding of gun control research, turning back an effort by Democratic leaders to force studies in the wake of this year s mass killings.In a slap at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the bill also prohibits the State Department from spending money to maintain private email accounts. Mrs. Clinton exclusively used an email server kept at her home in New York during her time in office, thwarting open-records requests and spawning the scandal that s ensnared her presidential campaign this year.Leaders of both parties will have to round up the votes to pass the measure this week, and both sides are describing it as a compromise that they can t afford to pass up. This package reflects conservative priorities in both funding and policy   including support for critical areas such as our national defense, halting many harmful regulations, and trimming wasteful spending. But it also represents a compromise that members on both sides of the aisle can and should get behind,  said Rep. Hal Rogers, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.The bill was released at 2 a.m. Wednesday morning, meaning that if GOP leaders stick to their three-day pledge it shouldn t be voted on in the House until Friday at the earliest.That would still require reading a page every two minutes, continuously over the next couple of days, in order to get through the bill before the vote.Read more: WT",0
"Our beautiful First Lady Michelle Obama used her final commencement address to take aim at GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, and it was absolutely glorious. Taking to the stage at the City College of New York before the graduates, Mrs. Obama pulled no punches. There was no need to mention Trump by name, as there could be no doubt as to whom she was talking about. She began: Here in America, we don t give into our fears. We don t build up walls to keep people out, because we know that our greatness has always depended on contributions from people who were born elsewhere but sought out this country and made it their home. After that, Mrs. Obama continued to take aim at him: Some folks out there today seem to have a very different perspective. They seem to view our diversity as a threat to be contained rather than as a resource to be tapped. They tell us to be afraid of those who are different, to be suspicious of those with whom we disagree.They act as if name-calling is an acceptable substitute for thoughtful debate, as if anger and intolerance should be our default state, rather than the optimism and openness that have always been the engine of our progress.I have seen what happens when ideas like these take hold. I have seen how leaders who rule by intimidation, leaders who demonize and dehumanize entire groups of people, often do so because they have nothing else to offer. That is not who we are. It seems that no one, even our First Lady, can resist slamming Trump. Michelle Obama has largely been quiet on the 2016 race. She has endorsed no one, and she has slammed no one   until now. That really says something about how out of control Trump is, that she felt compelled to do so. This speech also makes a huge impact with its timing, because everyone is still talking about Thursday s brilliantly fiery speech from Hillary Clinton, in which the Democratic frontrunner laid into Trump like no one has ever done before.Of course, Mrs. Obama could not, as a sitting First Lady rather than a political candidate, use a commencement speech to go after Trump by name in the brutal fashion that Secretary Clinton did. However, that doesn t matter. Her message was loud, clear, and true: Trump s ideas are dangerous, and they have no place in America at all, much less in the White House.Watch a few clips of this incredible speech below, via The Hill: Featured image via video screen capture",0
"(Reuters) - Myanmar stands accused by rights groups of ethnic cleansing and human rights violations after violence broke out in the northwestern state of Rakhine, triggering an exodus of about 400,000 Rohingya Muslims to southern Bangladesh.  At least 400 people have been killed, and thousands of homes and villages have been torched, since the military launched a counteroffensive against Rohingya insurgents in late August. Myanmar does not recognize the roughly 1.1 million Rohingyas as citizens, leaving them effectively stateless. The following are questions and answers on the violence:     The military says it is protecting Myanmar against attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which it has labeled a terrorist group and accuses of killings and destruction in Rakhine state.  Human rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Rohingya. Rights groups say an independent investigation is required to determine possible abuses or violations by various parties.     Yes, according to United Nations officials and rights groups.   Top U.N. officials have said the violence in Myanmar is a case of  textbook ethnic cleansing .   The U.N. has in the past defined ethnic cleansing as  rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area.        Ethnic cleansing is not recognized as a separate crime under international law. But allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts against individuals - including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted of genocide. Phil Robertson, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said initial investigations in Myanmar were  indicative of an ethnic cleansing campaign .  When an army is burning people out of their villages all over northern Rakhine state and using violence against civilians, it results in the kind of incredible refugee flows we re seeing,  he added. Myanmar has denied allegations of ethnic cleansing. ARE WE SEEING GENOCIDE, WAR CRIMES, CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY? Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing of hundreds of Rohingya amounted to genocide, but rights groups have so far stayed away from these labels, because all three categories are clearly defined and covered in international law. For the ongoing violence to be considered war crimes, the parties involved would have to be at war. Currently, experts say, Myanmar is not technically at war because it only has one party - the military - that is organized enough to carry out intensive fighting operations.     We have not yet been able to determine whether a  state of war  is present in Rakhine state,  said HRW s Robertson.   Crimes against humanity and genocide could be taking place even in the absence of war, but, under U.N. definitions, there would need to be proof of other conditions such as broader,  systematic attacks against the Rohingyas.         Human rights groups have accused Myanmar of laying anti-personnel mines along the border with Bangladesh to prevent Rohingya refugees from returning to Rakhine state.  Because the crisis is not currently defined as a war, this cannot be considered a war crime, according to experts.  However it would violate other international human rights laws, even though Myanmar is not party to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty.   For nations that are not parties to the treaty, the use of anti-personnel mines violates customary international law, because the weapons are inherently indiscriminate and cause disproportionate long-term harm to civilians,  said Richard Weir, a legal expert at HRW.  A Myanmar military source told Reuters that landmines were laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them, but that none had been planted recently. In international law, an individual can be held criminally responsible for when a state or military commits war crimes or crimes against humanity. Rights groups have called for an independent investigation of abuses by all parties, including ARSA. Many believe the government and the military should be held responsible.   Myanmar is systematically violating the rights of the Rohingya ... and both the government and the military now need to suffer serious consequences for this,  said HRW s Robertson. This depends on the findings of an independent investigation, if the Myanmar government allows one to take place, experts say. Rights groups have called for the U.N. Security Council to also reprimand Myanmar in other ways, for instance, by imposing sanctions such as an arms embargo. They have also urged countries, including the United States and Australia, to suspend bilateral military ties. The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has faced widespread international criticism for not doing enough to protect the Rohingya community. Suu Kyi has no direct control over the military, which remains powerful under Myanmar s army-written constitution. But she is Myanmar s foreign minister and de facto civilian leader and has defended the military operation.  It s premature to speculate,  said Robertson, adding that individual responsibility should be based on an impartial investigation.  The International Criminal Court (ICC), based in The Hague, Netherlands, has the jurisdiction to prosecute crimes of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  Myanmar is among the countries, which also include the United States and China, that are not signatory to the treaty that created the ICC, so it is not obligated to cooperate. But if the U.N. Security Council were to refer a case to the court then Myanmar, being a member of the U.N., would be subject to its jurisdiction. Ad hoc tribunals and commissions have been set up in the past to hear cases of mass human rights violations. For instance, the United Nations established the International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda to deal with crimes that took place there. Rights groups say they are protected by various U.N. human rights treaties, primarily the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Myanmar voted for in 1948. The document includes provisions for the right to life and right to a nationality - particularly relevant to the Rohingyas, who are effectively stateless. (Story amends headline.) ",1

"(Reuters) - A former Vietnamese official who Germany says was kidnapped in Berlin to face charges in Hanoi over financial losses at a state construction firm had been cleared of wrongdoing by the previous government, according to documents seen by Reuters. The decision to re-open the case and aggressively pursue prosecution shows the tougher stance taken by the ruling Communist Party since Vietnam s security establishment emerged stronger from a power struggle last year in which ex-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung lost out.  The party says it wants to tackle corruption but some critics have accused Vietnam s rulers of embarking on a witch-hunt following the launch of investigations implicating increasingly senior figures. The internal crackdown drew global attention last month when Germany accused Hanoi of kidnapping Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former official with state oil firm PetroVietnam. He was accused of financial mismanagement that caused losses of $150 million at PetroVietnam Construction (PVC) during the time he served as chairman from 2009 to 2013. But according to a letter dated May 18, 2015 from then trade minister Vu Huy Hoang to then Prime Minister Dung, the official had stated his responsibility but the government had not  found negative signs  relating to his actions.  Therefore, authorized agencies and units agreed not to take disciplinary action over Thanh,  it said, noting that he had moved to a role at the trade ministry, where he had worked hard to try to resolve the problems at PetroVietnam Construction.  Corrective work and post-inspection handling of PVC were done effectively and in accordance with the prime minister s requirements,  the letter said. Responding to questions about the letter and whether there would be further prosecutions over the case, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said the party and state were resolute in dealing with corruption or lawbreaking by any organization or individual.  Based on the results of the investigation, the functional agencies shall strictly handle those who violate the law in accordance with the provisions of Vietnamese law,  she told Reuters. Reuters was unable to contact Thanh, former trade minister Hoang or former prime minister Dung either directly or through government offices. Thanh ran PetroVietnam Construction, a subsidiary of a sprawling state enterprise that is also involved in everything from oil and gas to power generation, ship building and insurance. After his return to Vietnam, Thanh was shown on state television saying that he had decided to surrender himself in order to face justice. The government has not said how he returned home. Thanh was a relatively junior figure among those who are under investigation in relation to PetroVietnam s dealings as well as in the banking sector. The most senior political casualty so far is Dinh La Thang, a former PetroVietnam chairman who was sacked from his role in the politburo. A vice-minister who had been responsible for appointing Thanh has also been sacked. Hoang has also been symbolically stripped of his title of former trade minister for violating state and party rules. Investigations continue into PetroVietnam and the trade ministry which oversaw it as well as into the central bank. There are widespread expectations that more members of Dung s administration will be prosecuted. Dung lost out last year in the battle to secure the post of Communist Party General Secretary, Vietnam s most powerful position. The post remained in the hands of Nguyen Phu Trong, whose modest public profile contrasts with the conspicuous wealth that some members of Dung s administration displayed.  Fighting and preventing corruption, waste and negativity are no longer handled slowly and case by case. It has become a movement,  Trong said in July. According to a survey by Transparency International conducted between July 2015 and January 2017, Vietnam had become the most bribery prone country in Asia after India and a majority of Vietnamese believed corruption had worsened.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior German politicians on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of trivializing violence by white supremacists in Virginia and called for a clear rejection of their ideology. Governments could only win the fight against hatred, racism and anti-Semitism by rejecting such ideology and the willingness to use violence, said Martin Schulz, the center-left candidate for chancellor, adding that this applies to Germany and the United States. “The trivialization of Nazi violence by the confused utterances of Donald Trump is highly dangerous,” said Schulz, leader of the Social Democrats (SPD). “We should not tolerate the monstrosities coming out of the president’s mouth,” he told the RND newspaper group in an interview. Republican leaders criticized Trump for saying leftist counter-protesters were also to blame for violence last Saturday in Charlottesville that left one person dead and several injured. His comments won praise from white far-right groups. Schulz is the main challenger to Chancellor Angela Merkel at a Sept. 24 election. The SPD, junior partner in Merkel’s grand coalition, trails Merkel’s conservatives in polls. Schulz’s comments were echoed by Justice Minister Heiko Maas, another senior member of the SPD. “It is unbearable how Trump is now glossing over the violence of the right-wing hordes from Charlottesville,” Maas said in a statement, reflecting concern across the German political spectrum about the Trump presidency. “No one should trivialize anti-Semitism and racism by neo-Nazis,” said Maas, senior member of the co-governing SPD. Schulz and Maas are the highest-ranking German politicians to criticize Trump’s rhetoric about the violence. The country has tough laws against hate speech and any symbols linked to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, who ruled from 1933 until their defeat in 1945.  Merkel told broadcaster Phoenix on Monday that clear and forceful action was required to combat right-wing extremism, noting that Germans had also seen a rise in anti-Semitism and had “quite a lot to do at home ourselves”. Trump has come under increasing pressure over his stance on the violence, with many members of his own Republican party and U.S. business executives distancing themselves from him. Trump on Tuesday said his original reaction was based on facts he had at the time and said both sides were to blame. The violence erupted during a protest by white nationalists against plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army during the American Civil War. Protesters and counter-protesters clashed in scattered street brawls before a car ploughed into the rally’s opponents, killing one woman and injuring 19 other people. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team has questioned Sam Clovis, co-chairman of President Donald Trump’s election campaign, to  determine if Trump or top aides knew of the extent of the campaign team’s contacts with Russia, two sources familiar with the investigation said on Friday. The focus of the questions put to Clovis by Mueller’s team has not been previously reported. “The ultimate question Mueller is after is whether candidate Trump and then President-elect Trump knew of the discussions going on with Russia, and who approved or even directed them,” said one source. “That is still just a question.”   Clovis testified in late October before the grand jury in Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He is also cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the same issues. Contacted late on Friday, the White House declined to comment. One of the sources described Clovis as “another domino” after former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over his own contacts with Russians during the 2016 election campaign.  “The investigators now know what Papadopoulos was doing on the Russian front, which he initially tried to conceal, and who he told that to,” said the other source. “Now [they] want to know whether Clovis and others reported these activities and others related to Russia, and if so, to whom,” this source said.  Attorneys for Clovis did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Papadopoulos had no immediate comment. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment. According to court documents related to Papadopoulos’ guilty plea, he reported to Clovis in an email on a March 24, 2016, meeting he had in London with a professor later identified as Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud in turn introduced him to a Russian woman and the Russian ambassador in London, and they discussed setting up meetings to talk about U.S.-Russia ties in a Trump presidency. The documents showed Clovis responded to the proposed meetings by saying he would “work it through the campaign.” While he told Papadopoulos not to make a commitment then to set up those meetings, he congratulated him for “great work.” In August 2016, after Trump won the Republican presidential nomination, Clovis encouraged Papadopoulos to “make the trip” when Papadopoulos proposed going to an off-the-record meeting with unnamed Russian officials, the court documents show. Victoria Toensing, one of Clovis’s lawyers, said last week her client “always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaign”. After Papadopoulos’ guilty plea, the White House and former Trump campaign officials dismissed Papadopoulos and Clovis as minor figures in the campaign.  The campaign’s National Security Advisory Committee, which Clovis formed, has become a focus of the investigations by both Mueller and the Senate, sources said. “Sam built the first group of eight,” J.D. Gordon, the director of the campaign foreign policy group, told Reuters, adding that he and then-Senator Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. Attorney General, had “nearly doubled” it in size. However, two other sources familiar with the investigations said investigators have been told the committee Clovis formed did very little, and that other advisers appeared to carry more weight with Trump.

"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s Supreme Court ruling to scrap last month s presidential election was shaped by a new chief justice who proved a staunch defender of judicial independence on a continent where judges are often seen as being under the thumb of executive powers. David Maraga s declaration that the Aug. 8 election was void and demand for a new poll with 60 days shocked many in the East African nation and abroad. But his announcement, after a 4-2 vote by a court panel to annul the vote, didn t surprise those who know the chief justice.  We knew this case was coming and he was the man to hear it,  Professor Tom Ojienda, who worked with Maraga and sits on the Judicial Service Commission that appointed him chief justice, told Reuters.  He is a stickler for the rules.  President Uhuru Kenyatta, who was expected to be sworn in for a second term until Friday s Supreme Court ruling, said he respected the decision. But he took a swipe at Maraga s colleagues, calling them  crooks  and saying the judiciary needed fixing. Kenya, a U.S. ally in the fight against Islamists and a trade gateway to East Africa, has a history of disputed votes. A  row after the 2007 vote led to ethnic bloodshed that killed more than 1,200 people. In 2013, a bid by veteran opponent Raila Odinga to secure an election rerun was rejected by the Supreme Court. This time, the opposition changed tack in their petition. Instead of seeking to prove enough votes were fake to undermine the vote - an almost impossible task in the two weeks the court had to give its judgment - Odinga s supporters sought to demonstrate that the online tallying process lacked integrity. The new approach may have been a key factor in securing a decision that had the backing of four of the panel s six judges, who have three weeks from the ruling to publish details of their decision. But the opposition also found in the chief justice a man ready to defend judicial powers against the highest office and unswayed by a tendency in Kenya, a nation of more than 40 ethnic groups, for voters to back fellow clans people. Within months of his appointment in October, Maraga called out Kenyatta for telling voters on a campaign stop in Maraga s home region of Nyamira County in April that  their son  had a job. Maraga responded that his appointment had nothing to do with the president. Kenyatta is a Kikuyu, Kenya s biggest ethnic group but still a minority. Odinga is a Luo, another big grouping. The chief justice is Kisii, a smaller group from Kenya s western highlands. Maraga also sent a clear message to national leaders on Aug. 2 that the judiciary was above the political fray.  The emerging culture of public lynching of judges and judicial officers by the political class is a vile affront to the rule of law and must be fiercely resisted,  he said in a statement. Maraga did not immediately issue a response to Kenyatta s latest comments. Reuters could not reach him for comment. Kenyans have long complained that getting any official business done requires a  kitu kidogo , Swahili for  a little something  or bribe, a frustration that is echoed across Africa. But Kenya has slowly rebuilt confidence in its judiciary after the post-2007 vote violence. A new constitution in 2010 demanded reforms of the judiciary and other public institutions. Maraga, who has risen the ranks as those reforms have been implement, was known by colleagues for his strict adherence to the rules even as a young lawyer. A devout Christian of the Seventh Day Adventist tradition, he built his practice in the Rift Valley city of Nakuru rather than to Nairobi where he where he could have secured more high profile cases and would have more easily rubbed shoulders with the rich and powerful, his colleagues said.  If a client gave you any problem, or asked for anything  that was wrong, or refused to pay, (Maraga) would just say,  Let him go. Other ones will come ,  said Professor Ojienda said. Maraga s integrity and record of strictly interpreting election procedures in past polls swayed the commission to appoint him last October, Ojienda said. The opposition s high hopes in 2013 that it could overturn that election result were dashed. Supreme Court judges, then led by Maraga s predecessor Willy Mutunga, rejected their petition. This time, even Odinga - a former prime minister who has fought and lost three presidential races including this one - seemed surprised. After listening to Friday s ruling in court, he broke out into a broad grin and pumped his fist in the air. Since 2013, several new judges were appointed to the Supreme Court s seven-strong panel. Friday s decision was backed by Maraga and two others appointed after 2013. Another, who had been on the panel in 2013, also backed the ruling. Two judges dissented, while one was ill and did not vote.  An election is not an event, it is a process from the beginning to the end,  Maraga said before reading the ruling. Four years earlier, the opposition had some of their arguments thrown out as they were lodged too late, while their complaints about the widespread failure of the electronic voting systems failed to convince the judges. This time, the opposition case hinged on the election board s failure to post online tally forms from each of the 40,883 polling stations before announcing results. The forms were supposed to be signed by each party s agent, as a hard-copy backup to the electronic transmission. But thousands of forms were missing from the board s website when it announced results. A report by independent court-appointed experts found many forms lacked official stamps, signatures or serial numbers. That was enough to convince a majority in Maraga s panel.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian warplanes took off from an air base which was hit by U.S. cruise missiles on Friday, and carried out air strikes on rebel-held areas in the eastern Homs countryside, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The U.S. Navy had fired dozens of missiles at the air base near Homs city in response to a chemical attack this week which Washington and its allies blamed on the Damascus government. The British-based Observatory, a group monitoring the Syrian war using sources on the ground, said eight people had been killed in the U.S. attack. The extent of the damage to the Shayrat air base was not entirely clear, but the Syrian warplanes had “done the impossible” in order to continue using it for sorties, the Observatory told Reuters.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a  crushing  response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group. The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.  He is expected on Oct. 15 to  decertify  a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Trump is also expected to designate Iran s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.   We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.  If they do, Iran s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,  he told a news conference reported by IRNA. Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not. IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday,  If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.  Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC s missiles. U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS). France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region. Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.  A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy. The U.N. nuclear watchdog s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.  Trump called Iran  a corrupt dictatorship  during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was  the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into . The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it. The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have  negative consequences.   British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be  clear-eyed  about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.  They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran s destabilizing regional activity,  May s spokesman said. Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism. Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.  The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its  malign activities  across the Middle East. The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the  Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act  which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea. In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of  funding North Korea  and  doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate . Qasemi, Iran s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were  baseless . He added,  Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.   ",1

"It s not news to say that Donald Trump is a phony. He s neither a great businessman nor as wealthy as he says he is. He contradicts his own words far more often than he contradicts the words of his opponent.So, who is the real Donald Trump, and does he believe a single word of what he says? Well, we can t know that for sure, but what we do know is that in 2008, Trump was a Hillary Clinton supporter. In fact, he called her  fantastic  in a Fox News (yes, Fox News) interview. Now, to be fair, he also said he was a fan of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. He also, despite not knowing much about him, called Barack Obama  very capable. Even eight years ago, Trump was asked whether he would ever run for president. He said he would probably never run because -you read this right   he s  too honest. Here s the video:That s wasn t the first or the last time Trump praised the woman who s standing in his way of becoming Dictator in Chief. Last month, Clinton put out an ad showing Trump heaping her with praise.The ad features the words,  Donald Trump reveals the truth about Hillary Clinton  and shows Trump saying on FOX News,  Hillary Clinton, I think, is a terrific woman.  In another clip, Trump praises her and Bill Clinton, saying,  I know her very well and I know her husband very well, and I like them both They are just really terrific people. The ad also quotes Trump praising Hillary Clinton as a  smart, tough and a very nice person,  and said,  She really works hard, and I think she does a good job. Source: TimeDoes it really matter what Trump said about Hillary Clinton in the past? He can t even keep his story straight about what he said yesterday. The damage here is not that he s contradicting himself. His supporters really don t care about that. The damage here is that Trump s supporters hate Hillary Clinton even more than they like Trump. If we could somehow play this on a nonstop loop at Walmart or wherever Trump supporters congregate, we might see a rash of exploding heads.Featured image via video screen capture. ",0
"It shouldn t be surprising to anyone that Trump is attacking recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. However, many people assume that he s doing so because he s afraid of the recounts proving he didn t actually win the election. That s only partly true. Evan McMullin, who ran for President as an independent, has a different hypothesis that s much worse than such a fear:It should not go unrecognized that @realDonaldTrump s effort to inflate his election performance without cause is typical of autocrats. https://t.co/rY4e5jmWxZ  Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) November 27, 2016They do it increase the perception of their political legitimacy, while undermining popular opposition to them.  Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) November 27, 2016Whoa. Interesting idea, and it does fit with what we know of Trump s personality. So it s not a stretch to believe that fear of losing face, and anger at having his legitimacy questioned at all, is at the root of Trump s attacks. It s not just the possibility that he could be proven a loser here.But there s something even more insidious than showing Trump has autocratic tendencies. We already know he has strong autocratic tendencies. But he also undermined our democracy by repeatedly calling the election rigged. His attempts to undermine opposition in this manner expands his attack on democracy. McMullin points out that both of these tactics help to solidify an autocrat s power:And, in the process, they do enormous damage to democratic institutions, which is a larger objective they share.  Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) November 27, 2016Because it is those institutions and supporting norms that present the most significant check on an authoritarian s power.  Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) November 27, 2016When confidence in those institutions and norms has been sufficiently eroded, the authoritarian has a freer hand with which to wield power.  Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) November 27, 2016Trump s claims during his campaign that only he could fix our country, and fuck using our democratic system to try and do it because it s all rigged anyway, demonstrated his dictatorial nature. By throwing Twitter tantrums over possible recounts, and claiming there was massive voter fraud even though he won, Trump is trying to put us all in our places while reinforcing his image as a strong political leader who is beloved by everyone.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",0
"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces have taken control of areas previously held by Kurdish forces in Mosul s Nineveh province in northern Iraq, a military statement said on Wednesday. The areas were evacuated by Kurdish Peshmerga fighters before the arrival of the Iraqi forces on Tuesday, the statement said. The Peshmerga had taken them over the past three years as part of the war against Islamic State militants. The Mosul Dam, northwest of the city, is among the positions retaken from the Peshmerga, the military statement said.   Responding to a Kurdish referendum on independence held last month, Iraqi government forces backed by Iranian-trained paramilitary groups captured the Kurdish-held oil region of Kirkuk on Monday, transforming the country s balance of power. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered the retaking of Kirkuk on Monday, as well as all disputed areas claimed by both the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government and the central authorities in Baghdad.

"KIEV (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on a visit to Ukraine on Thursday said Washington would keep up pressure on Russia over what he called its aggressive behavior and signaled his personal support for providing weapons to Kiev. Mattis said Russia had not abided by the Minsk ceasefire agreement meant to end the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and that the United States would maintain sanctions on Moscow.    Despite Russia s denials, we know they are seeking to redraw international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free nations of Europe,  Mattis told reporters, alongside Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Mattis s visit, timed for Ukrainian Independence Day, is the second high-profile show of U.S. support in as many months, after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson came to Kiev in July.    Ukraine has counted on U.S. support against Russia since a pro-Western government took power following street protests in 2014 when the Kremlin-backed president fled the country. But some of President Donald Trump s comments during the election campaign last year, such as appearing to recognize Crimea as part of Russia, stoked fears in Kiev that Trump might mend ties with Moscow at Ukraine s expense. While emphasizing Trump had yet to take a decision on the issue, Mattis signaled his personal support for a longstanding Ukrainian request for defensive weapons, which could include anti-tank Javelin missiles and anti-aircaft systems. Mattis also played down fears, voiced by the previous White House administration under Barack Obama, that supplying weapons could escalate the situation.   On the defensive lethal weapons, we are actively reviewing it, I will go back now having seen the current situation and be able to inform the secretary of state and the president in very specific terms what I recommend for the direction ahead,  Mattis said.  Defensive weapons are not provocative unless you are an aggressor and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor since it is their own territory where the fighting is happening,  Mattis said. Poroshenko said he was  satisfied  with the progress on discussions about weapons, and also said he and Mattis had discussed the possibility of a U.N.-backed armed force being sent to eastern Ukraine. Relations between Ukraine and Russia went into freefall after Moscow s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people. Russia denies sending troops and weapons to eastern Ukraine.  According to U.S. officials, a plan to provide defensive weapons to Ukraine has made its way to the White House but has not been signed. Thus far the Pentagon says it has provided $750 million in non-lethal aid to Ukraine since 2015, which includes radars and uniforms. Supplying weapons  will be a huge boost of support to Ukraine,  said Michael Carpenter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the region. Carpenter said the weapons under discussion cannot effectively be used to take territory, which means providing them would help stabilize the situation. U.S. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, also pressed the Trump administration to act.   Secretary Mattis  visit to Kiev provides yet another opportunity for the United States to correct its policy toward Ukraine and provide the lethal defensive assistance the country needs to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,  McCain said in a statement on Wednesday.  Mattis  strong words against Moscow on Thursday are likely to reassure eastern European allies who are concerned about Russia s military activity in region, including planned war games in September. Russia and Belarus aim to hold joint exercises that some North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies believe could number more than 100,000 troops and involve nuclear weapons training, the biggest such exercise since 2013. Earlier this year, Estonia s defense minister said Russia may use the exercises to move thousands of troops permanently into Belarus in a warning to NATO. Russia has dismissed Western worries about the war games as  buffoonery . ",1
"In an obvious scheme to keep the Supreme Court slanted their way, a conservative lawyer in Arizona claims that Scalia can and should be allowed to vote from beyond the grave.When Justice Antonin Scalia died just over a week ago, he left behind some major cases that could have been ruled 5-4 in favor of conservatives, including an anti-abortion case, an Affordable Healthcare Act contraception case, a case involving public sector unions, a case on voting rights, and a case on affirmative action just to name a few.Conservatives were foaming at the mouth in anticipation of winning most, if not all, of these cases. So it s understandable that they were disappointed when Scalia passed away before decisions could be made on these cases.But one conservative attorney in Arizona is throwing a desperation Hail Mary in an effort to make sure conservatives continue to control the Supreme Court 5-4 even though the composition of the high court is now 4-4.During a KPNX panel on the status of the Court, Kory Langhofer claimed that Justice Scalia should be allowed to cast a vote even though he is dead. There s no Ouija board required to figure out how Justice Scalia would vote on these things, he s already voted,  Langhofer claimed on Sunday. He explained that all of the Justices meet and discuss the case before one Justice goes off to write the decision. And that is why Langhofer thinks Scalia can still vote on these cases.  We re at the second-to-last step in how these cases unfold when Justice Scalia died,  he said.  We know exactly what he thought. And it s not unprincipled to say we should give affect to that. Langhofer then used an example of a US Senator dying after the Senate sends a freshly passed bill to the President after the Vice-President casts the tie-breaking vote.The problem with comparing Congress to the Supreme Court is that the senator had already cast their final vote on the bill, whereas Justice Scalia might have changed his mind anytime between discussion and writing an opinion. And that s how attorney Thomas Ryan explained it to Langhofer. Justices, after they do the conferences can also change their minds,  he pointed out.  The general rule is dead justices don t vote. I mean, that sounds cruel, but that s it. Here s the video via YouTube:But Langhofer continued to argue that Justice Scalia s conservative ideology should be used to decide cases with his opinion even after his death.Of course, if that s the case, why not continue to use long-dead Chief Justice Roger B. Taney s notes to let him vote on cases today? I m sure the author of the Dred Scott decision in 1857 would love to be able to cast votes in cases involving civil rights. After all, we know how he would vote on these things. Or how about we let former Justice Harry Blackmun, who died in 1999, vote on any upcoming abortion cases? After all, we know how he would vote on these things considering he authored the Roe v. Wade decision.112 Americans have sat on the Court. 11 of them still live, but only 8 are still active Justices. So it would be a pain in the ass to access how each of the 101 dead Justices would vote on a Supreme Court case in the present day. Only a living Justice can make a decision, and none of the cases Scalia was discussing reached a final decision because no decision is final until it is announced. Justices can and have changed their minds before at the last minute and there is no way of knowing what Scalia would have done had he still been alive, even with notes kept by the Chief Justice. And that s why dead Justices do not get a vote on the Supreme Court.This is nothing more than a ploy that conservatives are toying with to keep Scalia on the high court for the next year while Republicans block President Obama from nominating a living person to fill the empty seat. It s a dangerous slope that threatens our Constitution, which, by the way, says nothing about letting a dead judge continue to issue rulings until a new judge replaces them.The bottom line is that Scalia is dead, and while that is tragic for his friends and family, the Supreme Court must move on and that means a new Justice must takeover whether conservatives like it or not.Featured Image: Flickr",0
"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish leader and ex-Iraqi president Jalal Talabani died on Tuesday at age 83, Iraqi state TV said, a week after Iraq s autonomous Kurdish region held a referendum on independence. Talabani, a veteran leader of the Kurdish struggle for self-determination, stepped down as president in 2014, after a long period of treatment following a stroke in 2012. Talabani died in Germany, according to Erbil-based Rudaw TV,  which reported earlier in the day that his health had deteriorated. He often went to Germany for medical treatment. His wife and companion in political struggle, Hero, and his Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party voiced only lukewarm support for the Sept. 25 referendum that delivered an overwhelming  yes  to secession from Iraq. Unlike Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) leader Massoud Barzani of the rival Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), the PUK has had traditionally good ties with Iran and Iranian-backed Shi ite groups which are effectively ruling in Baghdad. The Baghdad government, Iran and Turkey all strongly opposed the referendum.   Talabani was born near Erbil, now the seat of the autonomous KRG in northern Iraq, in 1933. He lived in Sulaimaniya, a stronghold of his PUK, the main rival of Barzani s KDP.   He was the first non-Arab president of Iraq, elected in 2005, two years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Arab. Fuad Masoum, a Kurd from the PUK, replaced Talabani in the Iraqi presidency, a largely ceremonial post in the political system established after Saddam s overthrow that concentrates power in the hand of the prime minister, now Haider al-Abadi, an Arab Shi ite Muslim.    One of Talabani s sons, Qubad, is the current deputy prime minister of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq. ",1
"Buckle up. Elizabeth Warren, continuing her crusade for the little guy, wrote a letter to FBI director James Comey over their transparency with Hillary s emails, because they didn t have that same transparency when investigating the big banks. In fact, they usually don t release anything when there s no indictment. They changed their standards for releasing information with Hillary, and Warren wants to know why that same standard can t be used on Wall Street executives. Your recent actions with regard to the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provide a clear precedent for releasing additional information about the investigation of the parties responsible for the financial crisis These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals. If Secretary Clinton s email server was of sufficient  interest  to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency. She s more than right; if Hillary s emails are of sufficient interest to release as much information as possible, then why isn t the information on those who have been proven to cause harm to millions of Americans by crashing the economy of the same interest? It should actually be of bigger interest than the witch hunt against Hillary.The FBI initially released information in response to several FOIA requests from the press, and sent more material to Congress. However, they didn t send over every last, little, tiny bit. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), incensed that they d spurn him like that, subpoenaed the full file earlier this week.Republicans all over Congress are pitching a hell of a tantrum over the FBI not releasing every last scrap of paper, but they really couldn t care less that the FBI didn t release anything after the Department of Justice decided not to prosecute eleven bankers that had a hand in destroying the economy. Why?Simple. When it s Hillary Clinton, everything has to be changed. She must be guilty of something; Republicans and Hillary-haters know things. When it s people who actually harmed America, though? Meh. Not that important why nobody was prosecuted. Here s hoping that Warren s letter has an impact on Comey, because we deserve to know exactly why bankers weren t prosecuted.Featured image by Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",0

Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, said lawmakers should bring Muslim-Americans to the Jan. 12 speech as a way to rebut anti-Muslim rhetoric. Over the past few weeks we have seen a shocking and alarming rise in hateful rhetoric against one particular minority population in our nation,  the pair wrote in an email obtained by POLITICO.  Leading political figures have made offensive and outrageous suggestions that we should create a national registry of all people of one particular faith and that we should prevent any person of that faith from even entering this great country. Donald Trump, the Republican front runner for the presidential nomination, said earlier this month that Muslims should be barred from entering the U.S. because of security concerns. The comments have been widely criticized by politicians across the political spectrum.Via: Politico",0

" The nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors.  -Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali KhameneiSo many lies Is it finally time for the US to act before it s too late?Iran s president on Thursday said Tehran will not sign a final nuclear deal unless world powers lift economic sanctions imposed on the country immediately.The United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany   the so-called P5 +1 group   reached an understanding with Iran last week on limits to its nuclear program in return for lifting crippling economic sanctions, after extended talks in Lausanne, Switzerland.The U.S. has previously said the sanctions would be lifted in phases, but the details have not yet been negotiated.However, in a televised speech on Thursday, President Hassan Rouhani appeared to rule out a gradual removal of the successive round of sanctions that have hit hard its energy and financial sectors   and crippled its economy. We will not sign any deal unless all sanctions are lifted on the same day,  Rouhani said, according to Reuters.  We want a win-win deal for all parties involved in the nuclear talks. Rouhani was speaking at a ceremony to mark Iran s nuclear technology day. The Iranian nation has been and will be the victor in the negotiations,  he said.The deal negotiated in Switzerland says that sanctions will be suspended after international monitors verify that Iran is abiding by the limitations set out, and that the sanctions will resume if Iran fails to fulfill its obligations. It has never been our position that all of the sanctions against Iran should be removed from Day One,  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday.Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday said there is no guarantee a full agreement will be reached by the end of June, the AFP news agency reported. What has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement, nor its contents, nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end,  he said, according to the agency. Everything is in the detail, it may be that the other side (the six world powers), which is unfair, wants to limit our country in the details,  he added.  Officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding. I am neither for nor against. The nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors. Negotiators have until June 30 to fill in the critical details to assure Iran it will get relief from the sanctions as soon as possible, and guarantee the world powers that Iran won t develop a nuclear weapon.Rouhani on Thursday also called for an end to airstrikes by a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, and said they were a  mistake. Not singling out any country in particular, he said,  You learned that it was wrong. You will learn, not later but soon, that you are making mistake in Yemen, too,  the Associated Press reported.(Wouldn t that be considered a threat?)Rouhani also called for a cease-fire in Yemen to enable talks to end the crisis, the AP said, adding to calls by the Red Cross and Russia for a cease-fire to allow aid into the war-torn nation.On Wednesday, the Pentagon said the U.S. military has begun air-refueling operations for the coalition conducting the airstrikes, as Shiite rebels known as Houthis continued their advance on the southern port city of Aden.The Pentagon also said the United States would expedite delivery of ammunition including bombs and guidance systems to the Saudis and other coalition members.Via: USA Today",0
"Are these protesters at the Trump rally in Fresno, CA illegal aliens? If they re not illegal aliens, why are the people who are most angry about the potential of a Trump presidency so loyal to the Mexican flag?Secret Service agents directing the motorcade carrying presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump apparently took evasive action after objects were thrown at the SUV carrying Trump as he departed the Selland Arena in Fresno, California on Friday.

How is the Secret Service supposed to determine if the flying objects being lobbed at the motorcade are Starbucks cups from the anti-capitalists punk protestors molotov cocktails? Here is the video footage of Trump s motorcade barreling through the police barricade:It appears there was a security failure by allowing a horde of anti-Trump protesters with a history of violence across the state and nation to gather en masse within feet of Trump s departing motorcade at a vulnerable point as it crept out of the service entrance for the arena and had to make a hard turn off a driveway exit ramp. The apparent high-speed detour through the police line moments later seems to have been a corrective action.Via: Gateway Pundit",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump intends to nominate Michael Griffin, a former administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, the White House said on Monday. The White House had said in October that Trump intended to tap Griffin for principal deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics. Monday’s announcement did not give a reason for the change. Griffin most recently served as chairman and chief executive officer of the Schafer Corporation, a provider of scientific, engineering, and technical services and products in the national security sector, the White House said. He held the top NASA job from 2005 to 2009. ",1
"Madonna has never been shy about expressing the fact that she hates President-elect Donald Trump with a burning passion. Not only was she a major supporter of Hillary Clinton, but after Trump was elected she was noting saying that she was  ashamed to be an American  (who could blame her?) and that America was  f*cked .And she s far from done speaking about Trump. In a recent interview with Harper s BAZAAR, Madonna got real about how everyday life has been since the Electoral College allowed a completely undeserving bigot to lead this country for the next four years. Opening up about a feeling that many of us are now all too familiar with, Madonna said that every day she s woken up and it s felt like when you break up with somebody who has really broken your heart. Many Americans have been equally heartbroken and disappointed about the election results, and are frightened about the future of the country. She said: It s like being dumped by a lover and also being stuck in a nightmare. Reflecting on the night Trump was elected, Madonna said she was doing what most Americans were: I was sitting at a table with my agent, who is also one of my very best friends, and we were truly praying. We were praying We were doing everything: lighting candles, meditating, praying, offering our lives to God forever, if only. Despite the collective despair that many Americans are feeling right now, Madonna says that she   and every other American that rejected Trump   can t quietly accept defeat. Putting herself and fellow celebrities on blast, Madonna urged anyone with a platform to speak out. She said: I have to get way more vocal and become a little bit less mysterious. What I find really astonishing is how quiet everybody is in my industry. She revealed that while many celebrities are disgusted by Trump, they are afraid to get involved because they still want to  maintain their popularity  and  because it doesn t affect their daily life yet, no one s doing anything about it. If Trump s disastrous, bigotry-filled transition and upcoming administration is any indicator, our lives will be affected before we know it. Now is not the time to be silent.TwitterTwitterFeatured image via Stephen Lovekin and Drew Angerer / Getty Images",0
"ST. LOUIS (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials have started to push back on the idea that the Trump administration’s tax cut plan would boost the economy, cautioning it could instead trigger high inflation, unsustainable debt and an eventual return to sub-par growth.  Slashing personal or corporate tax rates could boost short-term growth as households and businesses spend more, Fed policymakers acknowledged, but those benefits could prove short lived due to broad trends like population aging and rising indebtedness. The remarks about U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed tax overhaul come as he is ramping up a search for a new Fed chair, promising a decision this month. Unless targeted to raise productivity and underlying potential, a tax cut could feed “unsustainable” growth that  could ultimately be undone by asset price bubbles, inflation and possible recession, San Francisco Fed President John Williams told reporters on the sidelines of a community banking conference here on Thursday. “Having policies that don’t kind of maintain this sustainable path, stable inflation, will just end up, we know from history, creating potential recessions or high inflation or other problems and that doesn’t benefit anybody,” he said. White House pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates low in the 1960s in order to boost growth contributed to a subsequent period of so-called stagflation, or low growth and high inflation, in the 1970s, Williams noted.        Williams said he feels the economy as it stands now can on average grow 1.5 percent annually, half the 3 percent growth that Trump has promised, without those sorts of problems.  While tax code changes and other reforms could raise potential, Williams said early analysis of such proposals show they “mostly boost demand and tend to have relatively small” impacts on things like labor supply and productivity growth. Fed officials have traditionally hesitated to speak directly about fiscal issues, leaving tax and spending matters to elected officials. Government officials similarly refrain from commenting on or trying to influence Fed policy.   But the fate of the administration’s tax proposal, its  effect on the economy and the Fed’s possible reaction to it are major unknowns for an economy that is doing well in many respects, with low unemployment and sustained growth since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.    The Trump administration has proposed $6 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts at a time when many economists feel the country is not in need of massive stimulus.  Many of the tax plan details need to be worked out on Capitol Hill, but the broad idea is to offset most of the government revenue lost through lower tax rates by eliminating some tax deductions and loopholes, relying on faster economic growth to take care of the rest. Some of the deductions are already in trouble in Congress, while the effect that tax cuts will have on growth is a matter of controversy even among economists reportedly under consideration by Trump for Fed chair. Stanford visiting fellow and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Columbia University business school dean Glenn Hubbard and Stanford University professor John Taylor, in a general endorsement of the thrust of Trump’s plans, argued in a mid-July report that tax cuts could raise productivity and bring enough people back into the workforce to boost economic growth to 3 percent. But they said that would only happen if the tax cuts were paired with restrictions on entitlement spending, an idea Trump opposed as a candidate when he promised to protect Social Security and Medicare.  “Tax reform and spending reductions go hand-in-hand,” wrote the group. Warsh in particular is considered a possible contender to replace Fed chair Janet Yellen.  “Without significant spending restraint, even with positive effects on economic growth, the tax rate reductions would likely be limited and temporary, limiting their economic benefits.” Dallas Federal Reserve bank president Robert Kaplan earlier this week warned that tax cuts on their own may trade short-term growth for long-term damage. “My concern is you would create a bump in (gross domestic product) that would be short term, you would then decline back down to trend growth except when you declined back down you would be more leveraged than when you started,” he said.

"HENNIKER, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said during a student town hall on Saturday that student loan servicer Navient Corp has been “misleading people” and “doing some really terrible things.” “Their behavior is outrageous,” Clinton said at New England College, where she was campaigning ahead of the state’s nominating contest on Tuesday, Feb. 9. Clinton’s criticism of the student loan servicer comes after she lost badly among young voters to Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders in last week’s Iowa caucus. She received 11 percent of the vote among 17 to 24 year olds who caucused in Iowa versus 86 percent who supported Sanders, according to a NBC News exit poll. Clinton’s statements came in the response to a question from the audience related to student debt. Navient is being investigated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over late fees and other matters, the company revealed in an August regulatory filing. “We understand the politicization of student loans, but we remain focused on delivering excellent service to our customers,” said Navient spokeswoman Patricia Christel in a statement, inviting Clinton to come meet their “hardworking employees and learn firsthand about our industry-leading default prevention work.”   (Reporting by Amanda Becker; Editing by James Dalgleish and Nick Zieminski) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

"If you live in Wisconsin and want your working neighbors to fund your existence, you may need to start peeing in a cup to prove your dependency on the government isn t related to your dependency on drugs. The governor of Wisconsin is a love em  or hate em  kind of leader. Conservatives love him for making public sector unions pay more of their own benefits,  liberals hate him for daring to stand up to the powerful, organized mega-donors of the Democrat Party. Governor Walker is about to shake things up again in the blue state of Wisconsin, and liberals are not gonna be happy Gov. Scott Walker is moving forward with an effort to drug test some food stamp recipients, with testing expected to begin in as little as a year absent action from lawmakers or the federal government.Wisconsin s Republican governor has submitted a plan to state lawmakers for drug testing able-bodied recipients of the state s Food Share program. If the state Legislature doesn t object within 120 days, the plan will go into effect, though it will take at least a year for actual testing to begin.The program won t necessarily have a massive effect, however. The Walker administration estimated in October that only about 220 food stamp recipients statewide   or just 0.3% of able-bodied adults   would test positive in the first year. Employers have jobs available, but they need skilled workers who can pass a drug test,  Walker said in a statement.  This rule change means people battling substance use disorders will be able to get the help they need to get healthy and get back into the workforce. A year ago, Walker had asked then President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration to clear the way for the change in the food stamp program, which is overseen by the state but largely funded by federal taxpayers. So far that hasn t happened but a Walker spokesman said Monday that the governor believes the state can proceed without any federal action. Our position is we have the authority to implement the rule,  spokesman Tom Evenson said.The now-departed appointees of President Barack Obama didn t see it that way. In January 2017, right before Trump took over the White House, the former U.S. official in charge of the replacement program to food stamps said such testing would require a change in federal law. The law clearly does not allow it,  said Kevin Concannon, undersecretary at the federal Food and Nutrition Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Walker s  office forwarded that request to us and it was very clear, we consulted the legal counsels here and the law absolutely does not allow it. The Trump administration, however, may not see the issue in the same light.   Journal Sentinel ",0
"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she wanted to conclude exploratory talks on a possible coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) by mid-January to end Germany s political deadlock. Merkel was asked if comments by her and President Emmanuel Macron that Germany and France hope to make progress on ideas to reform the euro zone by March were realistic, given the risk that talks with the SPD could falter.  I mentioned March because we want to hold exploratory talks by mid-January,  Merkel told reporters after a meeting of the executive board of her Christian Democrats (CDU). Merkel s conservative bloc, weakened in a September election that produced a splintered parliament, will hold their first meeting with the SPD on Wednesday. A deal with the SPD is Merkel s best chance of securing a fourth term as chancellor. She implied there was room for maneuver on policy, but appeared to rule out cooperation outside the framework of a formal coalition. If the exploratory talks are successful, the SPD will move on to negotiate a detailed blueprint with the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, setting out government policy for the next four years.  The SPD agreed to enter talks only reluctantly after voters rewarded it in September for the last four years of  grand coalition  under Merkel by handing it its worst result since 1933. Some in the SPD now want to cooperate with Merkel outside of a formal coalition agreement, in the hope of better preserving a more distinct separate identity in voters  minds. But Merkel said a stable government required formal agreements on policy:  Anything short of that would mean the exploratory talks were not successful.  Should Merkel and SPD leader Martin Schulz fail to reach an agreement, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier could call a new election, something neither party wants as both fear the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) would make more gains. SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil warned Merkel on Monday that party leaders would not win the required blessing from members for renewing their alliance if the SPD gave way on key election promises. He said it would insist on distinctive leftist policies, such as introducing a single  citizen s insurance  to replace the current dual system: superior private health insurance used mainly by the wealthy, and a more widely accessible public health insurance. Conservatives say switching to a unified system would erode competition and worsen services. But Merkel said on Monday that it was possible to find common ground with the SPD on ways to improve the healthcare system. Immigration is another sticking point. The SPD opposes a conservative plan to prolong a halt to the right of some accepted asylum seekers to bring in family members. It says the measure hampers efforts to integrate the 1.6 million people who entered Germany seeking asylum in 2015 and 2016.  Integration works only with families,  Klingbeil said. The CSU, which fears losses to the AfD in an election in Bavaria next year, is likely to put up more resistance to SPD policy demands than the CDU, notably on immigration. ",1
"HANOI (Reuters) -  This isn t like China,  says Vietnamese activist  Anh Chi  at a noisy bar off one of the narrow streets of Hanoi s Old Quarter.  They can t shut Facebook down here.  His 40,000 Facebook followers make him one of Vietnam s better-known critics, but by no means the biggest in a Communist state whose attempts to crack down on dissidents have collided with the rapidly expanding reach of foreign-owned social media. Vietnam s President Tran Dai Quang this month called for unspecified tougher internet controls in the face of  hostile forces  that he said threatened not only cybersecurity but also  undermined the prestige of the leaders of the party and the state . But taming the internet in a young, fast-growing country is not easy, especially when the companies providing the platform are global. China, in contrast, allows only local internet companies operating under strict rules. Vietnam is among Facebook s top 10 countries, by number of members. It now reports more than 52 million active accounts to advertisers, according to research provided to Reuters by social media agencies We Are Social and Hootsuite. Google s YouTube and Twitter are popular too. As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, social media underpins business and communications as well as government critics. Some dissidents posting on social media have been caught in a major crackdown that has followed changes in the ruling party hierarchy. At least 15 people have been arrested this year. High profile bloggers Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as  Mother Mushroom , and Tran Thi Nga have been jailed for 10 and nine years respectively. Government critics also complain of beatings by unidentified assailants and intimidation. But dozens of activists still post critical comment every day. Several have more than 100,000 followers and at least one has over 400,000 - more than double that for the government s own Facebook page and nearly a 10th the size of the Communist Party s national membership.  We use any chance we have to raise our voice: environmental issues, territorial issues, land issues,  said  Anh Chi , 43, a Vietnamese teacher, translator and publisher whose real name is Nguyen Chi Tuyen. Vietnam tried to pressure Facebook (FB.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) to take down thousands items of anti-government content in March by leaning on advertisers, but the continued prevalence suggests limited success. One reason it is hard to take tougher action is business: From brewers to insurers to the makers of the motorbikes buzzing Vietnam s streets, social media is a key marketing route to young and increasingly affluent consumers in an economy growing at more than 6 percent a year, one of the fastest rates in Asia. For small businesses it is crucial: One new silk flower shop in Hanoi told Reuters 95 percent of customers found it through Facebook or Instagram.  You ve got kids that are building businesses on these platforms and generating significant success,  said Simon Kemp, founder of the Kepios marketing consultancy. While it accounts for only a tiny part of Facebook or Google parent Alphabet s revenue, Vietnam is a hot target for global consumer brands. Asia-Pacific was Facebook s fastest growing region by revenue last year, up nearly 60 percent. Tighter Internet controls could dampen innovation and impact the growth of Vietnam s digital economy and its competitiveness, said Jeff Paine, managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition, whose members include Facebook, Google and Twitter. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment. Vietnam s foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters the government was an advocate of the internet but tried to minimize  behaviors that harm users and illegal acts such as inciting violence and a depraved lifestyle . China blocked Facebook in 2009 and only local sites such as WeChat and Weibo are permitted, operating under laws that ban content that is obscene, violent or offends the Communist Party.  China has had remarkable success controlling discussion,  said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow of the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. Tools include keyword filtering by the local internet companies and the close monitoring of big networks, he said. Even so, China has said it is investigating its top social media sites for failing to comply with its laws. Facebook has been blocked in Vietnam occasionally - sometimes at sensitive moments - but never for long.  Vietnamese authorities have tried for years and so far failed to stop independent journalists and bloggers from using the internet,  said Shawn Crispin, Southeast Asia representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists.  It s a losing battle.  That does not stop activists being targeted for arrest. Activist Pham Doan Trang noted on Facebook that some campaigners appeared to have withdrawn from the scene in the face of the crackdown, but said she would not be discouraged.  Freedom has a very funny rule,  she told Reuters  Once people know the limit of freedom they will never go back.  ",1
"CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and other Arab foreign ministers criticized Iran and its Lebanese Shi ite ally Hezbollah at an emergency meeting in Cairo on Sunday, calling for a united front to counter Iranian interference. Regional tensions have risen in recent weeks between Sunni monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Islamist Iran over Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri s surprise resignation, and an escalation in Yemen s conflict. Hariri, a Saudi ally, resigned on Nov. 4 from Riyadh, accusing Iran and Hezbollah of spreading strife. But Lebanese President Michel Aoun and other politicians accused Saudi Arabia of holding Hariri hostage and said he had been coerced into resigning. Saudi Arabia and Hariri both deny that. Hezbollah, both a military force involved in Syria s war and a political movement, is part of a Lebanese government made up of rival factions, and an ally of Aoun. Saudi Arabia also accuses Hezbollah of a role in the launch of a missile towards Riyadh from Yemen this month. Iran denies accusations that it supplies Houthi forces there.   The kingdom will not stand by and will not hesitate to defend its security,  Saudi Arabia s Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir told the assembly.  We must stand together.  The emergency Arab foreign ministers  meeting was convened at the request of Saudi Arabia with support from the UAE, Bahrain, and Kuwait to discuss means of confronting Iranian intervention. In a declaration after the meeting, the Arab League accused Hezbollah of  supporting terrorism and extremist groups in Arab countries with advanced weapons and ballistic missiles.  It said Arab nations would provide details to the U.N. Security Council of Tehran s violations for arming militias in Yemen.  Lebanon s Arab League representative objected to the declaration accusing Hezbollah of terrorism and said it is part of Lebanon s government, the Hezbollah-affiliated al-Manar television channel reported.  United Arab Emirates  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter later that the declaration was a  clear message  about joint Arab action against Iran. Yemen s civil war pits the internationally recognized government, backed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, against the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.  Iranian threats have gone beyond all limits and pushed the region into a dangerous abyss,  Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said.  Unfortunately countries like the Saudi regime are pursuing divisions and creating differences, and because of this they don t see any results other than divisions,  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Iranian state media on Sunday on the sidelines of a meeting in Antalya. Egypt s foreign minister received a call from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday when they also discussed regional tensions over Lebanon, the foreign ministry said in a statement. After French intervention, Hariri flew to France and met President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Saturday. He will arrive in Cairo for a visit on Tuesday, his office said. Speaking in Paris, Hariri said he would clarify his position when he returns to Beirut in the coming days. He said he would take part in Lebanese independence day celebrations, scheduled for Wednesday. ",1
"Democratic Senator Al Franken   who has been accused of kissing a woman without her consent and pretending to grope her in a photo   once pitched an SNL sketch about raping a journalist, it has emerged.The remarks were made in 1995, when Franken and other writers on the show were working up a sketch about then-60 Minutes host Andy Rooney finding a bottle of pills in his desk, New York Magazine reported at the time.As the team batted ideas around, Franken suggested that the pills might be used by Rooney to drug Lesley Stahl at which point he would  take her to the closet and rape her .The sketch was part of an ongoing series in which Norm Macdonald portrayed Rooney as an out-of-touch misanthrope with a tenuous grasp on reality.Macdonald had suggested that Rooney could say  I don t know what the pills are for   what I do know is, the bottle is mostly filled with cotton. Franken then chipped in with:  And,  I give the pills to Lesley Stahl. Then, when Lesley s passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her. Or,  That s why you never see Lesley until February.  Or,  When she passes out, I put her in various positions and take pictures of her. Stahl was a contributor to 60 Minutes at the time. Macdonald then asked,  What if Rooney rapes Mike Wallace? And then says,  I guess that makes me bad.  Is it funnier with a black guy? Or two old white guys? Franken responded:  What about,  I drag Mike into my office and rape him. Right here! I guess that makes me bad. The sketch never made it to air, and it s questionable whether it was ever intended to do so.But the 1995 report has now resurfaced   as it did in 2008, when Franken made his successful run for Minnesota Senator.At the time, his campaign said:  Al understands, and the people of Minnesota understand, the difference between what a satirist does and what a senator does.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress should consider legislation that would regulate “bump stocks,” the attachments that allowed the Las Vegas gunman to fire his semi-automatic rifles more rapidly, U.S. Senator John Cornyn said on Wednesday. Cornyn, the second-ranking Senate Republican, told reporters that if the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) does not have the authority to regulate bump stocks,  “maybe that’s something we ought to consider giving them.” Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was urging panel Chairman Charles Grassley to call a hearing on bump stocks. “I’d like to hear from the ATF who previously during the Obama administration said they didn’t feel like they had the authority to regulate those. I’m not sure I agree with that,” the Texas senator said. On Oct. 1, a gunman in Las Vegas opened fire at an outdoor music festival killing 58 people and injuring nearly 500 others before killing himself, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.  The attachments are legal and allow semiautomatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are heavily restricted in the United States. Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of bump stocks, has announced that it is restarting sales of the product after a pause following the Las Vegas shooting. ",1
"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump was likely to open the door on Monday to a modest increase in U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan, where America is fighting its longest military conflict. In the past, Trump, who took office in January, was critical of former Democratic President Barack Obama’s approach to Afghanistan, saying the United States should not be nation-building and calling for Obama to withdraw troops. Obama also had evolving views, first committing an increase of tens of thousands of U.S. troops to reverse Taliban gains, then committing to a troop drawdown that he was unable to complete before leaving office.  Following are some of Trump’s comments on the war, before and after he launched his White House run in June 2015.   Oct 7, 2011 - When will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding Afghanistan? We must rebuild our country first. (Posted on Twitter, during a year when Obama’s troop surge had taken U.S. troop levels to more than 100,000.) Feb 27, 2012 - It is time to get out of Afghanistan. We are building roads and schools for people that hate us. It is not in our national interests. (Posted on Twitter) Jan 1, 2013 - Can you believe that the Afghan war is our “longest war” ever—bring our troops home, rebuild the U.S., make America great again (Posted on Twitter) March 1, 2013 - We should leave Afghanistan immediately. No more wasted lives. If we have to go back in, we go in hard & quick. Rebuild the US first. (Posted on Twitter) Dec 1, 2014 - Now Obama is keeping our soldiers in Afghanistan for at least another year. He is losing two wars simultaneously. (Posted on Twitter) March 3, 2016 - I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while, because of the fact that you’re right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, and we have to protect that. Nuclear weapons change the game. (Said during a debate among Republican presidential candidates, when asked if he would withdraw troops from Afghanistan) July 18, 2017 - We’ve been there for now close to 17 years, and I want to find out why we’ve been there for 17 years, how it’s going, and what we should do in terms of additional ideas.

U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson issued the 54-page order for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, ruling the state could not cancel Medicaid provider agreements with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, or PPKM, and Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, or PPSLR. “It is uncontroverted that PPKM and PPSLR serve hundreds of underprivileged women in the State of Kansas,” Robinson said in the order. “It is in the public interest to allow these individuals to be treated by the qualified provider of their choice, and to have that provider reimbursed under Medicaid pending a trial on the merits in this case.” The Republican governor ordered state officials to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and its affiliates through the state Medicaid program in January, saying the state would not fund an industry that disrespected life. A spokeswoman for Brownback said in a statement on Tuesday: “The governor will continue the fight to make Kansas a pro-life state. We will review today’s preliminary ruling and move forward with the litigation.” The state sought to cut funding after the release of videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group that activists said showed that Planned Parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue. Neither of the Planned Parenthood affiliates involved in the case participates in fetal tissue donation or sale, court records show. “We are thrilled with the judge’s ruling. We felt strongly that we were going into this on the right side of the law,” said Laura McQuade, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, formerly Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri. The two organizations, along with three of their patients who are on Medicaid, sued the state in May, arguing Brownback’s order would break federal law and violate the U.S. Constitution. Planned Parenthood has denied taking any illegal payments, calling the videos distortions of fetal-tissue donations. The organization has said it has received only reimbursements for its costs, which are legal under U.S. law. Planned Parenthood said in May that at least two dozen states had cut or tried to slash funding to its clinics since the mid-2015 release of the undercover videos. ",1
"Former Representative Gabby Giffords has made a remarkable recovery after suffering a gunshot wound to the head five years ago, but now she is possibly being sued by her attacker.On January 8, 2011, Giffords was speaking to a group of her constituents outside of a Safeway in Casas Adobes, Arizona when Jared Lee Loughner began firing on the crowd. Loughner s bullets killed six people and injured thirteen, including Giffords. The shooter was detained by people at the event and later pleaded guilty to 19 charges related to the shooting   he is currently serving seven consecutive life sentences in prison.However, although he admitted to his crimes and was sentenced accordingly, a lawsuit has allegedly been filed by Loughner against the former congresswoman for $25 million for psychological and emotional distress. It claims claims that he is innocent and was hand-picked  to be an assassin. My incarceration is illegal. I am actually innocent. I was Framed. I am a victim of project mk-ultra the govt. put a chip in my head to control my mind .Gabby Giffords is in the Illuminati and I have evidence of this I was handpicked illegally to be a sleeper assassin. MY HEAD is full of chips and this evil empire govt is controlling me within. The lawsuit claims all sorts of other insane things, as well. It says that he has been waterboarded repeatedly during his incarceration by the ATF, NSA and CIA. The suit also alleges that his attorney is a  global spy  who forced him to plead guilty and that authorities are making him sick from  microwave testing  and  chemtrails.  It even accuses Giffords of funding the San Bernardino shooters.The timing of this lawsuit has made some people think that it is a hoax. Just days before it was filed, a similar lawsuit was filed in Michigan against Uber, supposedly by the Kalamazoo mass shooter, Jason Brian Dalton. That lawsuit turned out to be fake and apparently the Giffords  suit looks a lot like the Dalton suit. Tucson News reports:The envelopes of both the alleged Loughner lawsuit and the fake Dalton lawsuit have very similar characteristics.Both have the same three stamps in the top right corner, have similar handwriting and are postmarked in Philadelphia, PA.The envelopes, do indeed look very similar and when you read Loughner s alleged lawsuit there seems to be a whole lot of crazy crammed into it. Almost an unbelievable amount, in fact.Addicting Info will keep you updated on this story as it develops.Read the  Loughner complaint HERE.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0
"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland hopes Turkey will eventually join the European Union, Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Tuesday, days ahead of an EU summit which will discuss the frayed relations between Brussels and Ankara. The EU, particularly heavyweight member Germany, has become increasingly critical of Turkey since President Tayyip Erdogan launched large-scale purges of state institutions, the military, the judiciary and academia after a failed coup in July 2016.  Poland has supported and (also) today supports Turkey s EU accession efforts,  Duda told a joint news conference with  Erdogan during his visit to Warsaw.  I hope Turkey and the EU will continue on the same path ... leading to a full membership for Turkey.  EU leaders will discuss the bloc s deteriorating ties with Ankara on Oct. 19 during a two-day summit.  Turkey s 12-year-long accession talks, already dogged by disputes on a range of issues, have ground to a halt since the post-coup crackdown, in which more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 - including judges, journalists and soldiers - have been sacked or suspended. Within the EU, Poland has traditionally been among the most staunch supporters of enlargement, including Turkey s accession. Erdogan, speaking alongside Duda, reiterated his criticism of the EU s accession policy, saying the bloc should announce the end of talks if it doesn t mean to accept Turkey.  We won t bother you any further and you don t bother us,  he said. ",1

" The banality of evil  is how Ann McElhinney, co-producer of the  Gosnell  movie describes meeting with serial murderer, Dr. Kermit Gosnell. In her emotional interview with Dana Loesch, Ann describes her visit as  chilling  and  sitting in the presence of evil. Ann McElhinney recently interviewed Kermit Gosnell, an abortionist sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder, for a movie she and her husband are making about the man. She said she couldn t speak for more than an hour after the interview concluded because of how profoundly disturbing the experience was. He has an answer for everything,  McElhinney said on TheBlaze TV s Dana.  He lives in his own world. Every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie. He lies so easily. McElhinney said she has met many criminals throughout her journalistic career, but with Gosnell she said  you are really sitting in the presence of evil. It s almost like all of those literature references to evil and to the devil. He smiles all the time,  McElhinney said, visibly shaken.  He touched my leg. He was physically inappropriate   sat far, far too close in my personal space. Extremely disturbing. McElhinney said Gosnell is  really happy  and  relaxed  in prison, and started singing twice during the interview in which she asked him about the baby who was born alive during a botched abortion, whose neck he then  snipped  with a scissors. I haven t met anyone who chilled my blood to that extent ever before,  she concluded.  This man has no sense of guilt. Via: The Blaze",0
"BERLIN (Reuters) - An EU agreement with Britain on relations after Brexit could serve as a model for ties with other countries that want to be as close as possible to the bloc but are not yet ready to join, such as Ukraine and Turkey, Germany s foreign minister said. Britain secured the go-ahead from Brussels to start talks on its future relationship with the EU earlier this month, with London saying it aspires to a closer relationship as a former member than that of any other third country. In an interview with the Funke newspaper group published on Tuesday, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said such a deal could offer a solution to the puzzle of how the bloc of 27 can manage its ties with two other large non-members.  I can t imagine Turkey or Ukraine becoming EU members in the next few years,  he said.  If we get a smart agreement with Britain regulating relations with Europe after Brexit, that could be a model for other countries - Ukraine and also Turkey.  Turkey, a candidate for EU membership for decades, already has a customs union with the EU which allows the trade of most goods without tariffs.  One possibility would be to offer Ankara a  new, closer form of the customs union , Gabriel said, although he also said such a project would have to wait for changes in Turkey s political environment. Thousands of people, including German citizens, have been detained in Turkey as part of a government crackdown since a failed coup in 2016. An agreement between the EU and Ukraine on a  deep and comprehensive free trade area  formally came into force in September, aimed at allowing free trade of goods, services and capital, and visa-free travel for people for short stays. Ukraine s desire for closer ties with the EU was one of the driving forces behind a popular revolt that toppled a pro-Russian president in 2014, leading Moscow to seize Ukraine s Crimea peninsula and back pro-Russian separatists in a still-unresolved conflict in the east of the country. Gabriel s Social Democratic Party (SPD) is preparing for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives on governing together for another four years. ",1
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s rollback on his predecessor’s liberalization of travel to Cuba will all but eliminate a burgeoning market for independent tourism, forcing would-be visitors into organized trips, experts said. That policy change could be bad news for airlines that have been helped by demand from solo travelers and families who have booked seats for ad-hoc informal “cultural exchanges” that had passed muster under former President Barack Obama’s loosened rules.  “It’s going to frustrate airlines who scheduled service on the premise that travel restrictions would eventually be removed,” Robert Mann, analyst at R.W. Mann & Co, said. “It was an ‘if you build it they will come’ kind of a philosophy.” Now, under directives announced by Trump on Friday, independent travel to Cuba from the United States will once again be forbidden, complicating the already tricky-to-navigate industry.  The new policy will ban most U.S. business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group, a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, including the hotel and hospitality industry, but make some exceptions, including air and sea travel. [nL1N1JD02O] The president’s directive will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines now serving the island but dim a potentially bright outlook for travel growth between the countries.  While the industry at large is bracing for weakened demand following the policy shift, specialized travel agents could potentially see a windfall as travelers rush to book authorized organized trips to the island. “You can’t get through to our call line. We’re receiving 10 times the emails we were this morning,” Tom Popper, president of travel agency InsightCuba, which organizes legal group tours of the tourism-restricted island, said on Friday. U.S. cruise operators and airlines could lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the Trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel, Washington lobby group Engage Cuba said in a recent report. (tmsnrt.rs/2rBfMTI) While Trump’s new policy avoids the worst-case scenario of cancelling all commercial flights or severing diplomatic relations, it will still be a blow to a tourism sector betting on Cuba as a new high-growth market.   “If the goal is to help Cuban entrepreneurs, adding job-killing regulations on U.S. businesses and increasing government resources to investigate everyday Americans traveling to our island neighbor is not the answer,” James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, said in a statement.     Marriott International Inc on Friday urged the White House to improve relations with post-Castro Cuba and recognize tourism as a strategic tool in the effort. Marriott, the world’s biggest hotel chain, operates the Gaviota 5th Avenue Hotel, which is owned by the Cuban military. The Treasury Department said on its website that travel-related commercial engagements established before new regulations from the Office of Foreign Assets Control will be permitted, which appears to exempt the Marriott venture. Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said airlines are reviewing the directive and “will continue to comply with all federal rules and regulations regarding travel to Cuba.” Obama’s initial opening prompted a dash to launch flights into Cuba in mid-2016. Some early entrants, including smaller carriers Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways and Spirit Airlines Inc, have pulled out. While larger U.S. carriers have pared back flights to smaller Cuban cities, American Airlines, Delta, United Continental, Southwest and JetBlue have requested additional flight clearances on various routes to Havana.  Cruise operator Carnival Corp downplayed any impact from the change, saying it was “pleased” its ships could continue to sail to Cuba. ",1
"You have to love the Republican party. They call themselves the party of  family values.  They hold themselves to a  higher moral standard.  They think they are spiritually superior because they statistically go to church more often than Democrats. All of those things, however, are underscored by the one thing that defines Republicans more than anything else: Hypocrisy.The GOP-controlled Missouri state legislature is considering a bill from Rep Bart Korman that would require the  gift  of sex with a lobbyist to be disclosed, but not with a monetary value. Take your time and read it again; your eyes aren t deceiving you. The actual wording of the bill states: the term  gift  shall include sexual relations between a registered lobbyist and a member of the general assembly or his or her staff. Relations between married persons or between persons who entered into a relationship prior to the registration of the lobbyist, the election of the member to the general assembly, or the employment of the staff person shall not be reportable under this subdivision. The reporting of sexual relations for purposes of this subdivision shall not require a dollar valuation. So .yeah. If you re married to a lobbyist or are in an actual relationship with a lobbyist you re good, but if you re boinking one for political gain you have to report it without attaching a dollar value. That little stipulation would presumably keep parties involved from being charged with solicitation.There is some speculation that the bill has its origins in a political quagmire of corruption that Korman himself is at the center of. According to our friends at Freak Out Nation:What we have here is a classic kindergarten game of  if I can t have it, neither can you  that dates back to a kerfuffle related to a fancypants dinner  meeting  held in January 2015.  The House Telecommunications Committee, which is led by none other than Rep. Korman, held a  meeting  at the Jefferson City Country Club, where the men dined on fancy steaks and other high priced entrees.  Oh, and this dinner was fully paid for by a lobbying group that the Committee oversees.The press got wind of it and the public was so incensed that Speaker John Diehl ordered all future meetings be held at the Capital. Rep. Korman tried to justify the Committee s actions by saying that meeting at the club for dinner was the only time the group could congregate.So here we are, one year later, and Rep. Korman proposes this quite bizarre Bill that requires sex be listed as a  gift.  What does that mean, though? Is he insinuating that lobbyists are engaging in sexual activity with lawmakers on a regular basis? Is this directed specifically at Speaker Diehl or another member of the House? So many questions and no answers yet.Political shenanigans need to be called out on this one for sure, but alas Missouri is Missouri. Republicans in red states seldom feel the need to explain themselves. Should the public become concerned with issues they don t want to deal with they can simply introduce a bill limiting abortion, taking food stamps from children or removing any and all gun restrictions on the books.Shiny object politics at its finest.Featured image via Wikipedia",0
"B..b..but That can t be right Maybe we should change the way we poll The Reuters/Ipsos polling team announced Friday that they are dropping the  Neither  option from their presidential preference polls after their tracking polls showed a 17-point swing in favor of the Republican nominee Donald J. Trump, exposing the  Secret Trump Voters  Democrats fear. In a presidential campaign notable for its negativity, the option of  Neither  candidate appears to be an appealing alternative, at least to participants in the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll,  wrote Maurice Tamman, the leader of the Reuters news service s New York City-based data mining and investigative reporting team.  Many voters on both sides have been ambivalent in their support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, complicating the task of the pollsters trying to track the race. Breitbart News noted the 17-point swing for Trump, which seems to have set off alarm bells at Reuters.Reuters has a reputation for accurate polling, so it is significant that Mamman made this decision as the presidential campaign enters its last 100 days with both conventions adjourned. In the nearly five years Reuters/Ipsos has been offering the  Neither/Other  option to respondents in presidential polling, it has never yielded such a skew,  he wrote.  The results highlight how poll designs and methodologies can yield significantly differing results, and how important differences can emerge from the way a question is framed. The real problem this year s polling presents to Democrats is the reluctance, especially among more educated voters, to confess their support of Trump. Other pollsters have noted the divergence between polls conducted with live operators and robo-phone calls. Live operators have long been considered the preferred, most accurate method inside the polling community. However, live operator polls uniformly show lower support for Trump than online or automatic-dial phone polls.Much has been made of Trump s lack of support among college-educated whites, a stronghold of Republican support, but it could very well be that these people, susceptible to social perceptions, have not abandoned the Republican nominee but are giving the socially acceptable answer until they are alone in the voting booth.

"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the club decided to play Sunday s game against Las Palmas behind closed doors to show opposition to police violence against voters in Catalonia s independence referendum and not over safety concerns. La Liga leaders Barca s 3-0 win at an empty Nou Camp came on the day Catalan officials said that more than 760 people were injured in clashes between police and people trying to vote in the referendum, which the national government declared illegal. Barca tried to have the game postponed but were told by La Liga that there were no grounds to do so in the interests of safety. If Barcelona, who have won their opening seven league games of the season, had postponed the match without the league s consent they would have been docked six points.  This (playing without fans) was a measure to show our rejection of what took place today,  Bartomeu told television network BeIn Sports.  This is not a security issue, the police gave us permission to play, but we wanted to show that this game was different because of everything that is happening in Catalonia and the lack of liberty we have been suffering from.  We decided that instead of postponing the game, which is what we wanted, we d play behind closed doors. That way we show our concern for the situation and send our support to those who have been unable to exercise the right to freedom of expression.  Police hit people with batons, fired rubber bullets into crowds and forcibly removed would-be voters from polling stations in actions that were condemned internationally but described by the government as  proportionate . The referendum has pitched the country into its deepest constitutional crisis in decades and deepened a centuries-old rift between Madrid and Barcelona.  If we hadn t played we d have lost six points, three for the result and three as a punishment,  added Bartomeu.  There was no reason for us to lose points, all our fans should appreciate that we showed our disagreement with what happened.  Barca are five points clear at the top of La Liga. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique broke down in tears in a post-match interview and indicated he did not want to play after Sunday s events in Catalonia.  The board tried to postpone the game through every means possible and came down to the dressing room to take a decision with us,  Pique said.  Today has been a very tough day, probably the hardest since I ve been a professional. My opinion counts for little and in the end we all agreed to play.  La Liga and Las Palmas wanted to play, and we had to think about the points, but I understand everyone who has criticised us for playing.  Pique was also critical of the Spanish government and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for their handling of the referendum.  The government s policies are some of the worst we have seen for 40 or 50 years. All they have done is separate Catalonia and Spain ever more. I m sure there will be consequences,  said Pique. ",1
"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The Republican National Convention was in an uproar on Monday after opponents of presumptive U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump failed in their effort to hold a roll-call vote in opposition to his candidacy. The anti-Trump forces at the Cleveland convention started shouting “Roll Call” after the party leaders approved by acclamation rules at the start of the convention that barred them from registering their opposition. Party leaders declared there was insufficient support to allow for a roll-call vote that would record the number of delegates opposed to Trump, a New York businessman who has never held political office and has struggled to win over many mainstream Republicans. Some delegates walked out of the convention in protest at the leaders’ ruling while others chanted loudly, demanding a roll-call vote take place. Trump last week declared the so-called “Never Trump” movement dead, tweeting that “#NeverTrump is never more.” ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will pummel foes and embrace friends in his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly next week, keeping pressure on Washington s adversaries North Korea  and Iran, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Friday. Briefing reporters ahead of the annual U.N. meeting, Haley and White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster took a tough line on North Korea, warning that a military option to deal with its nuclear threats was available. Trump will meet with leaders from Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America throughout the week, but his remarks, scheduled for Tuesday morning, will be the president s highest profile opportunity to explain his foreign policy vision couched in his  America first  agenda.  I personally think he slaps the right people, he hugs the right people, and he comes out with (the) U.S. being very strong, in the end,  Haley, speaking at the White House, said of Trump s speech. Haley declined to say whether Trump would commit Washington to maintaining its current level of funding for the 193-nation body. Trump has complained that the United States funds 22 percent of the U.N. budget and nearly 30 percent of U.N. peacekeeping duties. Trump will kick off the week with a meeting about U.N. reform on Monday. He will then have meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that will focus on Iran, McMaster said. Trump has dinner scheduled with Latin American leaders. On Tuesday, he will meet Qatar s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Trump said last week he would be willing to mediate the worst dispute in decades between Qatar and U.S.-allied Arab states. On Wednesday, he will meet with leaders from Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Britain and Egypt and on Thursday there are talks scheduled with leaders from Turkey, Afghanistan and Ukraine before holding a lunch with the leaders of South Korea and Japan. McMaster said it was unlikely that Trump would speak to Venezuela s President Nicolas Maduro, whom the White House has sanctioned and called a dictator. ",1
"A day after a plagiarism scandal rocked Melania Trump for the portions of her convention speech that were lifted from Michelle Obama, Donald Trump s son Donald Jr. faces a similar allegation.? pic.twitter.com/QEftnTTwy3  The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) July 20, 2016The Twitter account for The Daily Show made the catch, pointing out a passage in Donald Trump Jr. s speech that appears to have been lifted from an article in a conservative magazine.In the speech, Trump pointed out that  our schools used to be an elevator to the middle class. Now they re stalled on the ground floor. In an article in The American Conservative, writer F.H. Buckley writes,  What should be an elevator to the upper class is stalled on the ground floor. In a later sentence, Buckley went on to say,  our schools and universities are like the old Soviet department stores whose mission was to serve the interests of the sales clerks and not the customers. In his speech to the convention, praising his father, Donald Trump Jr. said: [Schools are] like Soviet-era department stores that are run for the benefit of the clerks and not the customers. The writer, Buckley, then said in an interview with CNN that he  was a principal speech writer for the speech. So it s not an issue. If not a direct copy like the Melania/Obama issue, the incident continues to highlight the manner in which the Trump team continues to botch the basics of running a convention, which has been echoed in their lack of preparation for the general election.All day long the Trump campaign tried to fight back on the story of Melania s plagiarism, first claiming that it didn t happen, then arguing that since it was only 7 percent of the speech it didn t matter, then blaming speechwriters when she said I an interview with NBC that she wrote it herself.Talk of the speech dominated the day when in most traditional campaigns the presentation from the nominee s spouse would have generated positive headlines.Donald Trump Jr. himself blamed the speechwriters and not his stepmother for the incident, telling CBS News,  Of course [Melania] worked with speechwriters. Having never done this before, you have to work with speechwriters. Those are the people that did this. Featured image via Twitter",0
"By now, it s pretty clear that Bernie doesn t respect other people s possessions. His whole campaign is built on the concept of stealing what belongs to other people. This story should really come as no surprise to anyone Officials with the Democratic National Committee have accused the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of improperly accessing confidential voter information gathered by the rival campaign of Hillary Clinton, according to several party officials.Jeff Weaver, the Vermont senator s campaign manager, acknowledged that a staffer had viewed the information but blamed a software vendor hired by the DNC for a glitch that allowed access. Weaver said one Sanders staffer was fired over the incident.The discovery sparked alarm at the DNC, which promptly shut off the Sanders campaign s access to the strategically crucial list of likely Democratic voters.The DNC maintains the master list and rents it to national and state campaigns, which then add their own, proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers. Firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by their rivals.NGP VAN, the vendor that handles the master file, said the incident occurred Wednesday while a patch was being applied to the software. The process briefly opened a window into proprietary information from other campaigns, said the company s chief, Stu Trevelyan. He said a full audit will be conducted.The DNC has told the Sanders campaign that it will not be allowed access to the data again until it provides an explanation as well as assurances that all Clinton data has been destroyed.Having his campaign cut off from the national party s voter data is a strategic setback for Sanders   and could be a devastating blow if it lasts. The episode also raises questions about the DNC s ability to provide strategic resources to campaigns and state parties.Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said four Sanders campaign staffers accessed Clinton data, and that three of them did so at the direction of their boss, Josh Uretsky, who was the operative fired.Uretsky told CNN Friday morning that he and others on the campaign discovered the software glitch Wednesday morning and probed the system to discover the extent of their own data s exposure. He said there was no attempt to take Clinton information but said he took responsibility for the situation. We investigated it for a short period of time to see the scope of the Sanders campaign s exposure and then the breach was shut down presumably by the vendor,  he told CNN.  We did not gain any material benefit. Weaver said the Sanders campaign never downloaded or printed any of the data, meaning it is no longer in possession of any proprietary information. He squarely blamed NGP VAN for the glitch   and blamed the DNC for hiring the company.He said the campaign has flagged similar problems with the software for the DNC in the past.For entire story: Washington Post",0
"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States presented a draft Security Council resolution on Thursday it negotiated with China that would dramatically tighten existing restrictions on North Korea after its Jan. 6 nuclear test and create the toughest U.N. sanctions regime in over two decades. The draft, seen by Reuters, would require U.N. member states to conduct mandatory inspections of all cargo passing through their territory to or from North Korea to look for illicit goods. Previously states were only required to do this if they had reasonable grounds to believe there was illicit cargo. The United States used the nearly two months of bilateral negotiations that at one point involved President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, diplomats said, to win China’s support for unusually tough measures intended to persuade its ally North Korea to abandon its atomic weapons program. The proposal would close a gap in the U.N. arms embargo on Pyongyang by banning all weapons imports and exports.  There would also be an unprecedented ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could directly contribute to the operational capabilities of the North Korean armed forces, such as trucks that could be modified for military purposes. Other proposed measures include a ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea, a requirement for states to expel North Korean diplomats engaging in illicit activities, and blacklisting 17 North Korean individuals and 12 entities, including the National Aerospace Development Agency or ‘NADA’, the body responsible for February’s rocket launch.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters the new measures, if approved, would be “the strongest set of sanctions imposed by the Security Council in more than two decades.” Several council diplomats predicted a Saturday meeting to adopt the draft but Russian deputy U.N. ambassador Petr Iliichev told Reuters Moscow needed time to study the draft and the earliest likely vote would be next week. The draft was the result of seven weeks of tough negotiations between the United States and China, North Korea’s neighbor and main ally. “This is a very robust resolution,” a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. “Clearly this took a long time ... it was a difficult process.” North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 because of its multiple nuclear tests and rocket launches. China and the United States had differed on how strongly to respond to Pyongyang’s most recent test, with Washington urging harsh punitive measures and Beijing emphasizing dialogue and milder U.N. steps confined to non-proliferation. The Global Times, an influential Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial that North Korea “deserves the punishment” of new sanctions, but China should “cushion Washington’s harsh sanctions to some extent.”  “China insists the sanctions should focus on striking North Korea’s ability to continue developing nuclear weapons. It is the fundamental difference between China’s policy and that of the U.S., South Korea and Japan. China holds unswerving goodwill toward North Korea, which Chinese society hopes Pyongyang can understand,” it said. Diplomats said a sharp tightening of restrictions was necessary since Pyongyang has proved its determination to flout at all costs attempts at constraining its nuclear and missile programs.  They said they hoped the latest measures would make it harder for North Korea to continue with that policy, keeping up the pressure on the country’s leadership without making the country’s impoverished population any poorer. “Pyongyang has prioritized the pursuit of these massively expensive programs over absolutely everything else,” the U.S. official said. “So is New York action going to automatically convince the regime’s leaders to cease? I think we’re realistic on that point.” However, he added that “this resolution will be felt, it will have an impact ... The DPRK (North Korea) have never been subject to the kind of pressure that is in the resolution.”  Power said the measures were aimed at the country’s leadership, and “careful not to punish the North Korean people.” In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing on Thursday: “We hope and believe this new resolution can help effectively constrain North Korea from further developing its nuclear missile program”. There will also be further restrictions aimed at making it more difficult for North Korea to press ahead with its nuclear and missile programs. Pyongyang is currently banned from importing and exporting nuclear and missile technology and is not allowed to import luxury goods. The list of banned items will be expanded. The U.S. official said one of five annexes to the resolution lists 31 ships owned by North Korean shipping firm Ocean Maritime Management Company Limited, which will be blacklisted.  Also new, countries will be required, not just encouraged, to freeze the assets of North Korean entities linked to Pyongyang’s nuclear or missile programs and to prohibit the opening of new branches or offices of North Korean banks or to engage in banking correspondence with North Korean banks.

Hariri announced his resignation from his post on Nov. 4 in a televised statement from Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy and regional powerhouse locked in a confrontation with Shi ite Iran. Hezbollah is fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Gulf monarchies have accused the Shi ite group of also supporting the Houthi group in Yemen and of backing militants in Bahrain. Hezbollah denies any activity in Yemen or Bahrain. Hariri s resignation pitched Lebanon to the forefront of a regional power tussle this month between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which backs Hezbollah. The two regional powers back competing factions in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. After returning to Lebanon this week, he shelved the decision on Wednesday at the request of President Michel Aoun, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions in the Middle East. Following his announcement, made on Lebanon s independence day, hundreds of Hariri supporters packed the streets near his house in central Beirut, waving the blue flag of his Future Movement political party. On Saturday, he said that his decision to wait instead of officially resigning is to give a chance to discuss and look into demands that will make Lebanon neutral and allow it to enforce its  disassociation  policy.  Disassociation  is widely understood in Lebanon to mean its policy of staying out of regional conflicts. The regional role played by the Hezbollah political and military movement has greatly alarmed Saudi Arabia, Hariri s long-time ally. On Saturday, Hezbollah s International Relations Officer Ammar Moussawi said that the Shi ite group is ready to reach understandings with  our partners in the country , and that the group is open to real dialogue and cooperation with all, Lebanon s state news agency NNA reported. Moussawi added that Hariri s resignation, which he said was done under coercion from Riyadh, was a spark that aimed to ignite Lebanon. Top Lebanese Druze politician Walid Jumblatt on Saturday called on Saudi Arabia to enter dialogue with Iran and said that the kingdom s modernization plans could not work while Riyadh was engaged in a war in Yemen.

"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - At least 6 people died on Sunday after a suicide bomber blew himself up in a restaurant just outside a senior official s office in the central Somali city of Beledweyne, police and residents said. The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group said it was behind the attack.  At least six people died and several others were wounded. A suicide bomber blew up himself in a restaurant,  major Hussein Osman, a police officer told Reuters from Beledweyne. The Sunday afternoon blast took place outside the office of the governor of the Hiran region, where he was holding a meeting, police and residents said.  We are behind the attack at the Hiran governor s headquarters. There are casualties. We targeted the workers of the Hiran administration,  said Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab s military operation spokesman. Beledweyne is about 340 km north of Mogadishu. Residents said clan elders were among the dead.  The suicide bomber who had an explosive jacket stood inside the restaurant and blew up himself. We were heading to a meeting in the governor s office when it happened,  Farah Ali, a local elder, told Reuters. Somalia has been at war since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other. Al Shabaab has in the past carried out frequent attacks in Mogadishu and other parts of Somalia in a bid to topple the country s Western-backed government and drive out African Union peacekeeping troops. Al Shabaab also wants to impose its strict interpretation of Islam in Somalia. ",1
"As a side note, Paul Ryan still needs 18 additional votes to ensure his new role as Speaker Of The House. The full House is expected to elect Ryan as Speaker in a formal floor vote Thursday morning, transferring the gavel from Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who is resigning Friday after a quarter century in Congress.Republicans on Wednesday rallied behind Rep. Paul Ryan to be the next Speaker of the House, declaring him the best candidate to turn the page and unify a fractured GOP conference.Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and the 2012 vice presidential nominee, easily defeated his only rival for the top job, GOP Rep. Daniel Webster, a former Speaker in the Florida statehouse.Ryan routed Webster in a 200-43 vote during a closed-door conference meeting in the cavernous Ways and Means hearing room where Ryan now presides as committee chairman. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) received one vote, as did Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).Ryan will need 218 votes to be elected Speaker on the House floor. He is expected to receive more GOP votes now that he has won the conference election.Boehner in last year s election led his party to the largest House majority in generations, but he faced an uprising this fall from conservatives who threatened to oust him from power.For now, Ryan has support from most of the 40 members of the far-right Freedom Caucus, but he ll have to wrestle with the same conservative forces that pushed out his predecessor and scuttled McCarthy s own bid for the Speakership.Wednesday s internal vote came just hours after Ryan announced he would back a sweeping two-year deal that raises spending caps and the debt ceiling. Conservatives had urged him to oppose the pact because the White House, Boehner and other top congressional leaders negotiated it behind closed doors.But the agreement eliminates the possibility of a government shutdown or debt default through the 2016 elections. In a statement, Ryan said it gives Republicans a chance to  wipe the slate clean. House Republicans are eager for a fresh start after the turmoil that defined the Boehner era.As he s wooed his colleagues the past week, Ryan has said he s open to changes to internal rules and procedure that would give rank-and-file members more power to decide things like which bills come to the floor and who should serve on which committees. Last Friday, he told conservatives leaders that, unlike Boehner, he would not seek retribution against Republicans who buck GOP leadership.In a private candidates  forum Wednesday morning, Ryan told colleagues he wouldn t operate as  Caesar,  gesturing with a thumbs-up and a thumbs down   reenacting a scene from the action flick  Gladiator. He said,  I don t plan to be Caesar,  deciding the fate of everything from the Speaker s office, calling all the shots,  said Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), a Freedom Caucus leader who is backing Ryan.Ryan s only competition for the job came from Webster, who received a dozen votes in his challenge to Boehner in the Speaker s race in January. But Webster rubbed some supporters the wrong way when he gave a short speech at the Wednesday forum, then refused to take questions and bolted out the door to attend another engagement.One former Webster supporter said the candidate sent a fundraising email to his wife, explaining that he s running for Speaker and imploring her to donate money. He won t ask for my vote but he s asking for money,  the GOP lawmaker quipped.By contrast, Ryan stayed at the candidate s forum for more than an hour, fielding questions from dozens of his colleagues until they had nothing left to ask. Some pressed him to explain his support for the bipartisan budget deal, said lawmakers who attended the event. He s supporting the budget because he doesn t want to have these cliffs or crises,  said freshman Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), who worked on the Romney-Ryan presidential campaign in 2012. Via: The HillRep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) endorsement of Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) for Speaker of the House has drawn new attention to Ryan s two-decade history of pushing for open borders immigration policies. A previously little noticed 2013 video of Ryan and Gutierrez stumping for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) amnesty bill in which the two make a candid pitch for unlimited immigration shows just how far Ryan is willing to go to push for open borders policies.In the wide-ranging 53 minute video, which took place in Chicago, both Gutierrez and Ryan outline their shared plan for adopting open borders: that is, a national policy of allowing companies to bring in and hire as many foreign workers as they would like. This  free movement  of people across national boundaries is the centerpiece of the open borders ideology to which Ryan has devoted much of his career.The video is entitled:  Rep. Paul Ryan and Rep. Luis Gutierrez Push For Immigration Reform.  The two Congressional partners lay out an immigration plan that is far more radical in scope than many would have imagined, and absent from virtually all major media coverage of the Ryan speakership push. The video gives fresh insight into what legislation Paul Ryan would advance  and what legislation he would block if given the Speaker s gavel.In the video, Ryan begins by adopting a left-wing narrative about GOP voters and suggesting that their opposition to mass migration is fueled by  ignorance.  Ryan rejects the idea that America is  a country  i.e. a land with a fixed border and heritage but instead an  idea  since ideas don t have borders.Ryan says:[America] is not just a country. America is an idea. It s an idea that people from all over the world to aspire to achieve  There is no other economic system, no other immigration system that has done more to lift people out of poverty than the American free enterprise system, and American immigration system that we have here. That s what makes us proud. So the question is: what do we do to restore this? [ ] We ve had plenty of waves of immigration that have always been met with resistance in the past the Irish wave is just but one of them. Each wave is met with some ignorance, is met with some resistance.Ryan appears to be taking a page from his mentor Jack Kemp, who  as Ann Coulter has written  had a habit of smearing blue-collar voters of his own party if they opposed his expansionist agenda. via: Breitbart News",0
"It s no accident that President Obama named Vanita Gupta acting head of the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ. Gupta is beloved by the radical left for her militant hostility toward law enforcement officers. Here s a fantastic overview from J. Christian Adams who has intimate knowledge of what s going on at the DOJ. He worked  there and knows just how the DOJ has been turned into a politicized radical leftist entity of the Obama administration. Here s an example of that:Vanita Gupta, head of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, has told a lawyers group in Colorado that slavery and Jim Crow helped fuel the Ferguson and Baltimore riots.The last few days have seen a number of fanciful stories with the Obama administration seemingly questioning the authority of local police. I ve long maintained that the administration is nakedly seeking to federalize policing standards   but get rid of local police? No way, that sounds like something broadcast from a shortwave station in Austin, Texas. But then up steps Vanita Gupta to lend some credibility to the idea that some want to disband local police and replace police powers with the federal government. Speaking to a group of left-wing lawyers in Colorado, Gupta had this to say:The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have police or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve.There is no question that we need police in our communities.The conversation? What conversation is Gupta hearing that needs to be corrected? Who brought up the idea we might not need police? Nobody sane, for sure.If you read the entirety of Gupta s speech, you ll get a sense of what is going on in the mind of the anti-police left. Officials in this administration still think it is rational and acceptable to bring up the name Michael Brown in the context of anything other than a likely felon against whom deadly force was justifiably used. Behold Gupta:Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. Their deaths and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with police officers, have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering.In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in officer-involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration   the lack of trust in the police   is real, and it is profound.Gupta asks the question that many Americans have already asked and answered:It s worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it?To most law-abiding Americans, the idea of fleeing from the police, or worse, charging at a policeman you have already punched, is simply beyond the realm of possibility.So how did we get here? Was it a breakdown of values? Perhaps a pervasive tolerance for lawlessness? Of course not. Says Gupta:Let s start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can t be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It s in part the product of historical awareness about the role that police have played in enforcing and perpetuating (wait for it! here it comes!) slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation.Read more: pjmediaRead more: pjmedia",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday agreed to expand the use of disaster aid to help rebuild Puerto Rico s power grid and other infrastructure wrecked by Hurricane Maria, the White House said. In a unique agreement recognizing both the massive devastation on the island and its dire financial problems, aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for infrastructure projects will be released in a faster, more flexible way than is typical after disasters, a senior White House official told Reuters. The plan, agreed to with Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, will also provide for third-party advisers to estimate how much money is requires for big-ticket projects, and how it is spent - a provision aimed at protecting taxpayer dollars in what is expected to be a massive, long-term effort to rebuild the island.  We re doing it in a way that grants flexibility, but also imposes a mutually agreed upon set of controls,  the official said in an interview. The new agreement will see FEMA cover 90 percent of the costs for rebuilding public infrastructure, up from the typical level of 75 percent. Puerto Rico - home to 3.4 million Americans - is in bankruptcy, struggling with $72 billion in debt. Its finances were put under federal control last year. Six weeks after Hurricane Maria hit, only about 30 percent of Puerto Rico s power grid has been restored. Private sector estimates of total damage from Maria have ranged as high as $95 billion. The White House is expected to deliver a new request for disaster aid to the U.S. Congress in mid-November to help defray costs from Maria and two other major hurricanes - Harvey and Irma - as well as damage caused by wildfires in the western United States. It is not yet clear how big the federal tab for Puerto Rico will be.  Obviously it s going to be a big dollar figure,  the official said.  I know there won t be any balking at the amount of money needed from the administration.  Even with FEMA covering 90 percent of the costs, it could be difficult for the territorial government to put up its 10 percent. On top of its fiscal constraints, the storm has ground its economy - and tax revenues - to a halt. The federal government provided a $150 million loan in an aid package approved by Congress last month that can be used to help cover its share, the official said.          We didn t want to create the precedent of giving 100 percent in the grant program and then disincentivizing good stewardship,  the official said. The federal government will also use relatively new procedures created in 2013 after Hurricane Sandy known as  Section 428  in the Stafford Act, the law that provides for federal disaster aid.  It s not been used on this scale before,  the official said. The procedures will allow Puerto Rico to estimate the costs of big projects up front - with help from third-party advisers - and draw down from approved grants, eliminating the slow and cumbersome process of being reimbursed for upfront spending on each segment. The agreement will also allow Puerto Rico to access hazard mitigation grants - normally tapped only outside of disasters - while rebuilding the creaky power grid and other infrastructure so that the structures are more resilient to future hurricanes.  We re going to build them back smarter,  the official said. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A five-week summer break might sound sweet to many people, but maybe not to the 292 Republicans in Congress who leave Washington with none of their major legislative goals achieved after six months in power alongside President Donald Trump. With Congress due to be closed until Sept. 5, voters may ask: What happened to repealing and replacing Obamacare? Overhauling the tax code? Investing more money in job-creating infrastructure projects? The awkward answer for Republican lawmakers and Trump is “not much.” Despite having control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives since the November 2016 elections, Republicans have not delivered on their biggest campaign promises. Distracted by a probe of possible ties between his campaign and Russian meddling in the election, among many other issues he tweets about, Trump has yet to propose any major legislation since his Jan. 20 inauguration. Some Republicans fear voters will punish their party in the November 2018 elections for inaction now, and that congressional losses would make it even harder for Trump to get things done in 2019-2020, the second half of his four-year term. Republicans’ failure to repeal Obamacare “is going to be difficult to explain to the (Republican) base,” former Senate Majority Tom Daschle, a Democrat, said in a recent interview.   There are some achievements for Republicans to point to, including the Senate confirmation in April of Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, conservative judge Neil Gorsuch. This week, congressional Democrats and Republicans also pressured Trump into enacting a Russia-Iran-North Korea sanctions bill. Lawmakers also managed to pass bills to improve veterans’ healthcare and renew a Food and Drug Administration funding stream for reviewing drug safety. The Senate confirmed a new FBI director and Congress also repealed 14 Obama-era regulations. But as Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina told reporters, he and his fellow Republicans “lack traction” on major legislation. “We have not done well on the big events.” When Congress returns in early September, Republicans want to focus on taxes. But a comprehensive tax reform initiative remains under wraps amid deep divisions in the party. There has been no movement on legislation to finance the rebuilding of roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure. Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who faces a possible tough re-election next year, said Trump remains popular among voters in her state, which he carried by 36 points in November. “They’re grateful for the rollback of what we all considered onerous regulations against industry; onerous overreach by EPA (Environmental Protection Agency),” Heitkamp said of the regulations then-President Barack Obama imposed before leaving office, which Trump and Congress nullified. Republicans want to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1, an action that was supposed to have been taken care of long before the summer recess. Without the measure, Republican legislation rewriting the U.S. tax code might not advance. There are serious disagreements among Republicans about long-term spending levels, however. Also ominous are the party’s rifts over funding the government near-term and avoiding Oct. 1 federal agency shutdowns. And there is the problem of raising Washington’s borrowing limit. Failure could trigger a historic U.S. default. Those and other issues will be taken up next month. But in the run-up to the summer break the Senate did manage to close ranks and unanimously pass a resolution proclaiming Sept. 25 as National Lobster Day. ",1
" One way or another, she s going to have to face these charges    Former Republican Congressman Tom Delay Note that Tom Delay says the  FBI is ready to indict . The FBI cannot indict but the DOJ can indict. If the DOJ chooses not to indict, Hillary will be tried in the court of public opinion. This will be an interesting test for DOJ Director Loretta Lynch.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday he will present to President Donald Trump a range of options to restrict  steel imports on national security grounds, according to senators who met with Ross. Senator Sherrod Brown said that Ross “pretty much committed” to announcing these options next week as part of Commerce’s review of whether steel imports are threatening U.S. national security under a 1962 trade law. But Ross, speaking to reporters following a closed-door meeting with Senate Finance Committee members, declined to put a time frame on the review’s release. “It’ll come out when it’s ready to come out,” he said. The 79-year-old former steel industry magnate said he spoke to senators about the broad outlines of the “Section 232” probe, including its legal basis and objectives, “the potential tools for accomplishing those objectives, what are the risks involved in the process.” Ross did not provide any details on specific recommendations to Trump, saying the purpose of the meeting was to provide senators “with some background within which they can judge their reaction to the report when it comes out.” Trump told reporters on his flight to France that he was considering both tariffs and quotas to stop foreign countries from dumping steel into the U.S. market and “destroying” the U.S. steel industry. The release of his remarks sent steel stocks soaring on Thursday. “The options are everything,” said Brown, a Democrat from a major steel-producing state. “I pushed him to move quickly on this. I want it to be strong. I want it to be long lasting, and I want it to address the overhanging issue of Chinese steel overcapacity.” While steelmakers and workers argue that protections are needed to put the industry on a healthy footing, steel users say that import curbs would raise steel prices, putting them at a disadvantage to foreign competitors. Senator Ron Wyden, the Finance Committee’s top Democrat, said some members tried to convey to Ross that using the Cold War-era trade law to restrict imports of steel on defense grounds was “not an enduring solution” to the steel production glut.   “The secretary feels confident that his approach is going to make all sides happy in the steel industry,” Wyden said.     In 2001, Commerce investigated the national security impact of iron ore and semifinished steel imports but recommended no action. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Al Franken faced intense pressure from members of his own party on Wednesday to resign from the U.S. Senate over accusations of sexual misconduct. Minnesota Public Radio reported Franken would resign on Thursday. Franken’s office said in an email that no final decision had been made and that the senator was still discussing the issue with his family. After accusations began surfacing three weeks ago, Franken  said he would remain in office and work to regain the trust of voters in Minnesota, the state he represents.  But on Wednesday, calls for him to resign came from the majority of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate, including Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and almost all of the Democratic women in the chamber, putting great pressure on him to quit. “I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,” Schumer said in a statement. Franken said on Twitter that he would make an announcement on Thursday, but he offered no details. In its report, Minnesota Public Radio cited a Democratic official who had spoken to the senator and aides. Late on Wednesday, news website Politico reported that Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton was expected to appoint Democratic Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith to take Franken’s seat if he resigned. She would hold the seat until a special election in 2018. That move would leave the Minnesota race wide open because Smith would not run in the special election to finish Franken’s term, which goes through 2020, Politico said, citing people familiar with Dayton’s thinking.  Franken is one of a number of prominent American men in politics, media and entertainment who have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct. Another accusation against Franken surfaced on Wednesday when Politico reported that a congressional aide said Franken had tried to forcibly kiss her in 2006, before he was first elected as a senator. Franken denied the allegations, Politico reported. Franken’s office did not reply to a request for comment on the report. The calls on Wednesday marked the first time Franken’s Democratic colleagues had publicly pressed for him to step down since the accusations surfaced. The party’s chairman, Tom Perez, also pressed for him to resign. Schumer called Franken immediately after the Politico story was published and told him that he needed to relinquish his Senate seat, according to a person familiar with the situation. “I’ve struggled with this decision because he’s been a good senator and I consider him a friend,” Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii wrote on Twitter. “But that cannot excuse his behavior and his mistreatment of women.” Franken apologized for his behavior after earlier accusations and said he would cooperate with a Senate Ethics Committee investigation. Reuters has not independently verified the claims against him. Democrats are seeking the moral high ground in the wake of sexual misconduct accusations against numerous public figures, including Republican Roy Moore of Alabama, who is running for the Senate, and Democratic Representative John Conyers, who resigned on Tuesday. Both of those men have denied the accusations against them. Several Republican lawmakers initially called on Moore to step out of the race, but have since said the decision is ultimately up to Alabama voters. President Donald Trump has endorsed the candidate. The election is Tuesday. Franken, a former comedian who rose to national prominence as a cast member on the long-running television program “Saturday Night Live,” had been considered a rising star in the Democratic party since he was first elected in 2008. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who was among those saying Franken should resign, told reporters that Democrats had been “having conversations” about Franken for a while. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell joined the groundswell against Franken, saying in a statement, “I do not believe he can effectively serve the people of Minnesota in the U.S. Senate any longer.” Franken’s Minnesota colleague, Senator Amy Klobuchar, wrote on Twitter, “Sexual harassment is unacceptable. This morning I spoke with Senator Franken and, as you know, he will be making an announcement about his future tomorrow morning. I am confident he will make the right decision.”  ",1
"After Donald Trump s Saturday morning tweetstorm, we have no choice but to wonder what, exactly, he is worried about. Ever since the  pee pee dossier  was originally released, we have seen Trump s ravings evolve from complaints about  FAKE NEWS  to demands that the  ILLEGAL LEAKS  stop. On Saturday, The Donald expanded on his at times incomprehensible ravings by blaming Obama for people learning about his and his campaign s illicit activities involving Russian oligarchs.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017This isn t McCarthyism. While Trump did not provide any evidence of his claim, it was well known by intelligence agencies rather early in 2016. Trump even publicly asked the dictator of a hostile foreign power to hack his political opponents. It s only natural for our intelligence agencies to want to look into that.Saying nothing of the evidence that has been uncovered that his team kept in constant contact with high-ranking Russian officials during the campaign, Trump demanded to know if it is legal for our intelligence agencies to investigate someone who is openly colluding with Vladimir Putin against the interests of the American people:Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Then, he threatened to go after President Obama in court because our intelligence agencies did their jobs:I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump didn t quite explain his next tweet, but he is more right than he knows about part of it.  How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  President Asterisk whined.This is, indeed, very much like Nixon/Watergate in that Nixon was guilty and did quite a bit of public flailing before the investigation into his crimes was complete. But it seems that Trump was saying that Nixon, like himself, was innocent and that President Obama was  sick  for allegedly authorizing wiretaps against such a pristine example of a human being as Trump.Naturally, Americans were all over this one:.@Mike_P_Williams this is truly staggering.

Raoul Binderschmidt (@Skeletor_Jesus) March 4, 2017Ironically, last year it was revealed that Trump had a special console next to his bed at the Mar-A-Lago that allowed him to spy on guests  phone conversations. Though Trump denied it, numerous former staffers confirmed that the billionaire did, indeed, spy on guests. Unlike the possibility that our intelligence agencies did  tapp  Trump s phone during the campaign   with good reason   this would be a crime. It is illegal in Florida to intercept or record phone calls without the consent of everyone involved in the conversation.Hopefully, Trump is right that this is like Nixon/Watergate. We all know how that ended.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)/screengrab",0
"MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Two staff members of a Kenyan university were killed south of Mombasa on Tuesday when gunmen fired on vehicles carrying them and students to their campus, the area police chief said.  The identity of the gunmen was unclear. Police in the coastal county of Kwale, where the Technical University of Mombasa (TUM) has a campus, said they could be robbers or militants. Security is poor in the area and the convoy had a police escort. Somali Islamist militants al Shabaab frequently carry out attacks along the Kenyan coast and have been recruiting new members there. In 2015, al Shabaab gunmen killed 148 students at a university in Kenya s Garissa town near the Kenya-Somali border, an attack that provoked shock and outrage in Kenya and abroad.  Two staff members of the university were killed Tuesday s attack, and a driver and two policemen were wounded, area police chief Joseph Chebusit told Reuters.   A bus carrying students of TUM was ferrying them from their hostels to the campus in Ukunda for classes and was being escorted by a van that had some staff of the college and two escort police officers,  the policeman said.   Armed men numbering about 10 emerged from the bushes and started firing at the van in front. As a result two ladies who are staff of TUM were killed in the van. The driver of the van and two police officers were injured,  he said.    We have information that the attackers had other accomplices along the road who were monitoring the movement of the two vehicles and communicating with them to enable the attack,  he added.   For now we are treating it as a crime like any other as we continue with investigations but that does not mean we are ruling out al Shabaab.  A witness who did not want to be named told Reuters she and several other students had fled their vehicle when gunmen opened fire on them and had seen several students covered in blood.  But Chebusit said no students were injured.  ",1
"Donald Trump is all about free speech, as long as it means that he can verbally abuse anyone who gets in his way without having to pay consequences. Unfortunately, for Trump, though, the media, whose job it is to vet presidential candidates, isn t always sympathetic to his verbal tirades and his twitterrhea. He wants to put a stop to that.In an interview with Miami s WFOR, Trump was asked by the reporter if it should be easier to sue media and whether the First Amendment provides  too much protection. Trump didn t specifically say  yes,  but he did talk about England.Well in England they have a system where you can actually sue if someone says something wrong. Our press is allowed to say whatever they want and get away with it. And i think we should go to a system where if they do something wrong  I m a big believer tremendous believer of the freedom of the press. Nobody believes it stronger than me but if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people. I m not just talking about me I m talking anybody else then yes, i think you should have the ability to sue them.Here s the video:Let s recap that for a moment. Trump says,  if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people. I m not just talking about me I m talking anybody else then yes, i think you should have the ability to sue them. We already have that system in place. Trump literally described libel laws. Unfortunately for him, though, public figures, especially those running for public office, have a much harder time winning a libel suit, although if a publication knowingly writes incorrect and damaging information, he can sue.The problem for Trump, though, is that the media hasn t lied about him. They quote him directly, which for a man who clearly can t control what comes out of his mouth, is a problem.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",0
"This week s cold open for Saturday Night Live featured a parody of the morning show, Morning Joe. The sketch featured Alex Moffat as host Joe Scarborough and Kate McKinnon as Mika Mika Brzezinski. The sketch also has Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump, who calls into the show as  John Miller,  a spokesperson for the White House. Back in the day, Trump was known for calling reporters all over the New York area pretending to be his own publicist. He would call, not to tout his business successes but to brag about his sex life.The sketch also made fun of the relationship between the hosts. The pair got engaged recently when they were celebrating Mika s 50th birthday.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Wednesday the issue of whether President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign colluded with Russia remains an open question as the panel intensifies its probe into the matter. Republican Chairman Richard Burr and Democratic Vice Chairman Mark Warner also warned about the risk to future U.S. elections posed by Russia, including what is expected to be a closely contested election next month for governor of Warner’s home state, Virginia. Burr told reporters the committee plans to conduct 25 more interviews with witnesses this month, but described his goal of finishing this year the main congressional investigation into Russian meddling as only “aspirational” at this point. “The issue of collusion is still open,” Burr said, standing alongside Warner at a press conference to provide an update on the investigation. “We have not come to any determination on collusion,” he said. Burr said he wanted very much to conclude the investigation before the height of campaigning for November 2018 U.S. mid-term elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and one third of the 100-seat Senate will be up for grabs. Warner said the United States needed a “whole-of-government” approach to combating interference with U.S. elections. “The Russian active measures efforts did not end on Election Day, 2016,” he said.  Trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax, has faced questions about the matter since he took office in January. A special counsel appointed by the Justice Department, Robert Mueller, is conducting a separate probe that could lead to criminal charges. Russia denies meddling. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the election to try to help Trump defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her campaign. Burr said the committee agreed with the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia had interfered. “The committee continues to look into all evidence to see if there was any hint of collusion,” Burr said. “Now, I’m not even going to discuss initial findings because we haven’t any. We’ve got a tremendous amount of documents still to go through.” He said the panel has conducted more than 100 interviews lasting more than 250 hours in its nine-month-old probe, and “we currently have booked for the balance of this month 25 additional interviews.” Those who have already come before committee members or investigators include the president’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and social media executives such as officials from Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).  On Wednesday, a representative for Kushner and Ivanka Trump denied a report in USA Today that the couple had re-routed personal emails through their family’s business. Among witnesses who will appear at future public committee hearings are Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, and executives from Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google. Warner and Burr urged American election officials and political campaigns to take the threat of Russian interference seriously. “You can’t walk away from this and believe that Russia’s not currently active in trying to create chaos in our election process. And I assume that the same tactics that you saw in Montenegro, in France, in Belgium and in the United States will continue to be tested within our structure of the election process,” Burr said. Burr said the committee has “hit a wall” in its investigation of a former British spy’s explosive dossier on purported Russian support for Trump’s 2016 campaign. Former MI6 officer Christopher Steele compiled the dossier, which Trump was told by former FBI director James Comey contained salacious material about the businessman-turned-president. Trump and his associates have called the dossier’s contents false. “We have, on several occasions, made attempts to contact Mr. Steele, to meet with Mr. Steele,” Burr said. “Those offers have gone unaccepted. The committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub-sources,” Burr added.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite President Donald Trump s full-throated support for Saudi Arabia, the United States appears to be signaling a desire for Riyadh to take a more cautious approach in its regional power struggle with Iran, experts say. The Trump administration, which shares Saudi Arabia s view of Iran as a regional menace, has strongly backed the Kingdom in the wake of a failed missile attack from Iran-aligned forces in Yemeni territory that demonstrated an ability to strike the Saudi capital. Trump has cultivated much warmer ties with the Saudis after a fraught relationship with the Obama administration - the president made Riyadh his first stop on his maiden international trip - and has vowed to take strong action to confront Iran. Nevertheless, Washington, which has U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, is telegraphing a more tempered stance toward the confrontation in a region beset with turmoil.  On Thursday, the State Department called for  unimpeded access  for humanitarian aid to Yemen, after Saudi Arabia imposed a blockade on the country to stem the flow of arms to Iran-aligned Houthi fighters.  A day later, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made clear he still recognized as Lebanon s prime minister Saad al-Hariri, who unexpectedly announced his resignation on Nov. 4 from Riyadh. In announcing his decision on television, Hariri said he feared assassination and accused Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world, thrusting Lebanon into the front line of the competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran.  Two U.S. officials said the Saudis, led by Crown Prince Mohammed, had  encouraged  Hariri to leave office and Lebanese officials say he is being held in Saudi Arabia, a charge Riyadh denies. Hariri has not commented publicly on whether he is free to come and go as he pleases. In a statement on Saturday, the White House said it  rejects any efforts by militias within Lebanon or by any foreign forces to threaten Lebanon s stability...or use Lebanon as a base from which to threaten others in the region.  When asked to comment on whether the United States was pushing for a more cautious Saudi response, both the White House and State Department referred to Saturday s statement on Lebanon. Tillerson was  not going along with the Saudi position in describing the Lebanese state as under capture by Hezbollah,   said Paul Salem, the senior vice president of the Middle East Institute, a Washington think tank.  That s significant.   Tillerson was also  signaling to the Israelis ... that now is not the time to go after Lebanon,  said Salem, referring to long-standing Israeli concerns about Hezbollah s growing military prowess. Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he believed the Trump administration was still seeking to help the Saudis advance their interests against Iran without destabilizing the region.  This is a delicate balancing act. It involves supporting allies in a policy that the administration agrees with, while trying to mitigate aspects of it that it (sees as) overstated,  Takeyh said. Tillerson s statement also urged  all parties both within Lebanon and outside  to respect Lebanon s independence and said there was no role for any foreign forces. The United States regularly criticizes Iran and Hezbollah for their role in Lebanon. Tillerson s backing of Hariri and the Lebanese government contrasted sharply with the approach taken by Saudi Arabia, which has lumped Lebanon with Hezbollah as parties hostile to it.  I see Rex Tillerson as being an old fashioned American diplomat and old fashioned American diplomacy in the Middle East is all about stability,  said F. Gregory Gause, chairman of the International Affairs Department at Texas A&M University.  I m not entirely sure that that is the position of the chief executive of the United States,  Gause added. The Saudi actions coincide with an anti-corruption purge by the country s future king that tightened his grip on power. Trump tweeted on Monday that he had  great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia  following the mass arrests - the biggest such purge of the kingdom s affluent elite in its modern history. Trump also tweeted that  they know exactly what they are doing.   Former and current U.S. officials with deep knowledge of Saudi Arabia say Trump s enthusiastic support for Prince Mohammed has emboldened the youthful Saudi leader. Tillerson told reporters the purge appeared  well intended  but the mass arrests, which have swept up officials long known in Washington, also fueled U.S. concerns.  It raises a few concerns until we see more clearly how these particular individuals are dealt with,  Tillerson added. Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the president s senior adviser, who has cultivated a close relationship with Prince Mohammed, recently returned from Saudi Arabia, fueling speculation on whether he may have had wind of the Crown Prince s plans. A senior administration official said they had no advance knowledge. ",1
"This latest move by America s notorious Transportation Security Authority (TSA) seems to be step one in a move towards a national ID Card, complete with biometrics and embedded RFID technology.By forcing residents of nine states to get passports in order to board domestic flights, the TSA is de facto pushing those states towards the implementation of a new state-of-the-art ID card system.This will help to give real teeth to the  The Real ID Act It s just the next phase in the further militarization of US society.Forbes reports You may have thought you don t need a passport because you don t travel outside the United States. But for residents of nine states, that will change at the beginning of 2018 for any commercial flight, whether international or domestic.Nine states will no longer allow travelers to board an airplane with just their state issued driver s licenses as of January 22, 2018. To get past TSA security checkpoints, another form of identification will be required: passport, permanent resident card/green card or a military ID.The Real ID Act of 2005 states that state-issued IDs from these nine states do not meet the minimum security standards of the federal government:With just a few months until the Real ID Act goes into full effect, it is time to start planning now and look into getting your passport. Here is the airport signage, placed around the security checkpoints in airports to remind U.S. travelers of what;s to come (with my emphasis): Starting January 22, 2018, you will need a driver s license or ID from a state compliant with the REAL ID ACT, a state that has an extension for compliance, or an alternate ID to fly. For REAL ID information, and a list of acceptable IDs, visit tsa.gov.  Some states have started working on offering federally approved issued IDs that would not require a passport for domestic air travel. Check with your local government office to see if there is a different type of ID you can apply for, and the TSA website to clarify this situation. Because on January 22, 2018, the enforcement for those nine states will go into effect, and by 2020, even more people will end up needing a passport, as confirmed by the official website of the Transportation Security Administration.To repeat, if you re going to take a flight and you have a state-issued ID from one of those nine states listed above, unless your state has made federally approved changes before January, you should use a passport to go anywhere across the country, as all domestic travel is included in these new standards.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. Republicans said on Sunday they expected Congress to pass a tax code overhaul this week, with a Senate vote as early as Tuesday and President Donald Trump aiming to sign the bill by week’s end. John Cornyn, the No. 2 U.S. Senate Republican, said in an interview on ABC’s “This Week” that he was “confident” the Senate would pass the legislation, “probably on Tuesday.” Republican Representative Kevin Brady said he believed his party had the votes to pass the bill. “I think we are headed - the American people are headed -  for a big win on Tuesday,” Brady, the House of Representatives’  top tax writer, said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.” “We’ve worked hard to make sure that those strange Senate rules don’t hang this up in any way,” Brady added. “I am confident that’s the case.”  If passed, the bill would be the biggest U.S. tax rewrite since 1986 and provide Republican lawmakers and Trump with their first major legislative victory since they took control of the White House in January in addition to Congress. Republicans have a slim 52-48 Senate majority and cannot lose more than two votes and still pass tax legislation. Democrats are unified against the measure, calling it a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit.  Last week, on-the-fence Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker said they would support the tax overhaul. Senators Susan Collins and Mike Lee put out positive statements but did not explicitly say they would vote for it. Collins’ office said on Sunday that “she’s still reviewing the bill.” Republican Senator Jeff Flake cast a vote for an earlier Senate version despite deficit concerns, but he is undecided on the final legislation, his office said on Sunday.  Senators Thad Cochran and John McCain have been ill in recent weeks and have missed votes. Cochran’s office said last week he was expected to vote on the tax bill. McCain, who is battling an aggressive brain tumor, has returned to his home state of Arizona and does not expect to be back in Washington until January, his office said on Sunday. The tax bill is expected to add at least $1 trillion to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt over 10 years, even after accounting for the economic growth it might spur, according to independent government analyses.  The bill would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and create a 20 percent income tax deduction for owners of “pass-through” businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. It would offer a mixed bag for individuals, including middle-class workers, by roughly doubling a standard deduction that does not require itemization, but eliminating or scaling back other popular itemized deductions and exemptions. The bill would maintain seven individual and family income tax brackets but cut rates. Highest-earning Americans would pay 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent.  Most individual provisions, including the lower tax rates, are temporary and would expire, while the corporate rate cut and other business provisions would be permanent. Stock markets have been rallying for months in anticipation of sharply lower tax rates for corporations, with Wall Street’s three major equities indexes closing at record highs on Friday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that Trump expected to realize his goal of signing the tax bill before Christmas. “This is a historic event,” Mnuchin said. “People said we wouldn’t get this done; we’re on the verge of getting this done.”  ",1

"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - For 28-year-old Rohingya Muslim shopkeeper Mohammed Rashid, the evening phone call from organizers of the fledgling insurgent movement came as a surprise.   Be ready,  was the message. A few hours later, after meeting in the darkness in an open field, he was one of 150 men who attacked a Myanmar Border Guard Police post armed with swords, homemade explosives and a few handguns. At the end of a short battle, half a dozen men he had grown up with in his village were dead.  We had no training, no weapons,  said Rashid, from the Buthidaung area of Myanmar s Rakhine state, who had joined the group just two months earlier. Accounts from some of those, like Rashid, who took part in attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on dozens of police posts early on Aug. 25 paint a picture of a rag-tag band of hopeless, angry villagers, who were promised AK-47 rifles but ended up fighting with sticks and knives. Hundreds joined as recently as June, according to the accounts, and membership meant little more than a knife and messages from leaders on the popular mobile messaging app Whatsapp.  Reuters interviewed half a dozen fighters and members of the group now sheltering in Bangladesh, as well as dozens of others among the more than half a million Rohingya refugees who have fled across the border to escape a Myanmar army counteroffensive that the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. ARSA, which emerged in 2016, says in press releases and video messages from its leader, Ata Ullah, that it is fighting for the rights of the Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority that has long complained of persecution in mainly Buddhist Myanmar. Myanmar says ARSA is a ruthless Islamist extremist movement that wants to create an Islamic republic in northern Rakhine. Despite the massive suffering inflicted on their communities in the weeks since the August attacks, most of the fighters now stuck in dirt-poor camps said they were determined to continue their fight and some refugees voiced support for the insurgency. Other refugees Reuters spoke to criticized the insurgents for bringing more misery upon them. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi s spokesman, Zaw Htay, said ARSA had killed many Muslims who had cooperated with the authorities and so  people have felt threatened and terrorized  into supporting it. He added that Myanmar s intelligence showed that religious scholars were prominent in recruiting followers. ARSA denies killing civilians, and did not respond to a request for comment this week. Analysts say the violence could galvanize ARSA members and supporters huddled in the refugee camps and among those Rohingya still in Myanmar, as people feel they have even less to lose.  A militancy like this finds fertile ground because of the desperation of the community,  said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based analyst and former U.N. official.  They are willing to take suicidal steps because they don t see any other choice.  Transnational Islamist groups could also try to exploit the desperation in the camps to radicalize people, Horsey added. Al Qaeda last month called for support for the Rohingya. Reuters could not independently verify the individual insurgents  stories, but there were broad similarities in all of their accounts. One fighter, 35-year-old Kamal Hussain from a village in Rathedaung in Myanmar s Rakhine state, said he joined ARSA when a religious teacher stood in his village square in June, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and implored a crowd of hundreds to fight.   He said we have no choice but to attack Myanmar because our brothers and sisters are being killed day by day. I think everyone joined that day,  Hussain said, as he sat under a tarpaulin in a Bangladesh refugee camp.  We should attack again and again. I would go back to fight if I had the chance.  Unlike longer-serving fighters, most new joiners had little or no training or contact with the group s leaders, who communicated using Whatsapp and delivered rudimentary homemade explosives ahead of the assaults. A third fighter, his account supported by comments from two elders from his village interviewed separately, said he and about 60 men from Myin Hlut signed up three months ago.  The 26-year-old, who asked not to be named because he feared arrest by Bangladeshi authorities, said he was among 200 men who attacked another police checkpost in the early hours of Aug. 25.  We had only knives and sticks, no guns,  he said.  They promised us AK-47s but we got nothing. The explosives didn t work. We had two of them for the whole group, but when we threw them nothing happened.  About 40 fighters were killed, he said, but added that he would do it again if called on.  I still support ARSA,  he said.  If my leaders call me to go again and fight, I will go back.  According to two village-level commanders, there were Whatsapp groups restricted to leaders and others to members. Bigger groups, administered from overseas, were used to build broader community support for ARSA and the Rohingya cause.  On his phone, Shoket Ullah, an uncle of the 26-year-old fighter, scrolled through messages posted in the Whatsapp group  ARSA.G1 , administered through a Saudi phone number, where ARSA press releases, videos of alleged Myanmar military violence and messages of support for Rohingyas were shared. Another Whatsapp group on Ullah s phone,  Rohingya Desh Arakan , is administered by someone using a number from Malaysia. Tens of thousands of Rohingya live in both Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Rohingya anger at Myanmar has long existed, but this is the first serious armed resistance in decades.  In the crowded Bangladeshi camps, several refugees voice support for ARSA.  I am disappointed and regret what happened but this was pre-planned by the Myanmar government,  said Shafi Rahman, a 45-year-old Burmese teacher whose village was burned to the ground the day after the attacks.  If ARSA didn t attack, they would have done this to us anyway.  Several refugees said some people had begun to sell cattle, vegetables and rice to raise funds for ARSA. Not everyone was supportive, however. When Kamal Hussain, the fighter, argued that ARSA needed to keep fighting, his neighbors in the camp shouted him down.  We have lost everything. Violence is not the answer,  shouted one elderly man, as muddy water spilled into the tent he now calls home.    It is not obvious how fighters would regroup and rebuild after so many have fled across the border or disappeared.  Three of the fighters who spoke to Reuters said they had been surprised by the ferocity of the Myanmar military s response, and within weeks commanders had told their men to put down their weapons and abandon their villages. Several said Whatsapp groups where regional and field commanders from ARSA, which before a rebranding this year called itself al-Yakin, or  Faith Movement , would post updates had gone quiet.   People who blame this on al-Yakin need to realize my people had to flee in 1978 and in the 1990s when there was no ARSA,  said one of the two village-level commanders, who grew up in Bangladesh after his family fled an earlier outbreak of violence, but returned to Myanmar in the 1990s.  We should continue to attack. Even women can join.  ",1
"When will Americans stop being afraid of standing up to leftist agitators and tell them,  NO!  When will Americans find a backbone and stop allowing the left to dictate what they re allowed to say or to feel? Why are white Americans allowing themselves and law enforcement officers of every race and ethnicity to be thrown under the bus, because we re led by the radical left to believe that it will somehow make us better people.Oddly, sports channels have decided to assume the role of America s social conscience. Sports used to be a unifying force for Americans, a place for perfect strangers to come together and bond over their love and support for a particular team. The Disney owned ESPN sports network has been working very hard to change that.Fear and intimidation are two of the tools the Left uses in order to make people comply with their message of unity through division. And according to one TV and radio sports host, these tactics are beginning to take hold in the NFL.Fox Sports 1 host Jason Whitlock joined Tucker Carlson Monday evening on Fox News   Tucker Carlson Tonight  to talk about the state of protesting during the National Anthem in the NFL.Whitlock understands that protesting is perfectly within players  rights as Americans, but he takes issue with the method in which people like unemployed quarterback Colin Kaepernick go about protesting. There are NFL players, black and white, who know that if you really want to address police brutality, social justice, inequality in this country, protesting the National Anthem is the perfect way for your message to get completely lost,  Whitlock told Carlson.NFL players have so many platforms on which to voice their approval or displeasure on whatever issue they re championing this week. But to use the National Anthem as the vehicle for their message only causes their message fall flat in the eyes of a lot of football fans. These  silent protests  don t make them look heroic, but rather selfish.Whitlock also posed an interesting theory to Carlson concerning players who aren t participating in these social justice protests. I want to know why NFL players aren t offering voices of dissent?  Whitlock asked. You can t tell me that there aren t NFL players who recognize the stupidity of the style of protest Colin Kaepernick has chosen,  Whitlock said.  But they re all afraid to say it because of the backlash. Another good point.We have seen sports entities like the NFL and ESPN become bastions of social justice promotion in an age where people are being divided into more groups than the  Divergent  series.

"On Saturday, Donald Trump tweeted a dire warning about Iran test-firing a missile, and proclaiming that the country was  working with North Korea,  whatever that means. The tweet was easy to overlook, since it was part of a litany of unhinged rants about Obamacare, Alabama s special election, a basketball player, the National Football League, and his idea of patriotism.Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Literally 21 minutes later, Trump was back to talking about repealing healthcare for millions of Americans and calling John McCain a coward, and 5 minutes after that, Trump was back to the NFL. Like I said, I don t blame you if you missed it.Thankfully, the tweet is still there. That could come in handy, should anyone decide to do anything about the fact that he was either lying or a complete moron. Or even more disturbingly, that the President of the United States is using fake video to start a war with Iran. Or perhaps Donald Trump simply didn t recognize the exact same footage that he put Iran  on notice  for at the beginning of February:Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017Fox News, the President s very favorite for of media, is now reporting that the  missile launch  that Trump was referring to on Saturday was in fact video from a launch in January. There was no missile fired on Saturday   Iranian media was simply showing what the missile they included in a parade that day was capable of.Conducting international affairs via social media is nothing new for Donald Trump. It was scarcely hours before he had casually threatened North Korea with total nuclear annihilation via Twitter. By tomorrow, the US may find itself embroiled in World War Three if someone doesn t take that idiot s cell phone away from him.Sadly, nothing would make Trump happier than a new conflict, since wartime presidents are far more popular and important than those who govern peacefully over periods of expansion and global goodwill.That s what war would mean to Donald Trump: Ratings.Featured image via Majid/Getty Images",0
"Former  Baywatch  star Pamela Anderson tried to use her charms to get past the Secret Service to meet with Vice President Mike Pence. She wanted to speak with Pence about a pardon for Julian Assange of Wikileaks. Anderson has been connected to Assange romantically and reportedly visits him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. She s also become more politically active in recent years because of her awareness of Assange s plight.Page Six reports:Spies tell Page Six that Anderson was in Manhattan filming a PSA at the JW Marriott Essex House when she learned that Pence was at the same address. The blond bombshell has said that she  loves  WikiLeaks founder Assange and visits him every two weeks in his  cramped  room at London s Ecuadorian embassy, where he s staying in order to evade extradition.According to onlookers, Anderson  marched straight up to the Secret Service and asked to see Pence. A witness said:  The Secret Service agent practically swooned and fainted when she walked up to him and started pressing her finger on his badge. Pam said,  I d like to meet the vice president.  But, the source added,  The agent did get it together enough to politely refuse, saying the vice president was busy. Pamela Anderson s attempt to woo the Secret Service was unsuccessful.When we reached activist Anderson for comment, she confirmed to Page Six:  I wanted to thank [Pence] for supporting protection of sources for journalists. He is heralded for co-sponsoring proposals for a  federal shield law,  which I deeply admire. This action would have allowed journalists to keep confidential sources secret   even if the government requested them.  She added,  I really wanted to mention this   it is a topic close to my heart. Julian Assange deserves a pardon, and I thought I might be able to help. Julian is a hero to most of the world s youth and free-minded thinking people.

"At this point, Donald Trump is known for his spelling errors on Twitter and, well, in general. Not a day goes by that The Donald isn t forced to delete a tweet that looks more like a kindergartener wrote it than normal, tweets in which he calls Hillary Clinton a  loose cannon  with bad instincts  and  bad judgement.  But on Saturday, he made an  unpresidented  error and literally got smacked down by the dictionary.Tweeting about China s seizure of a U.S. underwater drone   a brash action taken shortly after The Donald created an international incident by chatting with the President of Taiwan and Twitter-trolling China. Since that call, Chinese state-run media has been calling for their nation to  recover Taiwan by force    an obvious consequence of Trump s extremely lackluster foreign policy skills. The Wall Street Journal reports:The incident on Thursday occurred days after President-elect Donald J. Trump raised China s ire by suggesting his administration could abandon a bedrock agreement on Taiwan s status that has kept peace in the area for decades. Mr. Trump s suggestion that the U.S. would maintain its position on Taiwan only if China makes concessions to American interests came after he broke decades of diplomatic protocol by accepting a phone call from Taiwan s president, hitting one of Beijing s most sensitive issues.

"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities have issued detention warrants for 216 people, including former finance ministry personnel, suspected of having links to last year s failed coup attempt, the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Wednesday. It said 17 former finance ministry personnel had been detained so far and another 65 were sought over alleged links to Gulen s network, Anadolu said.  Separately, authorities carried out operations across 40 provinces targeting  private imams  believed to be recruiting members to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen from Turkey s armed forces. Ankara blames Gulen for orchestrating the July 15 coup attempt last year and has repeatedly demanded the United States extradite him, so far in vain. Gulen denies involvement. In the aftermath of the coup, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sector. The extent of the purges has unnerved rights groups and Turkey s Western allies, who fear President Tayyip Erdogan is using the abortive putsch as a pretext to stifle dissent. The government, however, says the measures are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it is facing following the military coup attempt, in which 240 people were killed. ",1
"NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Flaring tempers and sharp elbows may turn a debate among seven Republican presidential candidates into a seven-car pileup on Thursday with tensions between Donald Trump and rival Ted Cruz leading the way. The sixth Republican debate, at the North Charleston Coliseum in the swing state of South Carolina, takes place at a tense time for the Republican field with the clock ticking toward Feb. 1 in Iowa, the first contest in the race to choose the party’s nominee for the Nov. 8 general election. The 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT Friday) debate features the top seven candidates ranked by Republican voters: New York real estate businessman and reality TV star Trump, Texas Senator Cruz, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Ohio Governor John Kasich.  Nearly every candidate has had a bone to pick with one or more of the others this week. Beyond the Trump-Cruz theatrics, Bush has blasted Trump and Rubio, Rubio has slammed Bush as well as Cruz and Christie, and Christie has attacked most everyone else. “Given all the attacks that are taking place and the counterattacks, I think it will be a more lively debate than we’ve seen at this point,” said Eric Fehrnstrom, who was a top adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. “Donald Trump is still in complete command and the race is still about who will become his main challenger.” In an earlier debate of low-polling candidates, Republicans Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum largely focused their criticism on Democrats rather than each other.  They were all in agreement that President Barack Obama’s strategy toward Iran, the fight against Islamic State and his executive orders last week to strengthen gun control were flawed and should be changed. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who was demoted from the main stage because of faltering poll numbers, dominated the so-called “undercard” debate with a series of one-line zingers, one of them aimed at Democrat Hillary Clinton over her prior marital strains with Bill Clinton, the former president. “Unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband,” said Fiorina. U.S. Senator Paul Rand of Kentucky opted out of the “undercard debate” and said instead he would host a town hall session on Twitter during the main debate. Front-runner Trump has put Cruz, his main obstacle to an Iowa victory, on the defensive by suggesting Cruz may not qualify to be a candidate because he was born in Canada (to a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban father). This was a change in posture by Trump on the issue, however, after saying in an interview with ABC News last September that he had heard that lawyers believed it was not a problem for Cruz. Trump and Cruz have been friendly over the past year, until now. Being targeted by Trump is a new position for Cruz, who has taken the lead in some polls of Iowa Republican voters in part by avoiding tangles with Trump. In the Reuters rolling national poll on Jan. 12, Trump had 39 percent of the vote, Cruz 14.5 percent, Bush 10.6 percent, Carson 9.6 percent and 6.7 percent favored Rubio, once viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as a rising star. Cruz told reporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday that Trump is relying on a judgment on the birthright question from Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, who Cruz described as “a liberal, left-wing, judicial-activist” and a supporter of Democratic Party front-runner Hillary Clinton. “The past couple of elections we saw the Democrats thrilled that they got the nominee they wanted to run against in the general election, and it seems the Hillary folks are very eager to support Donald Trump,” Cruz said. Trump, who has proved to be a master at finding a perceived weakness in an opponent, insisted Cruz’s Canadian birth violated the U.S. Constitution’s requirement that only “natural born citizens” can be president. “Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!” he tweeted on Wednesday. Mudslinging abounds elsewhere in the field as a grouping of other candidates fight to be the alternative to Trump with battles over national security and immigration.

" (This October 24 story has been refiled to say “go” instead of “do” in second paragraph) By Roberta Rampton LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday trolled Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump - known for his prolific use of Twitter to settle scores - making Trump the punch line for jokes on ABC’s late-night show “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” Obama read aloud a series of “mean tweets” culminating in one from Trump: “President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!” “At least I will go down as a president,” Obama said. Kimmel joked that Obama had to “take time away from helping rig the election” to appear on the show, a dig at Trump, who has repeatedly said the Nov. 8 vote is rigged against him. Obama picked up on the joke while describing how comedian Bill Murray beat him in a contest to putt golf balls into a glass in the Oval Office during a recent visit - a stunt the White House designed to promote Obamacare health insurance. “He won repeatedly,” Obama said. “The glass was rigged!” Kimmel asked Obama, “Do you ever laugh” when watching Trump on television. “Most of the time,” Obama said. Obama also revealed he has been called on a special phone by his bed “three or four times” in the middle of the night during his time in office to deal with emergencies, including when the 2011 tsunami hit Japan. But he said he does not reach for his smartphone in the wee hours - another dig at the Republican candidate. “I don’t tweet at 3 a.m. about people who insult me,” Obama said. Obama’s second and final term ends on Jan. 20. Under the U.S. constitution, presidents are limited to two terms - which is just as well, Obama said. “If I were able to run for a third term, Michelle would divorce me,” he said, noting his wife does not like politics. Not all the jokes were at Trump’s expense. Comedian Will Farrell channeled deceased but beloved Chicago Cubs sportscaster Harry Caray to recommend that Obama “open a shrimp shack” after he leaves office. And Joel McHale feigned outrage when told he had been bumped from the show for Obama. “You got the president, huh. Wow, that’s a big deal - he’s got two months left in the job,” McHale said, oozing sarcasm. “That’s a real good get there, Jimmy: Lame! Duck!” McHale said. ",1
"Rather than just wish America a happy Easter and move on, Donald Trump spent Sunday morning whining about the Tax March protesters.Tax season gave Americans across the country the perfect opportunity to target Trump and his refusal to release his tax returns.During the campaign, Trump promised he would release his returns after the election but quickly rescinded that promise because it s clear his tax returns include many things he wants to hide, including his ties to Russia.So protests broke out over the weekend demanding that Trump finally release his taxes.His response was to complain about how he shouldn t have to release his taxes since he  won  the Electoral College.

"The number of law enforcement officials killed by gunfire is up 150% this year. In an effort to pander for the black vote, Hillary says she would like our police officers to be  retrained.  She ignores the fact that so many families of law enforcement officers have lost a father or mother, husband or wife to criminals. Hillary would like to instead, ensure the gangbangers who are likely using guns they obtained illegally are protected from our law enforcement. Hillary Clinton spent her Sunday in New York campaigning in front of black congregations during which she continued to reiterate her support for retraining police officers.Clinton has made  police reform  a recurring theme in her bid for the Democratic nomination. She was endorsed Sunday by Nicole Bell, wife of Sean Bell, a man who was killed by the NYPD in 2005. No officers were found guilty of any wrongdoing in the incident. Today, I was endorsed by this beautiful young woman, Nicole Bell, whose fianc  was killed by the police right before she was to be married. When I was a Senator, I tried to help. I tried to stand up about what had happened,  the former secretary of state said at the Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Clinton Hill, NY.Clinton added,  today she wrote an editorial in The Daily News endorsing me and she said we have three common goals, she and I together, we have to end the epidemic of gun violence. Bell didn t write an op-ed Sunday, but in an interview with The New York Daily News she said,  [Hillary s] against racial profiling. And she wants to make investments to improve training for police officers. Those issues hit home for me and my family. Hillary repeated these comments almost verbatim at her church visit saying,  We have to end racial profiling and we have to retrain our police officers so they can do a job that doesn t require reaching for their gun when it is absolutely unnecessary.

"Our good friend Brian Pannebecker is a tireless advocate of right-to-work in America and was instrumental in the fight to pass the wildly unpopular law in our very blue state of Michigan. We ve always admired his courage to stand up to union thugs who have done everything in their power to shut down his opposition to the Leftist, Democrat supporting unions. Brian penned this awesome letter to the Detroit Free Press. We d like to share it with you here:As a blue-collar worker in a UAW-represented plant, I m seeing an enthusiasm for a Republican candidate that I have not seen in the 20 years that I have worked at Ford Motor Co. There s a lot of talk about who will win the labor vote this season. But we have to ask, just who does the term  labor  actually represent when it is used today?In the 21st Century, labor unions increasingly represent college educated workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2015 nearly half of all union members worked for the government. Public sector workers (those paid with your tax dollars) are almost five times more likely to belong to a union than private sector workers. And while unionized workers in Michigan can now refuse to pay union dues, even while working under the terms of a negotiated contract thanks to Right to Work, many feel intimidated and are afraid to exercise that right due to veiled threats from union bosses and some coworkers.The support that Donald Trump has from union families and blue collar workers may be surprising to some. Two polls cited in the Free Press recently showed that 30% of those who said there is a union member in their household plan to vote for Trump. But you have to look beyond measures of union-represented workers. Today, many blue-collar workers, including some represented by unions that have endorsed Hillary Clinton, are looking to Donald Trump s candidacy to return the power to them, and bring jobs back to America that left after bad trade deals, including NAFTA.In an online poll conducted for Bloomberg News, 55% of whites with no more than a high school degree, said they support Trump. In my plant, there are a lot of people who are saying  I m voting for Trump and I m not ashamed of it. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has supported NAFTA and the TPP in the past, while Donald Trump has promised to re-negotiate NAFTA and to oppose the TPP. Union members like that kind of talk, and that s why so many of them are breaking with their union bosses to support Donald Trump.Brian PannebeckerFORD Assembly Line Worker, MI",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Health Secretary Tom Price’s use of private jets for government travel was under investigation on Friday after an internal watchdog agreed to review the issue following calls by Democrats for a probe. Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel Levinson’s office said it would request Price’s travel records and seek to review their justification. Price has taken at least two dozen such charter flights since May at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of about $300,000, according to Politico, which first reported the travel. HHS’s Office of the Inspector General “is conducting a review of Secretary Price’s federal travel using chartered aircraft. The review focuses on whether the travel complied with Federal Travel Regulations, but may encompass other issues related to the travel,” said Levinson’s spokeswoman, Tesia Williams, adding that it would be finished as soon as possible. The move comes after House Democratic lawmakers called for the internal review earlier this week. [nL2N1M203S] Separately, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform’s top Democrat, U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, also asked Price for details on the flights and called on panel chairman Trey Gowdy to hold an immediate hearing on the issue. Representatives for Price did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation, earlier reported by the Washington Post and NBC News.  HHS spokeswoman Charmaine Yoest defended Price’s travels, telling the Post: “This is Secretary Price, getting outside of D.C., making sure he is connected with the real American people” and adding that commercial flights could have lengthy delays or force him to miss public events.  In a letter to Price, Cummings asked the secretary for details on the number of flights, the full costs and any documentation about their purpose by Oct. 10. “If these reports are accurate, this would be a stunning and hypocritical breach of trust given that the Trump Administration ... is trying to take away health care from millions of Americans and is proposing to slash funding at HHS,” he wrote.   As a U.S. lawmaker in 2009, Price chastised “the fiscal irresponsibility” of government private plane use in an appearance on CNBC that he also posted on Twitter at the time. Questions over Price’s charter flights come as another top U.S. official, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, is facing scrutiny over his use of a government plane to fly to Kentucky for a visit to Louisville and Fort Knox. Mnuchin and his wife viewed the solar eclipse during the trip, which was to an area of the country that experienced the full eclipse. [nL2N1LI0YD] ",1

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has neither a clear White House tax plan nor adequate staff yet to see through a planned tax reform, according to interviews with people in the administration, in Congress and among U.S. tax experts. In an echo of its attempt to roll back Obamacare that ended in an embarrassing collapse in Congress, the Trump administration has vowed quick action on taxes. But it has yet to appoint people with the skills to evaluate complex tax laws, draft legislation and sell it to deeply divided lawmakers. Burned by last week’s failed healthcare measure largely authored by House of Representatives Republicans, Trump is determined not to count on Congress so much this time for handling the details on taxes, his second major legislative initiative. But that only underscores his need for a strong White House tax team, which the administration still lacks. Many policy options are still being studied, from deficit-funded tax cuts to a European-style value-added tax. “They’re still sorting out who’s in charge, who’s going to take the lead,” said William Hoagland, a longtime Senate Republican aide who worked on the last successful comprehensive tax reform effort in 1986. “You need someone who has the ear and support of the president who can sell a tax plan, and you need the technical support for that person,” said Hoagland, now senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank. Financial markets have been reassessing expectations of fast action on taxes that have helped fuel a Trump stocks rally. Members of Trump’s tax team are known, but not their exact duties. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn are senior team leaders. Others include White House advisers Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Trump huddled with Mnuchin on Thursday to discuss taxes. “We are at the first stages of this process, beginning to engage with members of Congress, policy groups, business leaders, industry, constituents from around the country, and other stakeholders,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday, Trump’s 69th day in office. When Trump was elected in November, Republican lawmakers enthusiastically joined his call to rewrite the tax code and dismantle Obamacare in the first 100 days of his presidency. In early February, Trump promised a “phenomenal” tax plan by early March that never appeared. Mnuchin spoke on Feb. 23 of enacting tax reform by August. Spicer acknowledged this week that the timetable could be slipping.     Another senior White House official said the administration had assumed it would still be working on healthcare at this point, not tax reform yet. The official, not authorized to speak publicly, spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. So far, Trump’s tax campaign is a far cry from President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 effort, in which Don Regan, as Treasury secretary and then White House chief of staff, spent many months developing legislation that won bipartisan support in Congress. “The process under Reagan was much more developed, elaborate and long, and there was a strong bench of top-rate technicians putting things together,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a think tank.   Under Trump, he said, “None of that is happening.” During the 2016 election campaign, Trump issued a tax plan that partly resembled one developed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, but Trump does not now appear wedded to either. It is a safe bet he will not lean heavily on the plan from Ryan, who drafted and championed the ill-fated plan to gut Obamacare. “Trump now desperately needs a policy victory ... I would expect the president to play a much more activist role,” said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a think tank. Moore helped write the Trump campaign tax plan. Mnuchin last week talked about a middle-class tax cut. He also said tax reform in many ways would be “a lot simpler” than healthcare, dismaying tax experts who said that is not so. Comprehensive tax reform is so complex that it has defied Congresses and presidents since Reagan. Tax law is riddled with loopholes embedded in the economy and defended by beneficiaries. Some fundamental questions remain unanswered within the Trump team. For instance, it is unclear if Trump would support a plan that adds to the budget deficit. Past tax reform efforts have tried to be “revenue neutral.” Trump also has sent mixed messages on Ryan’s proposed “border adjustment tax” that would end the corporate deduction for import costs and make export income tax-free, aiming to boost exports and raise new tax revenues. The Trump team is heavy on Wall Street experience, but short on tax expertise. At Treasury, Mnuchin is the only Senate-confirmed political appointee in place. The job of Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy is unfilled. A person familiar with the hiring process for the job said: “Treasury needs more capable tax expertise ASAP, or the White House will yank total control for tax reform from the department for the rest of the year, maybe beyond.”   Mark Mazur, who held the Treasury tax job under former Democratic President Barack Obama, said Mnuchin has too much on his plate to concentrate fully on taxes. Mnuchin has praised Treasury’s 100 tax policy career staff, but they can only offer options to Trump appointees, said Mazur, now director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. “The political appointees are the ones who need to turn the crank on the sausage-making machine,” Mazur said.

"Republicans are panicking over today s special election in Georgia, which pits Democrat John Ossoff against Republican Trump sycophant and woman who politicized the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Karen Handel.In a normal year, this district wouldn t be competitive at all. But this isn t a normal year. We have the least popular president in our history in office and he happens to be dragging the rest of the party down with him   at least that will be the argument if Ossoff manages to win the squeaker election.Because the election is being seen as a referendum on Trump, a Trump Super-PACs are aggressively targeting voters with some pretty awful tactics, including associating Ossoff with the gunman who shot Rep. Steve Scalise during a baseball practice. Another Trump Super-PAC is using President Obama s voice to mislead voters into voting against Ossoff.Great America Alliance, which calls itself the  largest and most effective pro-Trump Super PAC,  took a passage from Obama s book  Dreams From My Father  to use it against Ossoff. The passage describes Obama s first haircut after arriving in Chicago to become a community organizer.Obama s barber, named Smitty, speaks in the passage of the racial and political tension in Chicago before the city elected Harold Washington as its first black mayor in 1983, and the neglect African Americans felt from the Democratic Party at the time.In the paperback version of the book, Obama directly quotes Smitty s words. In the audio version, Obama reads them aloud.Source: Washington PostOnly instead of using the real meaning of the passage, Great Alliance turned it on its head as a way to get African-American voters to not vote for the Democrat.In the ad, an African-American man named Autry Pruitt says,  Hi, my name is Autry Pruitt, a fellow black American working hard every day, just like you. It may seem out of season, but all of a sudden, Democratic politicians have started coming around again. We normally only see them every other November, swarming around and making promises to get our vote. But nothing ever changes for us, does it? Here s what President Barack Obama had to say about it. Then, President Obama s voice comes on with the out of context quote: A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant,  Obama says.  But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. Then Pruitt tells listeners not to  sell out for another Christmas turkey. Here it is:Don t sell out for a #ChristmasTurkey. The time for change is NOW! #GaPol #GA06 pic.twitter.com/DrKiwbUUVQ  Great ?? Alliance (@TrumpAlliance) June 13, 2017The real passage, though, had nothing to do with the Democratic Party. Instead, it laments a time before Chicago elected its first black mayor, Harold Washington.The misinterpretation is so blatant that Politifact ranks it a  pants on fire  lie.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0
"(Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he was willing to take steps to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula ahead of next year s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, including curtailing military exercises with the United States, NBC said on Tuesday.  It is possible for South Korea and the U.S. to review the possibility of postponing the exercises. I ve made such a suggestion to the U.S., and the U.S. is currently reviewing it. However, all this depends on how North Korea behaves,  Moon said in an interview with NBC News. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee has asked four foreign policy advisers to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign for documents about their contacts with Russians and discussions about Russia. Senator Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday sent letters to former Trump campaign advisers Carter Page, Sam Clovis, J.D. Gordon, and Walid Phares asking them for a range of materials about their contacts with Russians, as well as with each other and other Trump campaign advisers. Feinstein also asked some of the advisers to turn over any documents they have related to efforts to obtain or share “hacked” emails or other electronic data belonging to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, Clinton herself, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee. She asked Gordon about efforts during the 2016 Republican presidential convention in Cleveland to soften proposed party platform language related to Russia and Ukraine.  Convention delegate Diana Denman told Reuters in August 2016 she had proposed platform language urging the United States to provide “lethal defensive weapons” to Ukraine’s armed forces, but that Gordon told her he was going to speak to Trump about her proposal, which was not added to the platform.   In an email to Reuters on Wednesday, Gordon said, “I’m always glad to clear up popular misconceptions, myths and blatant falsehoods surrounding all things Trump-Russia, like I’ve already done with other congressional committees. I look forward to a valuable exchange of information with the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well.” In her letter to Phares, Feinstein said she was interested in a meeting that he, Gordon, and Page allegedly held during the Cleveland convention with Sergei Kislyak, then Russia’s ambassador to the United States.  An aide to Phares said he maintains that Kislyak “was just one of many foreign diplomats present in the audience at a panel discussion” and that such an event “cannot fairly be described as a meeting with Russian officials.” Feinstein asked Page to turn over documents on trips he took to Russia in July and December 2016.   In an email on Wednesday, Page said: “I hope if they can be somewhat reasonable in terms of supporting my efforts to deliver all of this domestic political intelligence to them down in the DC swamp, I’ll be happy to help with this latest tranche of irrelevant Witch Hunt information.”  A lawyer for Clovis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Feinstein is cooperating with Republican Judiciary Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley on some but not all aspects of the committee’s investigation of Trump-Russia allegations.

"Rush Limbaugh nails it in the transcript below but the most disturbing part of the  roadblocking  of Trump is that the refugee resettlement program is to be funded/ expanded  by Congress for fiscal year 2018 and there is  a desire for over 75,000 refugees from mostly Muslim countries THIS year:Republicans in Congress funded the US Refugee Admissions Program at a level for 75,000 refugees to be admitted by September 30th (the last day of this fiscal year):U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  has begun to expand its interview schedule in the 3rd quarter of the fiscal year,  public affairs officer Marilu Cabrera told HuffPost in a statement on Friday. The Department of Homeland Security is working with the State Department to plan for a  further expansion  through the end of fiscal year 2017, she added.We ve immigrated mostly Muslim refugees since 9/11!Pew: More Muslims Than Christians by 2100Why are we continuing down this path when it s a better solution to keep them in safe zones in their own country? This solution was even proposed by President Trump! Small towns across America are being forever changed by the HUGE influx of Muslims. Please see our latest on this below the Rush Limbaugh transcript.Rush Limbaugh let it rip on the Republicans yesterday with his concern that it s the Republicans who are  roadblocking  the Trump agenda:Transcript:I don t understand how people don t get that it s not just the Democrats in Washington that are roadblocking Trump. I mentioned it earlier.Mitch McConnell says he can t see a way to getting 50 votes for the House Obamacare repeal bill? Now, stop and think here, folks. Back when the only element that we had was the House of Representatives and Republican voters were constantly saying,  Why aren t you doing more to stop Obama? Why aren t you trying to do something to stop Obamacare?  The answer was always,  Well, all we ve got is the House. W-w-we can t get anything through the Senate because the Democrats own the Senate. Obama s in the White House! He ll veto anything if it did make it there. So voters gave Republicans the Senate, and Mitch McConnell said,  Well, the first thing you have to know is it takes 60 votes to do anything in the Senate, and we don t have 60 votes. We only have 52.  And then he would add,  Plus, as long as Obama s still in the White House, all this is academic anyway. He s gonna veto whatever we pass.  So we gave the Republicans the White House and elected Trump. Now the latest story  There s a Wall Street Journal story. You know, I had this sort of cram last night after getting back from being away two days.I saw a Wall Street Journal story about how the Republicans in the House, they just can t! It s just impossible. They re pulling their hair out. They don t know what to do. They just can t find a way to cut any taxes. Because every time they cut a tax over here, they have to find a way to make the money up over there, and they just can t. They re looking at all these various tax cuts proposals and they said,  I   I   I don t know how we re gonna pay for all this. So the Republican Party, which is ostensibly the party of the president   and they owe their majority to him, particularly the Senate   are roadblocking Donald Trump more than the Democrats are, because the Democrats cannot. The Democrats don t have the votes in the House to stop Trump. The Democrats don t have the votes in the Senate to stop Trump, although there is the 60-vote cloture requirement. It s not the Democrats standing up and saying,  We are not gonna help. We re gonna stand in the way of any foolish tax cut you propose. It s the Republicans standing up and saying,  I just don t see how we re   there s no room here. I don t know how we re gonna lower rates when you have this exemption over here and you have this exemption there.  And I just read this stuff and I shake my head. They don t want to cut taxes. Either they don t want to cut taxes institutionally, they don t want to cut taxes economically, or they just don t want to do the heavy lifting. I don t know what it is. My guess is they don t want to help Trump.Now, you would think Trump figures this out, but he doesn t give any evidence of it. Like he tweeted something:  U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes immediately and get health care and tax cuts approved fast and easy. Democrats would do it no doubt.  He s talking about getting rid of the 60-vote requirement to shut off debate and just go to simple majority on every bill. Does he know that it s the Republicans that are the roadblock here? He has to know, and certainly if he s got people around him who know.Now, I could understand if he doesn t want to go public and start an internecine battle between the White House and the Republicans on Capitol Hill, you know, keep that for back channels and behind the scenes. The Wall Street Journal had a picture of the chairman of Ways and Means Committee and Paul Ryan standing there and all these guys and the headline:  Republicans Find Yet Another Way to Cut Taxes on the Rich. They just don t see how they can do it. It s incredible. It really is incredible. Because, of course, there s a way. They just don t want to do it. I think it s all establishment, all the time anti-Trump, throw the media in there as well. But even in the middle of this I can tell you almost assuredly that Trump is not off his game. He s not despondent. He s not sitting there worried about why all these people hate him. He s not worried about all that. He s just head down and moving ahead full speed as he can, not reacting or responding to all this stuff in the media, except when he tweets.REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT CONTINUES! Congress approved funding for the refugee resettlement program! This is NOT good news and is shocking to see that they are keeping the pipeline going on bringing mostly Muslim refugees to America. You have to ask why they continue to ignore this failed boondoggle that the American taxpayers fund each year:It is because most of them work for their big business donors and the Chamber of Commerce to guarantee a steady supply of cheap immigrant labor! Adding insult to injury, your tax dollars support refugee families through the welfare system because wages are too low! You pay for the importation of the labor and for the laborers  support once here!It is really quite a difficult obstacle for us (who wish to see the USRAP reformed) to overcome big businesses and global corporations pushing cheap labor in conjunction with so-called  religious  charities (paid by taxpayers!) claiming this is all about humanitarianism while essentially acting as  head hunters  for big business.Here s HuffPo s latest on the pipeline flowing:The United States appears to be resuming its longstanding efforts to resettle refugees after the program was derailed and almost completely upended abroad for several months.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  has begun to expand its interview schedule in the 3rd quarter of the fiscal year,  public affairs officer Marilu Cabrera told HuffPost in a statement on Friday. The Department of Homeland Security is working with the State Department to plan for a  further expansion  through the end of fiscal year 2017, she added.",0
"Donald Trump has to be the most corrupt  president  America has ever seen. After his infamous firing of FBI Director James Comey over the investigation into his campaign s ties to Russia, Trump was reportedly infuriated that his racist elf of an Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from all things related to Russia. Then, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein saw fit to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a Special Counsel to get to the bottom of the Russia matter. Now, it seems that Mueller, who enjoys broad bipartisan support and has an impeccable reputation in Washington, is now in Trump s crosshairs. In fact, it is now being reported that Trump wanted to fire Mueller, and was only stopped by his own White House staff, because any thinking person knows that this would be a political   and potentially legal- disaster.The rumors of Trump s intention to fire Mueller were first fueled by an interview that Newsmax CEO and close Trump confidante Christopher Ruddy gave to PBS Newshour. In that interview, Ruddy said of what he knew of Trump s paranoid thinking on the matter: I think he s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel. I think he s weighing that option. Well, Trump had better get that option out of his head; after all, even the GOP sycophants in Congress are saying that this is a bridge too far, and that Trump needs to leave Special Counsel Mueller alone and let him do his investigation. Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), who is the Ranking Member on the House Intelligence Committee has already told Trump that going after Mueller would be a waste of time, because Congress would intervene.If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately re-establish independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Don't waste our time.  Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) June 12, 2017Trump is acting like Richard Nixon did toward the end of Watergate. If he starts trying to treat Robert Mueller like Richard Nixon treated Archibald Cox, it will not end well for him.Let s see you fire Robert Mueller, you orange buffoon. You ll die in jail if the people who actually care about this nation have anything to say about it.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",0
"Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez didn t mince words when he called out the GOP for their appalling health care plan. Their plan would have resulted in tens of millions of Americans being without insurance coverage by the end of the next decade. Perez made his point loud and clear when he explained that the reason Republicans are okay with this plan is because they just  don t give a sh*t about people. Perez made the comments at an event for the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, which was broadcast live on Facebook. While speaking to the crowd, he discussed Republicans  failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last month.The DNC chair said that Trump  wants his name on everything,  but for some reason, he didn t want his name associated with the GOP s  Make America Sick Again  plan in any way, shape, or form. Well I ll tell you my idea, because you know what embodies their program?  I don t care,  Perez said of the GOP s health care plan, prompting a round of applause from the crowd. Because they don t give a s  about people. Perez served as former President Barack Obama s Labor secretary and was elected as chairman of the DNC in February. His first act in this new role was to nominate Rep. Keith Ellison, who had run against him for the position, as his deputy.You can watch Perez slam the GOP and their wealth care plan in the video below, via the New Jersey Working Families Alliance: Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",0
"Billionaire investor and all around puppet master, George Soros, said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he would invest $500 million to meet the needs refugees.The payout answers the Obama administration s  Call to Action  initiative, asking U.S. companies to help ease the migrant crisis.Soros, the founder of the Open Society Foundations, stated that he intends to work as closely as possible with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to properly manage his investments.Fact Sheet for Obama s  Call To Action : ViewHow are these refugees chosen and vetted, an by whom?It is a bit concerning that to even get on the site that can provide the information on how refugees are vetted you have to sign in to the National Journal website.The BBC did piece on the vetting process that outlines the UN s deep ties to the system: ViewThis outline details how the UN and the U.S. State Department basically run the vetting process. Which is extremely concerning seeing as how Obama has been known to recruit Muslim Foreign Service Officers through Jihad Conferences, as reported here at Judicial WatchIf you look closely at the above links and tie them all to what we know is a corrupt relationship between Soros and Obama it becomes very apparent that the influx of refugees isn t a charitable act to save lives. We re being taken over by an outstanding number of possibly dangerous individuals and they are funded by those up on high.Basically muslims are vetting other muslims and telling us they are not dangerous while the government drives us farther into debt with the expense of these refugees even though they know that many if not most of these refugees are in fact ties somehow to terrorist organizations with a strong intent to kill us. No wonder the terrorist attack numbers on our homeland has been higher in the last 8 years then ever in American history.How do you feel about that? I for one am not ok with any of it.

"A man almost lost his life on a flight out of Detroit because of a racist flight crew member who apparently forgot that it s 2016 and black women are allowed to be doctors. I know, it seems shocking to someone with that mindset, but we re pretty much over the who  not allowing someone to follow their dreams and live up to their potential because of their skin color  thing. Unfortunately, the crew of Delta flight DL945 didn t get the memo.When a passenger became unresponsive during the flight, the crew leaped into action looking for a doctor   and Dr. Tamika Cross would have done so as well, if they thought someone with her dark complexion was capable of being a medical professional. On Facebook, Cross vented her frustration with representatives of the airline:When Cross initially attempted to inform the crew she was a doctor by raising her hand as she was asked, she was flatly told her silly dark-skinned medical knowledge was useless to them   even though a man was dying. Oh no sweetie put ur hand down, we are looking for actual physicians or nurses or some type of medical personnel, we don t have time to talk to you,  Cross says a flight attendant informed her, overtalking her attempts to explain that she is a licensed medical professional with condescension. Any physician on board please press your button  the crew urged, as no one but Cross had responded. She pushed her button.  Oh wow you re an actual physician?  the flabbergasted crew member asked before demanding to see Cross s credentials and asking a series of questions that should not be asked when a man is dying and time is of the essence:   What type of doctor are you? Where do you work? Why were you in Detroit? Fortunately, a white man stepped forward to save the day because the crew obviously was having a tough time finding a doctor who met their qualifications (apparently white skin being the qualification). Cross was told  thanks for your help but he can help us, and he has his credentials.  He did not, in fact, show the crew anything, Cross points out in her post.After Mr. White Doctor saved the day, the same crew member had the nerve to come to Cross with questions about treatment before ultimately  apologizing  for her blatantly racist behavior and trying to bribe Cross with skymiles. Cross refused.Unfortunately, while we have made great progress, we still have a long way to go in terms of race relations in America   and Delta is not going to have a very good week trying to make this problem go away.Featured image via Facebook",0
"ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT (Reuters) - A court in Alexandria has ordered the detention of leading rights activist Mahienour el-Massry over charges of illegally protesting in June against the Egyptian government s decision to transfer two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. El-Massry was detained in Egypt s second largest city along with activist Moatasim Medhat and both will be held pending their trial for illegal assembly on Dec. 30, the misdemeanour court said. The pair s lawyer, Taher Abo Nasser, said they denied the charges, adding that there was no evidence of a protest taking place.  The decision came as a shock for us but Mahienour is remaining strong and accepting,  Abo Nasser said. The plan to cede the islands to Saudi Arabia was announced last year and has become mired in political protest and legal action. Opponents of the plan say Egypt s sovereignty over the islands dates back to 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded. Saudi and Egyptian officials say the islands belong to the kingdom and were only under Egyptian control because Riyadh had asked Cairo in 1950 to protect them. ",1

"Members of the Catholic church need to pay close attention to the radical statements that are being made by the Vatican s top advisor, Jeffrey Sachs. Sachs has been described as  arguably the world s foremost proponent of population control,  including abortion.Top Vatican adviser Jeffrey Sachs says that when Pope Francis visits the United States in September, he will directly challenge the  American idea  of God-given rights embodied in the Declaration of Independence.Sachs, a special advisor to the United Nations and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, is a media superstar who can always be counted on to pontificate endlessly on such topics as income inequality and global health. This time, writing in a Catholic publication, he may have gone off his rocker, revealing the real global game plan.The United States, Sachs writes in the Jesuit publication, America, is  a society in thrall  to the idea of unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But the  urgent core of Francis  message  will be to challenge this  American idea  by  proclaiming that the path to happiness lies not solely or mainly through the defense of rights but through the exercise of virtues, most notably justice and charity. In these extraordinary comments, which constitute a frontal assault on the American idea of freedom and national sovereignty, Sachs has made it clear that he hopes to enlist the Vatican in a global campaign to increase the power of global or foreign-dominated organizations and movements.Sachs takes aim at the phrase, which comes from America s founding document, the United States Declaration of Independence, that  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. These rights sound good, Sachs writes, but they re not enough to guarantee the outcome the global elites have devised for us. Global government, he suggests, must make us live our lives according to international standards of development. In the United States,  Sachs writes,  we learn that the route to happiness lies in the rights of the individual. By throwing off the yoke of King George III, by unleashing the individual pursuit of happiness, early Americans believed they would achieve that happiness. Most important, they believed that they would find happiness as individuals, each endowed by the creator with individual rights. While he says there is some  grandeur in this idea,  such rights  are only part of the story, only one facet of our humanity. The Sachs view is that global organizations such as the U.N. must dictate the course of nations and individual rights must be sacrificed for the greater good. One aspect of this unfolding plan, as outlined in the Sachs book, The End of Poverty, involves extracting billions of dollars from the American people through global taxes. We will need, in the end, to put real resources in support of our hopes,  he wrote.  A global tax on carbon-emitting fossil fuels might be the way to begin. Even a very small tax, less than that which is needed to correct humanity s climate-deforming overuse of fossil fuels, would finance a greatly enhanced supply of global public goods.  Sachs has estimated the price tag for the U.S. at $845 billion.In preparation for this direct assault on our rights, the American nation-state, and our founding document, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon told a Catholic Caritas International conference in Rome on May 12 that climate change is  the defining challenge of our time,  and that the solution lies in recognizing that  humankind is part of nature, not separate or above. The pope s expected encyclical on climate change is supposed to help mobilize the governments of the world in this crusade.But a prestigious group of scholars, churchmen, scientists, economists, and policy experts has issued a detailed rebuttal, entitled,  An Open Letter to Pope Francis on Climate Change,  pointing out that the Bible tells man to have dominion over the earth. Good climate policy must recognize human exceptionalism, the God-given call for human persons to  have dominion  in the natural world (Genesis 1:28), and the need to protect the poor from harm, including actions that hinder their ascent out of poverty,  the letter to Pope Francis states.Released by a group called the Cornwall Alliance, the letter urges the Vatican to consider the evidence that climate change is largely natural, that the human contribution is comparatively small and not dangerous, and that attempting to mitigate the human contribution by reducing CO2 emissions  would cause more harm than good, especially to the world s poor. The Heartland Institute held a news conference on April 27 at the Hotel Columbus in Rome to warn the Vatican against embracing the globalist agenda of the climate change movement. The group is hosting the 10th International Conference on Climate Change in Washington, D.C., on June 11-12.However, it appears as if the Vatican has been captured by the globalist forces associated with Sachs and the United Nations.Voice of the Family, a group representing pro-life and pro-family Catholic organizations from around the world, has taken issue not only with the Vatican s involvement with Sachs, but with Ban Ki Moon, describing the two as  noted advocates of abortion who operate at the highest levels of the United Nations. Sachs has been described as  arguably the world s foremost proponent of population control,  including abortion.Voice of the Family charges that environmental issues such as climate change have become  an umbrella to cover a wide spectrum of attacks on human life and the family. Although Sachs likes to claim he was an adviser to Pope John Paul II, the noted anti-communist and pro-life pontiff, Sachs simply served as a member of a group of economists invited to confer with the Pontifical Council on Justice and Peace in advance of the release of a papal document.In fact, Pope John Paul II had worked closely with the Reagan administration in opposition to communism and the global population control movement. He once complained that a U.N. conference on population issues was designed to  destroy the family  and was the  snare of the devil. Pope Francis, however, seems to have embraced the very movements opposed by John Paul II.Sachs, who has emerged as a very influential Vatican adviser, recently tweeted that he was  thrilled  to be at the Vatican  discussing moral dimensions of climate change and sustainable development.  The occasion was a Vatican workshop on global warming on April 28, 2015, sponsored by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences of the Roman Catholic Church. Sachs was a featured speaker.The plan going forward involves the launching of what are called  Sustainable Development Goals,  as envisioned by a Sustainable Development Solutions Network run by none other than Jeffrey Sachs. The Network has proposed draft Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which contain provisions that are radically antagonistic to the right to life from conception to natural death, to the rights and dignity of the family and to the rights of parents as the primary educators of their children,  states the group Voice of the Family.In July, a Financing for Development conference will be held, in order to develop various global tax proposals, followed by a conference in Paris in December to complete a new climate change agreement.Before that December conference, however, Sachs says the pope will call on the world at the United Nations to join the crusade for a New World Order.Sachs says,  Pope Francis will come to the United States and the United Nations in New York on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the United Nations, and at the moment when the world s 193 governments are resolved to take a step in solidarity toward a better world. On Sept. 25, Pope Francis will speak to the world leaders most likely the largest number of assembled heads of state and government in history as these leaders deliberate to adopt new Sustainable Development Goals for the coming generation. These goals will be a new worldwide commitment to build a world that aims to harmonize the pursuit of economic prosperity with the commitments to social inclusion and environmental sustainability. Rather than emphasize the absolute need for safeguarding individual rights in the face of government overreach and power, Sachs writes that the Gospel teachings of humility, love, and justice,  like the teachings of Aristotle, Buddha and Confucius,  can take us on a  path to happiness through compassion  and  become our guideposts back to safety. Writing elsewhere in the new issue of America, Christiana Z. Peppard, an assistant professor of theology, science, and ethics at Fordham University, writes about the  planetary pope,  saying,  What is really at stake in the collective response to the pope s encyclical is not, ultimately, whether our treasured notions of theology, science, reality or development can accommodate moral imperatives. The real question is whether we are brave enough and willing to try. The plan is quite simple: world government through global taxes, with a religious face to bring it about.Via: Western Journalism",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court, which delivered major rulings in 2012 and 2015 preserving President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, on Tuesday declined to take up a new, long-shot challenge to Obamacare brought by an Iowa artist. The court turned away an appeal by Matt Sissel, who had asserted that the 2010 Affordable Care Act violated the U.S. Constitution’s requirement that revenue-raising legislation must originate in the House of Representatives, not in the Senate, as the healthcare law did. The high court left in place a 2014 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholding a lower court’s dismissal of the lawsuit, which was backed by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group. The suit targeted the law’s “individual mandate” that Americans obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty. In a 6-3 ruling last June, the Supreme Court rejected a conservative legal challenge and upheld nationwide tax subsidies crucial to the healthcare law. In 2012, the justices ruled 5-4 that the law’s requirement that Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty was authorized by the power of Congress to levy taxes. A three-judge appeals court panel was unanimous in finding that Sissel’s interpretation of the law was at odds with U.S. Supreme Court precedents, including the high court’s ruling in 2012. The court found that the penalty for not obtaining insurance was a form of taxation. The law was passed by Obama’s fellow Democrats in Congress in 2010 over the unified opposition of Republicans, and conservatives who call the measure a government overreach have fought it since its inception. The landmark law was designed to provide healthcare for millions of uninsured Americans. Obama this month vetoed legislation passed by the Republican-led Congress that would have dismantled the law. In the spring, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case brought by religious groups seeking an exemption from a provision of the law that requires them to provide contraception coverage in their health insurance policies. The case is Sissel v. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 15-543. ",1
"We re wondering if Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) is OK. He just doesn t seem to be himself lately. The South Carolina Republican was so fiercely critical of alleged president Donald Trump, but that s all suddenly changed now. Graham, who once called Trump a  jackass,  praised the amateur president on Saturday as a leader who is open-minded  and is even willing to reach out for help, even late at night, according to the Washington Examiner. What have I learned about our president? He s curious, he asks questions, and he knows no fear,  Graham said in his remarks at the South Carolina Republican convention.  And he s under siege unlike any president I ve ever seen in my entire life   They don t believe he won; I do. Now Obama was somewhat hard for us, but I thought we were somewhat respectful,  Graham added without one bit of irony whatsoever.Graham then went to on to disrespect former President Barack Obama by calling him a  community organizer who apologized for America every turn all over the world. Let me tell you that you have a commander in chief that s not going to let this country get walked over anymore,  he said.And that s really cute, don t you think? He said that of Obama who had 20 years of experience under his belt before taking the job as President while praising a former reality show star who had zero experience in politics. He calls and I m honored that he would call me and I want to help him,  he said.  He calls me when I m asleep and he calls me after I go to bed. I wish he would rest more. I gave him my phone number. So far so good. It s nice he has a cozy relationship with a man who just recently penned him a letter to assure him that he has no connections to Russia. Lindsey Graham requested that information. Trump s lawyers said in the letter that a review of the last 10 years of Trump s tax returns revealed that he has no income from Russia  with a few exceptions. Here s the kicker: The law firm who sent the letter actually has deep ties to   wait for it   Russia. Lindsey Graham appeared to be that one Republican with a spine willing to call out the White House, but now he s rolling over while claiming that Republicans respected Obama. Democrats are just being big ol  meanies to the man who is plagued in scandals while only 120ish days into the job.Trump, for the record, is the same man who dogged Obama for years, insisting that our first black President was actually a scary Muslim from Kenya. Obama did not have conflicts of interest. The biggest scandal at this same amount of time during Obama s presidency was that he put Dijon mustard on his hamburger. That was the big scandal featured on Fox News for a week. In contrast, Trump has a massive amount of conflicts of interest.Sure, Lindsey, we ll give Trump the same respect Republicans gave Obama.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Tuesday that more sanctions on North Korea are unlikely to change the country s behavior but would cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.  Do we think more sanctions are going to work on North Korea? Not necessarily,  Haley told the American Enterprise Institute.  But what does it do? It cuts off the revenue that allows them to build ballistic missiles.  Haley said on Monday she wants the United Nations Security Council to vote on Sept. 11 to impose  the strongest possible  sanctions on North Korea over its sixth and largest nuclear test. ",1
"NAIROBI (Reuters) - A French IT company that supplied the electronic system used in Kenya s nullified election last month has told the election commission its technology will not be ready to use again by the Oct. 17 date set for a re-run of the vote. The statement presents a hurdle for the commission. It could threaten the timing of the election that President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose win on Aug. 8 win was canceled by the Supreme Court, will contest against opposition leader Raila Odinga. When the Supreme Court nullified the results of the presidential election citing irregularities, it ordered a new poll within 60 days. The commission then declared Oct. 17 as the date for the re-run. In a letter from Paris-based OT-Morpho to the election commission, the company said the two electronic systems it supplied for the vote would have to be reinstalled for the re-run.  This represents a very significant amount of work, which cannot be secured by October 17,  said the letter dated Sept. 18 and seen by Reuters. OT-Morpho provided 45,000 tablets for identifying voters using biometric technology and the system used to transmit results counted at polling stations as well as a photograph of the paper sheet from each station. Delays in transmission of the tally sheets was an irregularity raised by the opposition in its petition to the Supreme Court. The court has not released its full verdict but has said it will do so by Thursday. A spokesman for the company confirmed the letter was accurate. Andrew Limo, a spokesman for the election board, said he was aware of the letter and the board met on Monday to discuss it. Earlier in the day, he told Reuters that  changing the date (of the election re-run) is a last resort strategy.  The date of the new poll has been a source of tension between Kenyatta and Odinga. Kenyatta and his ruling Jubilee party have said the re-run should be held on Oct. 17 as scheduled by the commission, while the opposition is threatening to boycott the new poll if its demands for the sacking of key election officials are not met.

" Minneapolis mayoral candidate Raymond Dehn proposes disarming cops in wake of Damond shooting. Only one year ago, the FBI named Minneapolis, MN as one of the most dangerous cities in America. Minneapolis is also home to the largest Somali refugee population in America. According to the Star Tribune, Minnesota remains near the top among states for refugee resettlement, measured as a share of state population. It is also the top destination for refugees who move from the state where they were originally resettled. Of the 2,338 total, almost 45 percent hailed from Somalia.In the wake of the shooting death of Australian Justine Damond, Raymond Dehn, a candidate in the race for Minneapolis mayor has proposed disarming police officersThe Australian woman was shot dead by police officer Mohamed Noor after calling 911 to report a suspected sexual assault. Officers don t need to carry a gun on their person all the time,  said Raymond Dehn, one of the frontrunners in the mayoral race and who currently serves in the Minnesota House of Representatives. Currently, officers carry all sorts of assault weapons in their cars. So why can t one of those weapons be the side arm (such as a baton that sits on a holster)? It s important that we begin to have a conversation, and I would say that all things are on the table. We live in a culture where guns are pervasive. Cops carrying guns is part of a larger conversation about guns in our society,  he said, according to the Star Tribune .Better yet, how about just disarm the cops who, like Mohamed Noor, are only on the force to demonstrate Minneapolis  commitment to  diversity,  rather than because they re competent to be police officers?Even better still, how about hire and fire cops based on merit, rather than for their value as trophy Muslims or Somalis on the force?Nah   that would be  Islamophobic.

"After only serving less than 4 years on the bench, Barack Obama nominated U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in 2012. Only one week ago, Judge Walker made what many consider a very controversial decision that forces the state of Florida to accept voter registration forms for one extra day because of Hurricane Matthew. Today, Obama appointed U.S. District Judge Mark Walker made another controversial decision after the Democratic Party sued the state. This decision clearly opens the door for extensive voter fraud. If you don t sign your ballot, your vote doesn t count. Seems like a pretty simple concept Pay attention to, and know about the judges on your ballots this November because judges decisions matter Calling the state s current law  illogical  and  bizarre,  a federal judge late Sunday ordered the state of Florida to give thousands of voters a chance to make sure their vote-by-mail ballots are counted.U.S. District Judge Mark Walker ruled that county election offices should notify voters if their signature on a vote-by-mail ballot and their voter registration forms don t match. Voters would then be given a chance to fix the problem by 5 p.m. the day before the election.The Florida Democratic Party sued the state because currently voters who don t sign their vote-by-mail ballot are given a chance to fix it. But voters whose signatures don t match aren t told about the problem until after the election is over and their ballot is discarded.Walker said that makes the law unconstitutional.Meredith Beatrice, a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Ken Detzner, said state officials were reviewing the decision.It is not clear exactly how many voters would be affected by the decision. But more than 23,000 vote-by-mail ballots were rejected by Florida election officials during the 2012 presidential election where President Barack Obama carried the state by slightly more than 74,000 votes.Nearly 513,000 Floridians have already voted by mail according to data compiled by the Florida Division of Elections. And another 2.4 million vote-by-mail ballots have been requested.Judge Walker, citing the contentious 2000 Florida election where George W. Bush carried the state over Al Gore by 537 votes, said he needed to act because the current practice was enough of a burden to affect the outcome of an election and  by extension, our country s future. Florida s Republican-controlled Legislature in 2004 passed a law that said all vote-by-mail ballots that had mismatched signatures or did not contain a signature were to be tossed out. But then in 2013 legislators changed the law to allow people who turned in a ballot without a signature to fix the mistake prior to the election.Detzner, the state s top election official, did not try to defend the current law. Instead his lawyers asserted that he could not order county election offices to correct the problem and that he was not the proper person to sue. Walker disagreed sharply in his decision. Via AP ",0
"(Reuters) - Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards plans to sign legislation making it a hate crime to kill a police officer or another first responder, bolstering penalties for an offense that already qualifies for the state’s death penalty, his office said on Tuesday. The legislation adds language to an existing law enhancing penalties for crimes targeting people based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and other identity categories to include “actual or perceived employment as a law enforcement officer, firefighter or emergency medical services personnel.”     Edwards, a Democrat whose relatives have served as law enforcement officers, is expected to sign the bill sometime this week. The state legislature unanimously approved the measure last week.  “Police officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society,” he said in a statement. “The members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections.”  Supporters say police officers are facing increased threats simply because they wear a badge. Advocates for the law have dubbed the Louisiana measure “Blue Lives Matter,” a reference to the color of uniforms often worn by police. The name draws on a prominent national movement, known as Black Lives Matter, which has generated wide protest over the killings of unarmed black citizens by police officers. Yet opponents argued that the bill was unnecessary because state law already makes it a capital offense to kill police officers in the course of duty. Critics say it could weaken the hate crimes law by including a professional distinction that a matter of choice, in contrast to the color of someone’s skin.  “Adding professional categories to the current Hate Crimes statue deters efforts from protecting against identity-based crimes,” Allison Padilla-Goodman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas, said in a statement earlier this month. Louisiana would be the first state to use a hate crimes statute to enhance penalties for crimes against police officers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but other states allow for similar outcomes using different approaches.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - State Department officials briefed Senate staff on Friday on plans to cut up to $10 billion from the department’s budget over five years, but offered few specifics to ease concerns that the administration risked weakening U.S. standing in the world. The plan is the result of an ongoing assessment of the department ordered by President Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. It includes broad goals such as “maximizing the impact of foreign assistance” and “improving governance” for information technology platforms, according to a copy of the presentation seen by Reuters. Members of Congress have been vying with the Trump administration for more influence over foreign policy. In particular, many lawmakers, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, worry about his plans to slash the State Department budget to help boost military spending. The Republican-led Senate Appropriations Committee issued a blistering report last week accompanying its spending plan for State, accusing the Trump administration of pursuing a “doctrine of retreat” on foreign policy. Last week, the committee voted 31-0 for legislation allocating more than $51 billion for the State Department and foreign operations next year, nearly $11 billion more than the Trump administration’s request. The presentation was more specific as it listed what State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) did not intend to do. That list said there is no plan to dismantle State and USAID, eliminate the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, or concentrate power in Tillerson’s hands. A Senate aide who attended said both Republicans and Democrats seemed frustrated at the lack of specifics.  “It was tense in the room at times, with staff from both parties asking for specifics and warning the State Department officials that it would be difficult to defend this given the lack of specificity and the ongoing problems with early, consistent Congressional consultation on a range of issues,” the aide said. Tillerson wants to eliminate more than 2,000 positions at State, out of some 75,000 worldwide. At a news conference this week, Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the subcommittee that oversees State Department spending, spoke of his opposition to such cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid. “I fear that we’re going to get caught blindsided without a robust State Department,” Graham said, saying that ensuring national security requires soft power as well as a strong military.

"Former NH Governor John Sununu let Alison Camarata have it when she asked about the Russia investigation and Robert Mueller. Sununu said that Trump should have been notified if he was under investigation and then he slammed Mueller for hiring all Dems.Camerota:  Should the White House know if the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice? Sununu:  If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified. Sununu:  What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President. Maybe Mueller has decided internally that this isn t going anywhere and that the only way he can have credibility on a decision saying that there s nothing there is to have that decision come from a group of lawyers that are so blatantly biased against the President.

"Beginning in 2011, Republican-controlled states began setting up what they claim is a system to identify voters who have voted in more than one place.As reported on Democracy Now, at least 27 states began using an interstate  cross-checking system,  which identifies voters whose names appear on the voter rolls in more than one state.Investigative reporter Greg Palast was able to access the list of flagged voters, which has now grown to include more than seven million names.As Palast explains during a recent episode of Redacted Tonight, not a single person whose name appears on the list of flagged voters has been prosecuted for voter fraud.In fact, none of the people whose names have been removed from the voting rolls for  suspected voter fraud  has even been reported for further investigation.That s because Republicans know that this system does not identify people who are voting multiple times, as they claim it does.After reviewing the list firsthand, Palast discovered that it is made up of voters who have very common names; for example, Joe Smith.While it would be surprising if a name like Joe Smith didn t appear multiple times on several state voter rolls, the system flags any voter who  appears to be registered twice.  Worse, it even flags voters who may have the same first and last name as another person, but an entirely different middle name.Not surprisingly, the interstate cross-check system overwhelmingly impacts minority and Democratic voters.During a March 10, 2016 interview with Lee Camp, Palast described the likely impact of the interstate  crosscheck  system on the 2016 election.Watch the interview below:Palast first began sounding the alarm over inaccuracies in the interstate  crosscheck  system in 2014.A thirty-minute special report titled  Jim Crow Returns: Interstate  Crosscheck  Program threatens Millions of Voters,  provides a closer look at the list of voters who have been impacted by the bogus system.Watch the full report below, via Greg Palast on YouTube:Millions of voters are likely to be kicked from the voter rolls between now and November, if they haven t been already.One of the most important things voters can do to protect their voting rights is regularly check their status as a registered voter.As we get closer to the general election, republicans will step up their efforts to disenfranchise as many democratic voters as possible.Lee Camp s third video in the series Seven Ways To Beat The Ballot Bandits drives the point home:Go here to find out what else you can do to preserve and protect your vote.Image credit: video screen capture via Greg Palast on youtube",0
"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India s foreign minister defended the country s ties with North Korea and Iran during talks on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson aimed at building robust relations between the two giant democracies. The Trump administration has launched a new U.S. effort to deepen military and economic ties with India as a way to balance China s assertive posture across Asia.   At the talks with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, both sides pledged to strengthen anti-terrorism cooperation and Tillerson said Washington stood ready to provide India with advanced military technology.   The United States supports India s emergence as a leading power and will continue to contribute to Indian capabilities to provide security throughout the region,  Tillerson told a joint news conference with Swaraj.  But the talks also touched on India s diplomatic ties with North Korea, Swaraj said, at a time when the United States has stepped up efforts to isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. Swaraj said she told the top U.S. diplomat that some level of diplomatic presence was necessary to keep open channels of communication.   As far as the question of embassy goes, our embassy there is very small, but there is in fact an embassy,  she said.  I told Secretary Tillerson that some of their friendly countries should maintain embassies there so that some channels of communication are kept open.  India and North Korea maintain diplomatic offices in each other s capitals, though New Delhi recently banned trade of most goods with the country, except food and medicine. Trade was minimal, Swaraj said. The focus on North Korea comes as U.S. President Donald Trump heads to China next month, where he is expected to urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to try to rein in North Korea. Tillerson, who flew in from Pakistan which he called an important U.S. ally in the restive region, also held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is driving closer ties with the United States. But India, a former leading light of the Non-Aligned Movement and which was on the opposite side of the United States during the Cold War, still remains wary of any alliances with major powers lest it affect its autonomy. India has also maintained ties with Iran which is being targeted by the Trump administration for its alleged military support of extremist groups in the Middle East and for its ballistic missile programme. India has long sourced its oil from Iran, but in recent years the two sides have been also collaborating on key infrastructure projects.  New Delhi is pushing hard for the development of Chabahar port on the Iranian coast as a hub for its trade links to the resource-rich countries of central Asia and Afghanistan but the Trump administration s tough stance has raised new concerns over the future of that project.   But Tillerson struck a conciliatory stance on India s ties with Iran, saying it wouldn t come in the way of countries doing legitimate business there.   It is not our objective to harm the Iranian people nor is it our objective to interfere with legitimate business activities that are going on with other businesses, whether they be from Europe, India or agreements that are in place or promote economic development and activity to the benefit of our friends and allies,  he said.  America s disagreements were with the Iranian regime, and in particular the Iran Revolutionary Guard, he said.  India is especially keen on the Chabahar port as a way to bypass long-time foe Pakistan which does not allow easy trade and transit arrangements to Afghanistan and beyond. Tillerson said the U.S. stood should-to-shoulder with India in the fight against terrorism which New Delhi has long said is centered in militant groups operating from inside Pakistan.  He said militant groups were a threat to everyone in the region, including Pakistan itself.  Quite frankly my view - and I expressed this to the leadership of Pakistan - is we also are concerned about the stability and security of Pakistan s government as well.  The United States has been urging Pakistan to act against the groups that operate in Afghanistan, India and inside Pakistan itself.  Terrorist safe havens will not be tolerated,  Tillerson said. Pakistan says it is doing all it can to fight the militants.  ",1

"What s happening in the United States is not okay. What s being allowed to happen is not okay. We currently have a person running for President of the United States who is not only condoning violence, but instigating and encouraging it. Recent Donald Trump rallies have turned into something very reminiscent of Nazi Germany from the 1930s and 40s. If this doesn t terrify you, wake up. If you approve of this, you re part of the problem.In yet another move to motivate his band of merry morons who are clearly unhinged and will do his bidding at a moment s notice, Trump tweets out a direct threat to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders as well as his supporters who attend his rallies. The real estate mogul seems to think that Sanders is lying when he says that his supporters aren t told to go to Trump events, so he took that as his cue to threaten Sanders back.Trump said: Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren t told to go to my events.

This is getting very scary, folks, and Trump needs to be held accountable for inciting violence.Bernie Sanders has since spoken out against Trump and his ridiculous allegations. The Sanders campaign just retweeted this to make the message clear. Bernie said while on ABC News: Well, I think anybody who understands Mr. Trump s campaign knows that he tells the truth very, very rarely, and I m afraid that on this occasion, he s lying again.

"Late Monday night, CNN s Don Lemon had a phone guest who called in to the show from the apartment she was trapped in with her cousin and a one-month-old baby. Ices Bragg, in a pronounced southern drawl, described the scene around her: Rising water, fires visible from the window nearby, and perhaps most disturbing of all, an upstairs neighbor taking advantage of the situation.Lemon asked the woman to repeat what she had told him previously about the neighbor:Lemon: You told us last hour that one of your neighbors was trying to go upstairs to another apartment, and what happened?Bragg: Um, the lady had told her that if she had three hundred dollars to come in to her apartment, she would let her.Lemon: Wow. Unbelievable.Bragg: Yes sir, it is.The exchange was heart-stopping. We saw price-gouging on gas after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, but watching big companies take advantage of desperate consumers is almost nothing new in this country. To hear an account of a neighbor, with the advantage of higher ground, threatening to let people die unless they pony up is nothing short of shocking.An economy based on unbridled capitalism like we see in America almost guarantees that there will be price-gouging in some areas during times of heightened demand for whatever someone s selling. But at the very least, there are laws prohibiting the practice during a state of emergency. That s little comfort to the poor, but it does mean that this upstairs neighbor could   no pun intended   pay a price.This is not the first report of price-gouging in the state. Houston is currently deluged with trillions of gallons of water. When those waters recede, the complaints that have been pouring in to the Texas Attorney General s office will likely result in serious trouble for those they hold to account.Watch the CNN clip here:Featured image via video screen capture",0
"CNN, MSNBC, AlJazeera, NBC, ABC, CBS and the other mainstream media outlets would like you to believe these  refugees  are just good wholesome people looking for a better way of life. Who the heck is vetting these people? Does anyone even care that we have no idea who is gaining admittance into our countries with no background checks? Has anyone thought through what it will mean to flood all of Europe and America with Muslim refugees who have no intention of assimilating with our cultures and heritage? The propaganda and spin on this  crisis  is completely insane! Where were these bleeding heart nations when Christians were watching entire communities being burned to the ground in Pakistan by Muslims? Who was bringing boatloads of persecuted Kurds to Europe and America when ISIS came to town? How about we pay attention to the real story, as told by Aida Bolev r:Aida Bolev r, an Arabic-speaking European woman who traveled on a train departing Budapest alongside migrants reveals how the  refugees  robbed Hungarians, used children as human shields and threatened to take her hostage and rape her.Aida Bolev r lived in the Middle East for five years and is fluent in Arabic. At the start of the video, she stresses that she is not trying to make the migrants look bad by telling her story.Arriving at Keleti railway station in Budapest, Bolev r said she was shocked to see a mass of  filthy  people who refused to let her enter the building and tried to steal her luggage while hurling insults.After witnessing some of the migrants  without shame, simply defecating where they stood,  Bolev r said some of the women were being beaten by their own husbands. All they could think to do in the heat of the moment was to grab the luggage of passersby and shout obscenities (at) them,  said Bolev r, adding that 90% of the migrants were men aged 18-45.Bolev r says the men  grabbed random children  and tried to use them as human shields in order to board the train, Bedlam then ensued, with windows cracking and fights breaking out as waves of people surged onto the train.Bolev r was sat near four other people who had purchased tickets for the train. They began talking to each other in a relaxed tone, considering whether or not they should rob us, since that would please Allah because we were infidels. As for me, it would really be worth raping me because I am not dressed like a proper woman, I haven t got a hijab on my head, that is, I m not Muslim, and so I am bad,  said Bolev r.When Bolev r and the four other passengers attempted to get off the train, the migrants began discussing whether or not to take them as hostages and wouldn t let them leave.After Bolev r was finally able to walk back into the train station, she saw migrants carelessly throwing food onto the floor. They were all shouting one word repeatedly: Money! That is, give us money,  said Bolev r.  They were grabbing at people, trying to tear away some valuables, they were grabbing at luggage and wouldn t let people pass, they shoved and insulted. Those people are the same ones that Europe accepted in the name of tolerance, so before we protect these people I suggest we learn the Arabic language,  she concluded.Bolev r s story provides yet more contradictions to the image of the migrants that has been portrayed by the mass media of humble people fleeing war who are polite and grateful. As the footage below illustrates, the reality is somewhat different.As we previously reported, the German media and police in some areas are covering up rapes committed by migrants to as not to offend the flood of new Muslim  refugees  entering the country.The Gatestone Institute has compiled a lengthy list of rapes committed by migrants in and around refugee camps in Germany, the victims of which are mainly teenagers and children (including other migrants and Germans living locally).Schools in Germany situated near migrant camps are also warning girls not to wear shorts or skirts so as not to offend migrants and provoke  attacks .Meanwhile, in another video,  refugees  at a camp in the Netherlands complain about the facility having slow Internet, average food and not being given enough money to buy cigarettes.Via: InfoWars",0
"Nancy Pelosi has been the leader of the House Democrats for a very long time, and she is well-respected. However, in the wake of the shellacking the Democrats took during this election, there were strong rumblings that our party needs new leadership, and Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OHIO) thought he was the man to unseat Pelosi. That turned out not to be the case, though, and Pelosi retained her leadership position.Pelosi will be flanked by powerful House Democrats such as Rep. Jim Clyburn (R-SC) and Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) in her efforts to gain seats for the midterms. She was also backed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus. Many may argue that these are the reasons she won with 68 percent of the vote, but there are things folks do not generally know about the largely unknown Rep. Tim Ryan.This anonymity on the part of Rep. Ryan is important for a number of reasons. While, yes, Pelosi is a member of the Democratic old guard, she s also much more progressive than Tim Ryan could ever hope to be. Rep. Ryan has only been pro-choice for a little over a year, and it took a personal situation of his wife having a child that had potential problems to make him recognize the government should not be making those kinds of difficult and deeply personal decisions. It s just like what hypocritical Republicans do   they want to control everyone else s decisions in this area, but when it comes to their own lives, they do as they please. It s the ultimate in hypocrisy.This is unacceptable, as it really seems to be a matter of political convenience; after all, Democrats have been a pro-choice party for a very long time. If you re not pro-choice, you re not a real Democrat. You simply can t be. We re the party that fights FOR women s rights. We don t need anti-woman neanderthals in our ranks.Also, Pelosi is battle tested against the extremism of the House Republicans. We know that she will stand up to the bigoted agenda of the likes of Paul Ryan and his cronies. She won t let them strip away the rights of women, racial minorities, religious minorities, LGBTQ people, or anyone else. She also will not allow them to privatize medicare, deregulate the big banks, destroy Elizabeth Warren s Consumer Protection Bureau, or do any of the other horrific things the GOP is salivating over as we speak.Rep.

"BOSTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shareholder activists will speak with Chevron Corp (CVX.N) next week to request the energy giant use its influence with the government of Myanmar to press for a resolution of ethnic violence that has led to a refugee crisis. Joshua Brockwell, communications director for Azzad Asset Management, said the firm and other activist investors planned to press Chevron executives on Oct. 25 to discuss a letter they sent that also asked the company to consider cutting ties with  governments complicit in genocide.   Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, does business in Myanmar through a subsidiary, Unocal Myanmar Offshore Co Ltd. It has projects that include a minority interest in natural gas production and a pipeline, according to the company s website. Asked about Azzad s concerns, Chevron spokesman Melissa Ritchie said  Chevron conducts our business in a responsible manner, respecting the law and universal human rights to benefit the communities where we work, including Myanmar.   In our experience, peace, stability and the protection of human rights provide the best foundation for the economic development of a region and associated improvement in living conditions for communities,  she said via e-mail, confirming that the company would speak to the investors. More than 536,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape. [nL4N1MR38G] In September the United Nations  top human rights official accused Myanmar of conducting a  cruel military operation   against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, calling it  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.  Azzad s Brockwell said his firm was  growing increasingly concerned over the lack of a constructive response from Chevron  on its requests since the letter was sent, in August.  Brockwell said it might also file a shareholder resolution for Chevron s next annual meeting, similar to one Azzad and others filed for its 2017 meeting in May. That resolution called for a report evaluating whether Chevron should stop doing business with governments complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. The resolution received support from 6 percent of shares voted. In addition to Azzad, an Islamic finance firm, the other lead filer of the resolution was a Catholic religious order, the Ursuline Sisters of Tildonk. Simon Billenness, executive director of International Campaign for the Rohingya, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, said it planned to send similar letters to other companies doing business in Myanmar, signed by shareholders in those companies.

The violence and hate is astounding!How about her own mother s hateful rant to Union members admonishing them in a big way: Michigan State University students were delighted to hear that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a plan to relieve them of at least some of their massive college loan debts.The message was delivered Thursday night to a packed MSU Union lobby by the candidate s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, who s stumping for her mother in Michigan. Federal loans would automatically be set to the prevailing interest rate,  she said.  Right now Interest rates are low, and if we can renegotiate mortgages and our car loans we should be able to have our federal student loans set to the lowest rate. Clinton s speech lasted eight minutes without a mention of her mother s rival for the White House Republican nominee Donald Trump.But during a 20-minute question-and-answer period, she spoke of the rise in hate speech, the way it s cropped in with the election and in society as a whole. I never thought I would see in my lifetime   I certainly didn t think I d see it in my children s lifetime   all this normalization of hate speech that we re hearing from the Republican nominee,  she said to a woman asking about hate crime toward Muslims.Clinton criticized what she called rhetoric undisputed by the GOP against women, other races, people with disabilities, veterans and immigrants. That s not our country,  Clinton said,  and that s also what s at stake, the core values of our country. Read more: DFP",0
"Working in the service industry can really be a test, as you will eventually and inevitably come in contact with an impossibly difficult, insensitive customer that makes you question your faith in humanity. And if you haven t worked in the service industry, this story about a customer named Holly Jones will give you a pretty good idea of what a complete nightmare of a customer looks like.For New Year s Eve, Jones visited Kilroy s Bar N Grill in Indianapolis, Indiana   an experience that left her less than satisfied. Jones said that she and her party s experience was  ruined  due to the fact that she had to witness a dead person be wheeled out from an overdose.  And of course, because of this  dead person,  her table didn t get the attention she felt entitled to. Jones was so upset, that she took to Kilroy s Facebook page to blast the restaurant for making her holiday celebration so awful. She wrote: I will never go back to this location for New Year s Eve!!! After the way we were treated when we spent 700+ and having our meal ruined by watching a dead person being wheeled out from an overdose my night has been ruined!!! Every year we have come to Kilroys to enjoy New Years Eve and tonight we were screamed at and had the manager walk away from use while (we) were trying to figure out our bill being messed up.The manager also told us someone dying was more important than us being there making us feel like our business didn t matter, but I guess allowing a Junkie in the building to overdose on your property is more important than paying customers who are spending a lot of money!! Our waitress when we were trying to ask about our bill being messed up also said  what do you want me to do (expletive) pay your bill for you?  What a great way to talk to a paying customer! I get that working on New Years Eve (is) stressful but being a complete (expletive) to us all night knowing you get an automatic gratuity is not right!!! Kilroy sJones  bad review is awful enough, but it was Kilroy s response that made this incident gain widespread media attention. Kilroy manager Chris Burton replied to Jones and kindly informed her that the  dead person  who was  wheeled out from an overdose  was actually a 70-year-old woman who had suffered a heart attack while she was also celebrating NYE with her family. For Jones  insensitive remarks, Chris offered some harsh words of his own in return. First of all, the  overdosing junkie  that you speak of was a 70-year-old woman who had a heart attack. Thankfully she was revived at the hospital and survived. It sounds like you were very concerned about her so I thought you should know. This poor lady, who was celebrating New Year s Eve with her husband and son, had to be placed on the floor of a completely packed bar and have her shirt removed in front of everyone so the paramedics could work on her. You can read Burton s full post in the screenshots below, as he closed his post with I m glad to hear you won t be coming back to Kilroy s because we wouldn t want anyone as cold-hearted and nasty as you returning. Kilroy sKilroy sAfter Burton masterfully put Jones in her place, the incident went viral. In another post, Kilroy s reported that the victim who suffered a heart attack was stable, but still had a long way to recover. The bar set up a GoFundMe page, allowing supporters to donate in support of her recovery. The goal of the page was $5,000, but the donations have exceeded twice that amount. If there was one good thing that came out of Jones  nasty attitude and review, it was this   as one donor pointed out: I wonder if the lady who was upset realizes that her negativity has been a major blessing to this family .her anger and the subsequent comment from Kilroy s has lead to people learning about this gofundme and supporting this family. You are almost at the amount you requested in 17 hours. Without that woman, this incident could have happened all too quietly. Featured image via Google and Screenshots",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest lobbying organization for pharmaceutical companies began running TV ads on Monday morning to improve the industry’s image as criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump increases. The industry is touting developments in science by pharmaceutical companies and will spend “tens of millions” on television commercials, according to an announcement on Monday by officials of lobbying group PHRMA. A spokesman did not provide a specific amount.  Pharmaceutical companies may be facing their most difficult time ahead as criticism about the price of drugs continues to increase. In a news conference this month, Trump said drug manufacturers were “getting away with murder” because of their pricing.  Additionally, drug manufacturers were considered winners when the Affordable Care Act became law because more people had increased access to prescriptions. A repeal of the law often known as Obamacare could mean many people losing insurance could not afford to purchase drugs.  PHRMA CEO Stephen Ubl cast the “Go Boldly” campaign as an effort to refocus the discussion about the strides in research. But he acknowledged the industry was at the center of criticism. “We take the concerns that have been raised by the president very seriously,” Ubl said. “We think there are pragmatic policy solutions, and we look forward to working with the administration.” While outspoken while the Affordable Care Act was being drafted, PHRMA has largely remained quiet during the early discussions about whether the law should be repealed and replaced.  Planning for the group’s campaign began six months ago, well before the November presidential election, according to  spokesman Robert Zirkelbach.      Like many organizations, the group signaled it expected Democrat Hillary Clinton was going to win and began planning to push back at her calls for capping drug prices. It continued with plans for the campaign, which Ubl said would have been the same had Clinton won, even after Trump was elected.  The group also released a four-part regulatory and legislative agenda that it said would be part of an extensive lobbying campaign, including advocating for changes to the Food and Drug Administration and the ability for drugmakers to coordinate with insurance companies when developing new treatments. The campaign makes almost no mention of the repeal of Obamacare. “(This campaign) is not aimed at any one legislative issue,” Ubl said.  ",1
"There have been a lot of strange this that have happened this presidential election season, but some things are definitely stranger than others. One of those things being the fact that Rep. Steve King (R-IA) seems to know Sen. Ted Cruz s speeches by heart.Now, one could assume that it s because he s heard them so many times and Cruz doesn t change things up, so like a fan of a band he s mouthing the words. Another assumption could be made that perhaps he helped write the speech, so he s proudly mouthing the words along side his partner in conservative crime. However, probably the most accurate assumption would be that Ted Cruz is actually King s ventriloquist dummy and he s not doing a good job of hiding the movements of his mouth.Need proof? Watch this Vine: Now, this is still just a working theory, but it s one that makes the most sense, really. How else can one explain that they seem to be the same person in two different bodies. Albeit, one is Canadian and the other from Iowa.Need further proof?flickr/amazonI can t be the only one who sees this? How uncanny is that? I mean, c mon.However, I digress, maybe, just maybe, King should either practice his ventriloquism better, or learn to keep his mouth just so he doesn t appear to be a creeper in the background. Either choice would work.Video/Featured image from  Vine",0
"On Tuesday night, seven of the Bundy militants that were previously occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon were arrested by authorities. What started as a traffic stop devolved into a gunfight with the FBI, in which the  blue tarp man,  LaVoy Finicum, was killed. The five remaining militants with Bundy, one of whom was wounded but survived, were promptly arrested. There were two other militants that were arrested in separate incidents from the one that involved gunfire.That s when it seemed things suddenly became all too real for Ammon Bundy. He, along with his fellow rebels, was arraigned in federal court and held without bail while awaiting trial. The sudden realization of what was happening appeared to knock some sense into his head, prompting Ammon Bundy to call on the remaining militants at the refuge to surrender and leave the compound.Through attorney, Ammon Bundy is telling remaining occupiers in Burns to ""Go home. Hug your families. Let us take it from here.""  Jamie Wilson (@JWilsonreporter) January 27, 2016FBI Special Agent in Charge Greg Bretzing commented that the militants were given  ample opportunities  to leave the occupation peacefully.  Instead, they have chosen to threaten and intimidate the America they claim to love,  he said in a statement during a press conference regarding the arrests and shooting Wednesday.The remaining militants had previously made statements that they were going to resist arrest, with one of them recording a statement that he was going to die fighting while everyone was watching.A check on the militant s YouTube channel shows new video from the compound uploaded as of 1 hour ago at the time of approximately 8:15 pm EST on 1/27, with a live stream scheduled later. From videos uploaded previously, it seems that there is still a small group remaining on-site.Sheriff Dave Ward also made an emotional appeal for an end to the occupation:This has been tearing our community apart. It s time for everyone in this illegal occupation to move on. It doesn t have to be bloodshed in our community. If we have issues with the way things are going in our government, we have a responsibility as citizens to act on them in an appropriate manner. We don t arm up and rebel. We work through the appropriate channels.Source: opb.orgThere are only two ways to end this now. Hopefully the remaining few realize their lives are not worth throwing away.Featured image via flickr",0
"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The government of Somali will do all it can to pay salaries and buy equipment for its soldiers as it begins to lose international support, the country s president said on Monday. The statement came several days after Reuters reported that the United States was suspending food and fuel aid for most of Somalia s armed forces over corruption concerns. That announcement was a blow to the military, who will begin losing the support of African peacekeepers when they start to withdraw this month. Islamist insurgents are striking with ever-larger and more deadly attacks in the capital and major towns.  I hereby certify that if a thing is halted, as a government we shall put effort five hundred percent so that the suspension does not affect anyone, President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said in an address to military officials at the defense ministry that was broadcast on local radio.  Whether it is salary or equipment, the government will bring what it can, he said.  I am telling you that we should depend on ourselves. We thank the foreigners who were supporting us. If they mentioned criticism, we are required to rectify.  The president did not mention a specific donor s support, but added:  If you have someone who is ready to lend you a hand, you have to avoid things that can bring suspicion.  Reuters reported that the U.S. has grown frustrated that successive governments have failed to build a capable national army. Documents seen by Reuters paint a stark picture of a military hollowed out by corruption, unable to feed, pay or arm its soldiers, despite hundreds of millions of dollars of support. ",1
"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean hackers stole a large amount of classified military documents, including South Korea-U.S. wartime operational plans to wipe out the North Korean leadership, a South Korean ruling party lawmaker said on Wednesday. Democratic Party representative Rhee Cheol-hee said 235 gigabytes of military documents were taken from the Defense Integrated Data Center in September last year, citing information from unidentified South Korean defense officials. An investigative team inside the defense ministry announced in May the hack had been carried out by North Korea, but did not disclose what kind of information had been taken. Pyongyang has denied responsibility in its state media for the cyber attacks, criticizing Seoul for  fabricating  claims about online attacks. Separately on Wednesday, cyber security firm FireEye said in a statement North Korea-affiliated agents were detected attempting to phish U.S. electric companies through emails sent in mid-September, although those attempts did not lead to a disruption in the power supply. It did not specify when the attempts had been detected or clarify which companies had been affected. Rhee, currently a member of the National Assembly s committee for national defense, said about 80 percent of the hacked data had not yet been identified, but that none of the information was expected to have compromised the South Korean military because it was not top classified intelligence. Some of the hacked data addressed how to identify movements of members of the North Korean leadership, how to seal off their hiding locations, and attack from the air before eliminating them. Rhee said the North could not have taken the entire operation plans from the database because they had not been uploaded in full. These plans had likely not been classified properly but defense ministry officials told Rhee the hacked documents were not of top importance, he said.  Whatever the North Koreans took, we just need to fix the plans,  Rhee later told Reuters by telephone.  I disclosed this because the military hasn t been doing that fast enough.  Rhee said on radio the hack had been made possible by  a simple mistake  after a connector jack linking the military s intranet to the internet had not been eliminated after maintenance work had been done on the system.  The South Korean Defense Ministry s official stance is that they cannot confirm anything the lawmaker said about the hacked content due to the sensitivity of the matter.     In Washington, the Pentagon said it was aware of the media reports but would not comment on the potential breach.  Although I will not comment on intelligence matters or specific incidents related to cyber intrusion, I can assure you that we are confident in the security of our operations plans and our ability to deal with any threat from North Korea,  Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning told reporters. FireEye said the phishing attack on the electric companies detected was  early-stage reconnaissance  and did not indicate North Korea was about to stage an  imminent, disruptive  cyber attack. The North has been suspected of carrying out similar cyber attacks on South Korean electric utilities, in addition to other government and financial institutions. Those attempts were likely aimed at creating a means of  deterring potential war or sowing disorder during a time of armed conflict , FireEye said.  North Korea linked hackers are among the most prolific nation-state threats, targeting not only the U.S. and South Korea but the global financial system and nations worldwide,  its statement said.  Their motivations vary from economic enrichment to traditional espionage to sabotage, but all share the hallmark of an ascendant cyber power willing to violate international norms with little regard for potential blowback,  it said.

"Russian interference in our election should immediately disqualify Donald Trump from the presidency.On Friday, a CIA assessment found that the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies and officials is that Russia hacked our election system to not only hurt American confidence in our democratic institutions but to help Trump win against Hillary Clinton.According to the Washington Post,The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton s chances.This, of course, is a huge blow to Trump s legitimacy because he and his transition team have been strenuously insisting that Trump won by historic margins and that the country needs to unite behind him and kiss his ass. Now we know why.In response to the CIA report, Trump s team issued what amounts to a  nothing to see here, move along  statement, all while throwing intelligence officials under the bus. These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It s now time to move on and  Make America Great Again. In fact, most intelligence officials and agencies warned President Bush that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. So Trump just pushed a Bush Administration lie in order to hurt the credibility of our intelligence agencies.Also, Trump s  victory  is hardly one of the biggest in history. This is merely Trump trying to convince everyone that he s legitimate by exaggerating his election performance. The only problem is that we have the records from past elections. All of them. In just the last century alone, 18 other presidential election victories are bigger than Donald Trump s. That includes President Obama s victories in 2008 and 2012.Furthermore, Hillary Clinton is winning the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which Trump is desperately trying to undermine by claiming that 3 million people voted illegally.Evidence of Russian hacking is what originally caused activists to call for recounts late last month in three battleground states, including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. A recount in underway in Wisconsin while courts are preventing them in the other two as Green Party candidate Jill Stein continues to fight for election integrity.Now that our intelligence services have concluded that Russia DID hack our election in an effort to help Trump steal the election, it is more important than ever to make sure these recounts happen. In fact, they should happen in every state. Until then, Donald Trump should be considered an illegitimate president-elect.The fact that Trump and his team have been desperately trying to kill these recount effort is even more suspicious and gives the appearance that they are trying to hide something or prevent something from being discovered.Let s also not forget that Donald Trump himself encouraged Russia to continue hacking American institutions for his benefit. And they obeyed his request.This is a serious moment for our democracy. Allowing Trump to take office while ignoring the evidence that he cheated to win will only irrevocably damage American confidence in the integrity of our elections it will set a dangerous precedent. If Trump is allowed to get away with being aided by foreign agents, nothing stops Republicans or even Democrats from employing the same strategy in future elections. This needs to be stopped now before it it too late and the only way to do that is to stop Donald Trump from taking office and declaring Hillary Clinton the true victor.Impossible, you say? Not so fast. As it turns out, there is precedent for installing a defeated candidate when evidence of fraud is found. Huffington Post notes that a state Senate race in Pennsylvania was overturned and awarded to Republican Bruce Marks over Democrat William Stinson after real evidence of voter fraud was brought to light.Two of the elected officials who testified in the Pennsylvania case said under oath that they were aware of the fraud, had intentionally failed to enforce laws, and hurried to certify Stinson the winner in order to bury the story. The narrative recalls the Washington Post s revelation that Republican Mitch McConnell was aware of the CIA s conclusion that Russians had intervened and opted to do nothing.In the end, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court order that Marks be sworn in to fill the Senate seat.So not only could the courts restore election integrity by ordering Trump to step aside, they can install Hillary Clinton as the true President of the United States by citing Russian interference in the election. The Electoral College could intervene as well by not voting for Donald Trump on December 19th. They should vote for Clinton instead.The bottom line is that Donald Trump had outside help, which means he owes Russian a huge favor should he be allowed to take office. Russia would own him and that puts our nation at serious risk. Russian interference makes Trump illegitimate and he should be disqualified from holding office. If we really care about our democracy, this is what needs to be done.Featured Image: Mark Makela/Getty Images",0
" 21st Century Wire says The scandal emerged after it was revealed that Flynn had a conversation with a Russian Ambassador, Sergey I. Kislak, during the transition period before Trump took office, supposedly over the issue of US sanctions against Russia. It is believed that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence by not disclosing the full nature of these conversations.Flynn stated in a letter: In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors,  Flynn wrote.  These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude. Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with the incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology. This indiscretion was seen by many as an extreme beach of protocol  and a risk to national security. However, according to RT, Russian President Putin s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on Monday that Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss lifting sanctions.In addition to the potential of a protracted scandal on the White House side of this issue, there is also another potentially more important issue   about the fact that agents working the Obama Administration were tapping Flynn s telephone and also that agencies leaked related information which formed the press narrative of this scandal. If so, this would amount to a covert attack on the White House  from inside the US government.Flynn s departure could interrupt positive headway made on the bilateral START nuclear treaty with Russia which Flynn had been working on up until this week.In the interim, Trump has named a retired Lt. General, Joseph Keith Kellogg Jr, as Acting National Security Advisor, although it is believed that Vice Adm. Robert Harward, a former deputy commander at US CENTCOM in Tampa, FL is Trump s likely choice to replace Flynn.Another name in play is also General David Petraeus, although it s not certain that his record will be able to endure the aggressive media pressure that is certain to follow if appointed.The following a copy of Flynn s resignation lette r:Breaking: text of Flynn's resignation letter pic.twitter.com/KGue1cJFzL  Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 14, 2017READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump Files",0

The court s Establishment Clause analysis is fundamentally flawed and ignores the separation of powers. Worst of all, it puts our national security at risk.As the Supreme Court has rightly held, the United States Constitution is  not a suicide pact. As I explained earlier this week when we filed our amicus brief with the court in this case, the order in no way violates the Establishment Clause:First, the Executive Order (EO) does not even address religion, whatsoever. Second, the order has a secular purpose: our national security. As we explained: The EO, on its face, serves secular purposes, and no amount of rehashing of miscellaneous campaign trail commentary can change that. . . . [T]he mere suggestion of a possible religious or anti-religious motive, mined from past comments of a political candidate or his supporters, and intermixed with various secular purposes, is not enough to doom government action (along with all subsequent attempts to address the same subject matter).  [A]ll that Lemon requires  is that government action have  a secular purpose,  not that its purpose be  exclusively secular,  and a policy is invalid under this test only if it  was motivated wholly by religious considerations.  Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 680-81 & n.6 (1984) (emphasis added). The order singles out no religion for favor or disfavor. To conclude otherwise is unreasonable, and absurd. The six countries whose nationals are impacted by the pause were countries identified by President Obama and Congress as countries of particular concern. Policy disagreements, hurt feelings, and political agendas are not enough to support an Establishment Clause claim. The court s flawed order will invariably be appealed, and we will be ready to file crucial amicus briefs once again in federal appeals court.Read more: aclj",0
"(Reuters) - A Michigan judge on Tuesday dismissed charges against a former state representative, while ruling another lawmaker should stand trial after he tried to hide their extramarital affair, according to a prosecutor’s office spokeswoman. Ingham County District Judge Hugh Clarke ruled that former State Representative Todd Courser should stand trial for perjury  and one count of misconduct for his attempted cover-up of the affair with fellow lawmaker Cindy Gamrat, said Andrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for the Michigan attorney general’s office. Prosecutors originally charged Courser with three counts of misconduct while in office and perjury, but the judge dismissed two of the misconduct charges. Clarke also dismissed the two criminal misconduct-in-office charges against Gamrat due to insufficient evidence that she knowingly lied to House investigators about an email that Courser sent to distract from their affair, Bitely said. Prosecutors will not appeal the dismissed charges against Gamrat, but they are reviewing their options regarding the charges against Courser that were not sent to trial, Bitely said.  An attorney for Courser, Matthew DePerno, maintained his client is not guilty, and said he believed there was not enough evidence to support the perjury or misconduct charge. Courser is due back in court in late June.      A lawyer for Gamrat, Mike Nichols, said the charges against his client stem from a house investigation that arose from a political dispute. The former legislators faced charges of misconduct related to Courser’s failed attempt to cover up their affair. He had devised a plan to distribute an email falsely claiming he had sex with a male prostitute in a move meant to blunt the political impact of the actual affair if it was ever revealed, according to the Detroit News.  The two former lawmakers also were charged with misconduct for allowing their employees to forge their signature on proposed legislation. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if elected, the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the campaign said, marking a potential dramatic shift in U.S. policy.  During the meeting that lasted more than an hour at Trump Tower in New York, Trump told Netanyahu that under his administration, the United States would “recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel.” While Israel calls Jerusalem its capital, few other countries accept that, including the United States. Most nations maintain embassies in Tel Aviv.  Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in a 1967 war, as capital of the state they aim to establish alongside Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Netanyahu held a separate meeting later on Sunday that lasted just under an hour with Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump’s rival in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. Clinton emphasized her commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship and her plan to take the relationship to the next level, according to a statement from her campaign. She also talked about her commitment to a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict “that guarantees Israel’s future as a secure and democratic Jewish state with recognized borders and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity,” according to the statement. “Secretary Clinton reaffirmed her opposition to any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council,” the statement said. During the meeting with Trump, the Republican candidate’s campaign said he agreed with Netanyahu that peace in the Middle East could only be achieved when “the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.”  The Trump campaign said he and Netanyahu discussed “at length” Israel’s border fence, cited by Trump in reference to his own controversial immigration policies, which include building a wall on the U.S.- Mexico border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country. Other regional issues, including the fight against Islamic State, U.S. military assistance to Israel - “an excellent investment” - and the Iran nuclear deal, which both parties have criticized, were also discussed.

"If you listen to Donald Trump at any of his many rallies, you d think he made all of the products within his many, many product lines here in the good old U.S. of A. However, facts and reality tell a different story from the one currently pouring out of the orifice on the front of his face.As it turns out, Trump likes to save a few bucks himself and ship his manufacturing needs overseas. This, of course, killing jobs in the United States, but boosting jobs overseas. So, he s not lying when he says he ll put people to work, because he s been doing it in China, Peru, Bangladesh, etc. for years now. Too bad those jobs aren t here at home.Noticing the hypocrisy spewing out of Trump s mouth at nearly all of his rallies is none other than the Hillary Clinton campaign.

"LITTLE HOCKING, Ohio (Reuters) - While revelations that Donald Trump Jr. welcomed Russian help in last year’s presidential election roil Washington, asking about it along southern Ohio’s Appalachian Highway can draw some pretty strange looks. In the mostly rural, heavily Baptist and predominately Trump-supporting terrain, the collective reaction ranges from   ignorance about the Russia investigation, to a belief that some media want to destroy Republican President Donald Trump and his  family, to complete disinterest.  Many of the 20 people interviewed in several Ohio towns were dismissive of the barrage of headlines about a June 2016 meeting between Trump’s eldest son Donald Jr. and a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton. The revelation was made when Trump Jr. released a series of emails on Tuesday amid investigations of U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Moscow sought to help Trump win. Russia has denied allegations of interfering in the election and Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Russian officials, sometimes dismissing the notion as “fake news.” In Little Hocking, Ohio, Lisa Walker, 54, runs a small thrift shop. Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the American flag, she says her husband has expressed fears that somebody is going to try and assassinate Trump. She and her husband voted for Trump. She has followed the revelations about the younger Trump on the news. She sees the Russia investigation as proof that “people are out to get Trump. I would hope they have better things to do than play games and attack Trump.” Similarly, in Jackson and Piketon, Ohio, Donald Trump Jr.’s troubles appeared to strengthen support for his father and Trump family members who many in the area see as embattled victims. In Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County, the editor of the Hillsboro Times Gazette, Gary Abernathy, says many people in the county believe the media is trying to destroy Trump. “It just plays into the belief here that the media is fixated on all things Russia,” said Abernathy, whose newspaper was one of only six in the United States to have endorsed Trump for president during the election campaign. “I don’t mind Donald Trump being treated critically or aggressively, but not in a way that is an effort to drag him down. Donald Trump Jr. had one 20 minute meeting with a lawyer from Russia and it’s wall-to-wall coverage.” Trump won Highland County with more than 76 percent of the vote, 12 points more than the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won, part of a surge in votes for Trump in many Midwestern rural counties that was a significant factor in his victory. Donald Jr.’s meeting stirred more questions and reporting about possible collusion or whether any U.S. laws were broken. Under the U.S. Federal Election Campaign Act, it is illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a U.S. political campaign. Before the latest disclosures, Americans overall were  sharply divided on what to make of reports about Trump and Russia. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in June, 50 percent agreed “that President Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election” while 33 percent disagreed and the remainder were unsure. Republicans, however, mostly expressed the opposite view: 66 percent said they disagreed that Trump or his campaign worked with Russia while 20 percent agreed and the rest were unsure. In the Bob Evans diner in Jackson, three workers from Walmart were sitting down for lunch. They were Trump supporters. Asked about the Russia investigation, they stared back blankly. “I have never heard anything about it,” said Chastity Banks. Neither had her two colleagues. ",1
"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Thousands of Israelis protested in Tel Aviv on Saturday for the second consecutive week against government corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under criminal investigation over allegations of abuse of office. Police estimated the number of demonstrators at about 10,000 and they followed last Saturday s demonstration, which was by far the largest of the recent weekly anti-corruption protests when an estimated 20,000 people participated. The protests have been sparked by corruption allegations against Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing. The four-term leader is suspected of involvement in two cases.  The first involves receiving gifts from wealthy businessmen and the second involves negotiating a deal with a newspaper owner for better coverage in return for curbs on a rival daily. If charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate to govern. Netanyahu s right-wing Likud party said in a Facebook post that the protest was a left-wing demonstration. It called on all Israelis to back their prime minister as he defends Israel against international criticism following U.S. President Donald Trump s acceptance of Jerusalem as Israel s capital.  Instead of uniting with all the people behind Jerusalem and showing the world a unified front, the left cannot contain itself and it prefers to create division,  part of the statement said. Over weeks of demonstrations, protesters have identified themselves as supporting both left- and right-wing parties. On Saturday they held banners reading:  Neither left, nor right (we demand) integrity,   We are fed up with corrupt (politicians)  and  Sweep the corrupt away.  ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department will not conduct its regular daily press briefing until a new secretary of state is confirmed, leaving the main U.S. agency responsible for dealing with the rest of the world silent amid the uproar over President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration. Trump on Friday announced a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and a temporary bar on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. The decision provoked a widespread backlash in foreign capitals, documented in cables U.S. embassies sent to Washington. Typically, in the aftermath of a major foreign policy shift, a State Department spokesperson would appear on camera within days to take questions from reporters and defend or explain the U.S. positions on different issues. The State Department has not briefed since the day before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, however, and on Monday a department spokesperson said no one will appear at the podium until the U.S. Senate confirms a new secretary of state. “At that point, we will update the press corps on our posture,” the spokesperson said. Trump’s desire to break with previous U.S. policies on issues including Israel’s construction of settlements, U.S. trade pacts, and cooperation with Russia suggests that State Department officials have not been given guidance on what positions they should articulate.     “Until you know what policy you’re advancing, it doesn’t do you any good to get out there,” said Richard Boucher, a former State Department spokesman who briefed reporters on the first weekday of the George W. Bush administration, in January 2001. “The decision not to brief is a simple admission that they don’t know what to say.” The Senate is due to vote on Monday on moving forward on confirming Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil Corp executive whom Trump has tapped to lead the State Department.   If as expected the Senate votes to advance his nomination, a final confirmation vote would most likely take place late on Tuesday. The lack of briefings this far into a new administration is a departure from the three previous inter-party transitions. In 1993, 2001, and 2009, State Department spokespeople briefed reporters no later than Jan. 23, according to briefing transcripts stored in online archives. In those three transitions, the new secretary of state was confirmed on or just after Jan. 20. ",1

"This story should send chills down the spine of every American. Communism is on our doorstep THEY CAME WITH A BATTERING RAM. Cindy Archer, one of the lead architects of Wisconsin s Act 10   also called the  Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill,  it limited public-employee benefits and altered collective-bargaining rules for public-employee unions   was jolted awake by yelling, loud pounding at the door, and her dogs  frantic barking. The entire house   the windows and walls   was shaking.She looked outside to see up to a dozen police officers, yelling to open the door. They were carrying a battering ram. She wasn t dressed, but she started to run toward the door, her body in full view of the police. Some yelled at her to grab some clothes, others yelled for her to open the door. I was so afraid,  she says.  I did not know what to do.  She grabbed some clothes, opened the door, and dressed right in front of the police. The dogs were still frantic. I begged and begged,  Please don t shoot my dogs, please don t shoot my dogs, just don t shoot my dogs.  I couldn t get them to stop barking, and I couldn t get them outside quick enough. I saw a gun and barking dogs. I was scared and knew this was a bad mix.  She got the dogs safely out of the house, just as multiple armed agents rushed inside.Some even barged into the bathroom, where her partner was in the shower. The officer or agent in charge demanded that Cindy sit on the couch, but she wanted to get up and get a cup of coffee.  I told him this was my house and I could do what I wanted.  Wrong thing to say.  This made the agent in charge furious. He towered over me with his finger in my face and yelled like a drill sergeant that I either do it his way or he would handcuff me. They wouldn t let her speak to a lawyer.She looked outside and saw a person who appeared to be a reporter. Someone had tipped him off. The neighbors started to come outside, curious at the commotion, and all the while the police searched her house, making a mess, and   according to Cindy   leaving her  dead mother s belongings strewn across the basement floor in a most disrespectful way. Then they left, carrying with them only a cellphone and a laptop.Here is a videotaped interview of a neighbor who witnessed the police invasion of her home: IT S A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH.  That was the first thought of  Anne  (not her real name).Someone was pounding at her front door. It was early in the morning   very early   and it was the kind of heavy pounding that meant someone was either fleeing from   or bringing   trouble.  It was so hard. I d never heard anything like it. I thought someone was dying outside. She ran to the door, opened it, and then chaos.  People came pouring in. For a second I thought it was a home invasion. It was terrifying. They were yelling and running, into every room in the house. One of the men was in my face, yelling at me over and over and over. It was indeed a home invasion, but the people who were pouring in were Wisconsin law-enforcement officers. Armed, uniformed police swarmed into the house. Plainclothes investigators cornered her and her newly awakened family.Soon, state officials were seizing the family s personal property, including each person s computer and smartphone, filled with the most intimate family information.Why were the police at Anne s home? She had no answers. The police were treating them the way they d seen police treat drug dealers on television. In fact, TV or movies were their only points of reference, because they weren t criminals. They were law-abiding. They didn t buy or sell drugs. They weren t violent. They weren t a danger to anyone. Yet there were cops   surrounding their house on the outside, swarming the house on the inside.They even taunted the family as if they were mere  perps. As if the home invasion, the appropriation of private property, and the verbal abuse weren t enough, next came ominous warnings.Don t call your lawyer. Don t tell anyone about this raid. Not even your mother, your father, or your closest friends.The entire neighborhood could see the police around their house, but they had to remain silent. This was not the  right to remain silent  as uttered by every cop on every legal drama on television   the right against self-incrimination.They couldn t mount a public defense if they wanted   or even offer an explanation to family and friends. Yet no one in this family was a  perp. Instead, like Cindy, they were American citizens guilty of nothing more than exercising their First Amendment rights to support Act 10 and other conservative causes in Wisconsin. Sitting there shocked and terrified, this citizen   who is still too intimidated to speak on the record   kept thinking,  Is this America? THEY FOLLOWED ME TO MY KIDS  ROOMS.  For the family of  Rachel  (not her real name), the ordeal began before dawn   with the same loud, insistent knocking. Still in her pajamas, Rachel answered the door and saw uniformed police, poised to enter her home.When Rachel asked to wake her children herself, the officer insisted on walking into their rooms. The kids woke to an armed officer, standing near their beds. The entire family was herded into one room, and there they watched as the police carried off their personal possessions, including items that had nothing to do with the subject of the search warrant   even her daughter s computer.And, yes, there were the warnings. Don t call your lawyer. Don t talk to anyone about this. Don t tell your friends.The kids watched   alarmed   as the school bus drove by, with the students inside watching the spectacle of uniformed police surrounding the house, carrying out the family s belongings. Yet they were told they couldn t tell anyone at school. They, too, had to remain silent.The mom watched as her entire life was laid open before the police. Her professional files, her personal files, everything. She knew this was all politics. She knew a rogue prosecutor was targeting her for her political beliefs. And she realized,  Every aspect of my life is in their hands. And they hate me. Fortunately for her family, the police didn t taunt her or her children. Some of them seemed embarrassed by what they were doing. At the end of the ordeal, one officer looked at the family, still confined to one room, and said,  Some days, I hate my job. For dozens of conservatives, the years since Scott Walker s first election as governor of Wisconsin transformed the state   known for pro-football championships, good cheese, and a population with a reputation for being unfailingly polite   into a place where conservatives have faced early-morning raids, multi-year secretive criminal investigations, slanderous and selective leaks to sympathetic media, and intrusive electronic snooping.Yes, Wisconsin, the cradle of the progressive movement and home of the  Wisconsin idea    the marriage of state governments and state universities to govern through technocratic reform   was giving birth to a new progressive idea, the use of law enforcement as a political instrument, as a weapon to attempt to undo election results, shame opponents, and ruin lives.Most Americans have never heard of these raids, or of the lengthy criminal investigations of Wisconsin conservatives. For good reason. Bound by comprehensive secrecy orders, conservatives were left to suffer in silence as leaks ruined their reputations, as neighbors, looking through windows and dismayed at the massive police presence, the lights shining down on targets  homes, wondered, no doubt, What on earth did that family do?This was the on-the-ground reality of the so-called John Doe investigations, expansive and secret criminal proceedings that directly targeted Wisconsin residents because of their relationship to Scott Walker, their support for Act 10, and their advocacy of conservative reform.Largely hidden from the public eye, this traumatic process, however, is now heading toward a legal climax, with two key rulings expected in the late spring or early summer.The first ruling, from the Wisconsin supreme court, could halt the investigations for good, in part by declaring that the  misconduct  being investigated isn t misconduct at all but the simple exercise of First Amendment rights.The second ruling, from the United States Supreme Court, could grant review on a federal lawsuit brought by Wisconsin political activist Eric O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth, the first conservatives to challenge the investigations head-on.If the Court grants review, it could not only halt the investigations but also begin the process of holding accountable those public officials who have so abused their powers.But no matter the outcome of these court hearings, the damage has been done. In the words of Mr. O Keefe,  The process is the punishment. UPDATED VIDEO INTERVIEW WITH BLAZE TV s DANA LOESCH:It all began innocently enough. In 2009, officials from the office of the Milwaukee County executive contacted the office of the Milwaukee district attorney, headed by John Chisholm, to investigate the disappearance of $11,242.24 from the Milwaukee chapter of the Order of the Purple Heart.The matter was routine, with witnesses willing and able to testify against the principal suspect, a man named Kevin Kavanaugh.What followed, however, was anything but routine. Chisholm failed to act promptly on the report, and when he did act, he refused to conduct a conventional criminal investigation but instead petitioned, in May 2010, to open a  John Doe  investigation, a proceeding under Wisconsin law that permits Wisconsin officials to conduct extensive investigations while keeping the target s identity secret (hence the designation  John Doe ).John Doe investigations alter typical criminal procedure in two important ways: First, they remove grand juries from the investigative process, replacing the ordinary citizens of a grand jury with a supervising judge.Second, they can include strict secrecy requirements not just on the prosecution but also on the targets of the investigation. In practice, this means that, while the prosecution cannot make public comments about the investigation, it can take public actions indicating criminal suspicion (such as raiding businesses and homes in full view of the community) while preventing the targets of the raids from defending against or even discussing the prosecution s claims.Why would Chisholm seek such broad powers to investigate a year-old embezzlement claim with a known suspect? Because the Milwaukee County executive, Scott Walker, had by that time become the leading Republican candidate for governor. District Attorney Chisholm was a Democrat, a very partisan Democrat.Almost immediately after opening the John Doe investigation, Chisholm used his expansive powers to embarrass Walker, raiding his county-executive offices within a week.As Mr. O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth explained in court filings, the investigation then dramatically expanded: Over the next few months, [Chisholm s] investigation of all-things-Walker expanded to include everything from alleged campaign-finance violations to sexual misconduct to alleged public contracting bid-rigging to alleged misuse of county time and property.Between May 5, 2010, and May 3, 2012, the Milwaukee Defendants filed at least eighteen petitions to formally  [e]nlarge  the scope of the John Doe investigation, and each was granted. . .That amounts to a new formal inquiry every five and a half weeks, on average, for two years.This expansion coincided with one of the more remarkable state-level political controversies in modern American history   the protest (and passage) of Act 10, followed by the attempted recall of a number of Wisconsin legislators and, ultimately, Governor Walker.Political observers will no doubt remember the events in Madison   the state capitol overrun by chanting protesters, Democratic lawmakers fleeing the state to prevent votes on the legislation, and tens of millions of dollars of outside money flowing into the state as Wisconsin became, fundamentally, a proxy fight pitting the union-led Left against the Tea Party led economic Right.At the same time that the public protests were raging, so were private   but important   protests in the Chisholm home and workplace.As a former prosecutor told journalist Stuart Taylor, Chisholm s wife was a teachers -union shop steward who was distraught over Act 10 s union reforms. He said Chisholm  felt it was his personal duty  to stop them. Meanwhile, according to this whistleblower, the district attorney s offices were festooned with the  blue fist  poster of the labor-union movement, indicating that Chisholm s employees were very much invested in the political fight.In the end, the John Doe proceeding failed in its ultimate aims. It secured convictions for embezzlement (related to the original 2009 complaint), a conviction for sexual misconduct, and a few convictions for minor campaign violations, but Governor Walker was untouched, his reforms were implemented, and he survived his recall election. But with another election looming   this time Walker s campaign for reelection   Chisholm wasn t finished.He launched yet another John Doe investigation,  supervised  by Judge Barbara Kluka. Kluka proved to be capable of superhuman efficiency   approving  every petition, subpoena, and search warrant in the case  in a total of one day s work.If the first series of John Doe investigations was  everything Walker,  the second series was  everything conservative,  as Chisholm had launched an investigation of not only Walker (again) but the Wisconsin Club for Growth and dozens of other conservative organizations, this time fishing for evidence of allegedly illegal  coordination  between conservative groups and the Walker campaign.In the second John Doe, Chisholm had no real evidence of wrongdoing. Yes, conservative groups were active in issue advocacy, but issue advocacy was protected by the First Amendment and did not violate relevant campaign laws.Nonetheless, Chisholm persuaded prosecutors in four other counties to launch their own John Does, with Judge Kluka overseeing all of them.Empowered by a rubber-stamp judge, partisan investigators ran amok. They subpoenaed and obtained (without the conservative targets  knowledge) massive amounts of electronic data, including virtually all the targets  personal e-mails and other electronic messages from outside e-mail vendors and communications companies.The investigations exploded into the open with a coordinated series of raids on October 3, 2013. These were home invasions, including those described above. Chisholm s office refused to comment on the raid tactics (or any other aspect of the John Doe investigations), but witness accounts regarding the two John Doe investigations are remarkably similar: early-morning intrusions, police rushing through the house, and stern commands to remain silent and tell no one about what had occurred.At the same time, the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative organizations received broad subpoenas requiring them to turn over virtually all business records, including  donor information, correspondence with their associates, and all financial information.  The subpoenas also contained dire warnings about disclosure of their existence, threatening contempt of court if the targets spoke publicly.For select conservative families across five counties, this was the terrifying moment   the moment they felt at the mercy of a truly malevolent state.Speaking both on and off the record, targets reflected on how many layers of Wisconsin government failed their fundamental constitutional duties   the prosecutors who launched the rogue investigations, the judge who gave the abuse judicial sanction, investigators who chose to taunt and intimidate during the raids, and those police who ultimately approved and executed aggressive search tactics on law-abiding, peaceful citizens.For some of the families, the trauma of the raids, combined with the stress and anxiety of lengthy criminal investigations, has led to serious emotional repercussions.  Devastating  is how Anne describes the impact on her family.  Life-changing,  she says.  All in terrible ways. O Keefe, who has been in contact with multiple targeted families, says,  Every family I know of that endured a home raid has been shaken to its core, and the fate of marriages and families still hangs in the balance in some cases. Anne also describes a new fear of the police:  I used to support the police, to believe they were here to protect us. Now, when I see an officer, I ll cross the street. I m afraid of them. I know what they re capable of.  Cindy says,  I lock my doors and I close my shades. I don t answer the door unless I am expecting someone. My heart races when I see a police car sitting in front of my house or following me in the car.The raid was so public. I ve been harassed. My house has been vandalized. [She did not identify suspects.] I no longer feel safe, and I don t think I ever will. Rachel talks about the effect on her children.  I tried to create a home where the kids always feel safe. Now they know they re not. They know men with guns can come in their house, and there s nothing we can do.  Every knock on the door brings anxiety. Every call to the house is screened. In the back of her mind is a single, unsettling thought: These people will never stop.Victims of trauma   and every person I spoke with described the armed raids as traumatic   often need to talk, to share their experiences and seek solace in the company of a loving family and supportive friends. The investigators denied them that privilege, and it compounded their pain and fear. The investigation not only damaged families, it also shut down their free speech. In many cases, the investigations halted conservative groups in their tracks.O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth described the effect in court filings: O Keefe s associates began cancelling meetings with him and declining to take his calls, reasonably fearful that merely associating with him could make them targets of the investigation.O Keefe was forced to abandon fundraising for the Club because he could no longer guarantee to donors that their identities would remain confidential, could not (due to the Secrecy Order) explain to potential donors the nature of the investigation, could not assuage donors  fears that they might become targets themselves, and could not assure donors that their money would go to fund advocacy rather than legal expenses.The Club was also paralyzed. Its officials could not associate with its key supporters, and its funds were depleted. It could not engage in issue advocacy for fear of criminal sanction.These raids and subpoenas were often based not on traditional notions of probable cause but on mere suspicion, untethered to the law or evidence, and potentially violating the Fourth Amendment s prohibition against  unreasonable searches and seizures.  The very existence of First Amendment protected expression was deemed to be evidence of illegality.The prosecution simply assumed that the conservatives were incapable of operating within the bounds of the law. Even worse, many of the investigators  legal theories, even if proven by the evidence, would not have supported criminal prosecutions. In other words, they were investigating  crimes  that weren t crimes at all.If the prosecutors had applied the same legal standards to the Democrats in their own offices, they would have been forced to turn the raids on themselves. If the prosecutors and investigators had been raided, how many of their computers and smartphones would have contained incriminating information indicating use of government resources for partisan purposes?With the investigations now bursting out into the open, some conservatives began to fight back. O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth moved to quash the John Doe subpoenas aimed at them.In a surprise move, Judge Kluka, who had presided over the Doe investigations for more than a year, recused herself from the case. (A political journal, the Wisconsin Reporter, attempted to speak to Judge Kluka about her recusal, but she refused to offer comment.)The new judge in the case, Gregory Peterson, promptly sided with O Keefe and blocked multiple subpoenas, holding (in a sealed opinion obtained by the Wall Street Journal, which has done invaluable work covering the John Doe investigations) that they  do not show probable cause that the moving parties committed any violations of the campaign finance laws. The judge noted that  the State is not claiming that any of the independent organizations expressly advocated  Walker s election. O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth followed up Judge Peterson s ruling by filing a federal lawsuit against Chisholm and a number of additional defendants, alleging multiple constitutional violations, including a claim that the investigation constituted unlawful retaliation against the plaintiffs for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.United States District Court judge Rudolph Randa promptly granted the plaintiffs  motion for a preliminary injunction, declaring that  the Defendants must cease all activities related to the investigation, return all property seized in the investigation from any individual or organization, and permanently destroy all copies of information and other materials obtained through the investigation. From that point forward, the case proceeded on parallel state and federal tracks. At the federal level, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Randa s order.Declining to consider the case on the merits, the appeals court found the lawsuit barred by the federal Anti-Injunction Act, which prohibits federal courts from issuing injunctions against some state-court proceedings.O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth have petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari and expect a ruling in a matter of weeks.At the same time, the John Doe prosecutors took their case to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals to attempt to restart the Doe proceedings. The case was ultimately consolidated before the state supreme court, with a ruling also expected in a matter of weeks.And so, almost five years after their secret beginning, the John Doe proceedings are nearly dead   on  life support,  according to one Wisconsin pundit   but incalculable damage has been done, to families, to activist organizations, to the First Amendment, and to the rule of law itself.In international law, the Western world has become familiar with a concept called  lawfare,  a process whereby rogue regimes or organizations abuse legal doctrines and processes to accomplish through sheer harassment and attrition what can t be accomplished through legitimate diplomatic means. The Palestinian Authority and its defenders have become adept at lawfare, putting Israel under increasing pressure before the U.N. and other international bodies.The John Doe investigations are a form of domestic lawfare, and our constitutional system is ill equipped to handle it. Federal courts rarely intervene in state judicial proceedings, state officials rarely lose their array of official immunities for the consequences of their misconduct, and violations of First Amendment freedoms rarely result in meaningful monetary damages for the victims.As Scott Walker runs for president, the national media will finally join the Wall Street Journal in covering John Doe.Given the mainstream media s typical bias and bad faith, they are likely to bring a fresh round of pain to the targets of the investigation; the cloud of suspicion will descend once again; even potential favorable court rulings by either the state supreme court or the U.S. Supreme Court will be blamed on  conservative justices  taking care of their own.Conservatives have looked at Wisconsin as a success story, where Walker took everything the Left threw at him and emerged victorious in three general elections. He broke the power of the teachers  unions and absorbed millions upon millions of dollars of negative ads. The Left kept chanting,  This is what democracy looks like,  and in Wisconsin, democracy looked like Scott Walker winning again and again.Yet in a deeper way, Wisconsin is anything but a success. There were casualties left on the battlefield   innocent citizens victimized by a lawless government mob, public officials who brought the full power of their office down onto the innocent.Governors come and go. Statutes are passed and repealed. Laws and elections are important, to be sure, but the rule of law is more important still. And in Wisconsin, the rule of law hangs in the balance   along with the liberty of citizens.As I finished an interview with one victim still living in fear, still shattered by the experience of nearly losing everything simply because she supported the wrong candidate at the wrong time, I asked whether she had any final thoughts.  Just one,  she replied.  I m hoping for accountability, that someone will be held responsible so that they ll never do this again.  She paused for a moment and then, with voice trembling, said:  No one should ever endure what my family endured. Via: National Review",0
"LIMA (Reuters) - Villagers in the Peruvian Amazon have shut down at least 50 oil wells operated by Frontera Energy Corp to protest talks over a new contract even as past pollution lingers, the leader of an indigenous federation said on Wednesday. Some 600 members of native Achuar communities in the Corrientes River basin seized the wells on Monday along with an electric plant and oil tanks used by the Canadian company in Block 192, the country s biggest oilfield, said Carlos Sandi, president of the Feconacor federation. The latest protest in a region long plagued by complaints of oil pollution came after the center-right government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski declined to apply an indigenous rights law as it negotiates with Frontera. The so-called prior consultation law, passed in 2011, requires the government to seek input from indigenous people before approving development plans that might affect them. The growing indigenous anger threatens to disrupt Frontera s plans to keep operating in Peru after its two-year contract expires. Frontera has been negotiating a long-term contract for Block 192 with state energy regulator Perupetro. Tribal leaders had warned they would forcibly halt oil operations there unless their demands were taken into account through prior consultation. Communities in Block 192 mainly want past oil pollution cleaned up and better access to education and healthcare, Sandi said. Frontera, which has operated Block 192 for the past two years, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Protests could expand into other parts of Block 192 as Quechua villagers readied plans to seize 16 additional oil wells and an airport in the Pastaza River basin on Thursday, said Aurelio Chino, president of the indigenous federation Fediquep. Peru s Culture Ministry, charged with protecting indigenous rights, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Last week, the ministry rejected the communities  request for prior consultation, but said the government might reconsider if new measures regarding Block 192 were implemented. Block 192 in Peru s Loreto region produced about 9,500 barrels of oil per day in August, according to official data. ",1

"WUKAN, China (Reuters) - Surveillance cameras peer at residents from every major street corner. Informants are everywhere, villagers say. And more than a dozen villagers are languishing in prison or detention. The southern Chinese village of Wukan was once a symbol of grassroots democracy in China. Now, a year after the authorities quelled protests over land grabs and the jailing of a local leader, Wukan is locked in a stifling security squeeze. A rare visit to Wukan by a Reuters team and interviews with half a dozen villagers and sources familiar with the situation revealed that the village and surrounding area remain tightly policed as the government tries to maintain security at all costs. Villagers in Wukan once warmly welcomed the media, but many are now afraid of speaking for fear of reprisals.  There s nothing left here,  said one young man in Wukan who was edgy and wouldn t talk for long.  You know what happened,  he added before moving quickly away.  The sources said that a provincial-level  Wukan Mass Working Group  had been set up with about 100 full-time personnel and charged with ensuring  stability  by marshalling a network of informers, security patrols, surveillance systems and floodlights in the village. In the 1980s, the Chinese government began allowing elections in villages nationwide, although democracy activists say the votes for village committees were rarely free from official influence.  But after a series of protests against local officials in Wukan in 2011, when government offices were ransacked, authorities eventually backed down, allowing the village to hold open elections that became a beacon for democratic hope in China. But now, Wukan, once famous in China as the  democracy village , has succumbed to China s tightening grip over civil society and individual rights, said Zhuang Liehong, a former Wukan protest leader who helped lead an uprising against local authorities in 2011.  What is happening in Wukan is what is happening in China,  said Zhuang.  It s a dark reflection of China, with no freedom of expression. No individual rights.  There was no immediate response from the Guangdong provincial government to faxed questions from Reuters seeking comment. Under President Xi Jinping, the government has intensified efforts to deepen the reach of the Communist Party into all aspects of life in China. Critics say it brooks no dissent, and has been cracking down on civil society, which it sees as a challenge to central authority.  When Xi took the reins in 2013, repressing boundary-pushers in civil society was a cornerstone of his political campaign to consolidate power,  Diana Fu of the University of Toronto and Greg Distelhorst of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote in an academic paper on  Grassroots Participation and Repression in Contemporary China . With China s recent leadership transition further consolidating Xi s power, the next five years will likely see a continuation of tough social stability policies that will have an impact on places like Wukan, some analysts say.  The party has decided to double down on authoritarianism after the problems they ve faced,  said Nicolas Bequelin, Amnesty International s director for East Asia. During the 2011 protests, Zhuang helped barricade the coastal hamlet of 15,000 people against battalions of riot police. He spoke by telephone with Reuters from New York, where he is now in exile after leaving Wukan in 2014. Wukan sits in a picturesque region flanked by hills and a deep water harbor, with lush farmland, ponds teeming with fish and shrimp, and the occasional flash of kingfishers.  Its troubles began in the 1990s when swathes of farmland began being sold off to property developers by the village leadership in a series of opaque deals. In 2011, these problems came to a head, when many villagers began demanding that the land be returned.   A months-long insurrection against local authorities and riot police put a global media spotlight on Wukan, leading to a rare populist victory in Communist China when the provincial authorities eventually backed down.   The village committee at the center of the land deals was removed and a free election was allowed that saw all seven of the protest leaders voted into public office. This village committee soon came under pressure from allies of the old leadership seeking retribution, they said. Over the course of the next few years most of the protest organizers left public office, including their leader, Lin Zuluan, who was jailed for corruption last summer. The protests last year erupted after villagers demanded Lin s release. Many villagers say the charges were concocted and that a confession by Lin on state television was forced. The protests ran for several months and were quelled by hundreds of riot police firing rubber bullets, hurling tear gas and beating up villagers with batons, victims and witnesses told Reuters at the time. Last December, the People s Court of nearby Haifeng town, which oversees Wukan, sentenced nine villagers to jail terms ranging from two to nine years for a number of charges including illegal assembly, disrupting traffic and spreading false information, according to a notice on its website. There was no immediate response to a Reuters request for comment from the Lufeng government, which has jurisdiction over Haifeng and Wukan.   One villager, Zhang Bingchai, was jailed for two years for allegedly spreading false information, the court said. Two acquaintances who knew him said he had spoken about the situation in Wukan, to outsiders on his mobile phone and had posted some images of the crackdown. Zhuang said his 67-year-old father, Zhuang Songkun, was jailed for three years on a charge of gathering a crowd to block traffic during the protests. The hard line against the protests reflects the government s desire to ensure stability, said Xiong Wei, the founder of New Enlightenment, a village advocacy organization in Beijing who has visited Wukan on numerous occasions.    And they ve been very successful,  said Xiong.  No one dares raise their head. But the problems haven t been resolved,  he added, referring to the land seizures. Beyond a checkpoint manned by paramilitary police with guns, the main road into Wukan is now lined with giant billboards and colorful flags projecting a new narrative of stability and peace. Propaganda billboards and posters were also displayed around town.  Advance solidly to execute the strategy of loving the people,  read one, illustrated with a flock of doves flying over uniformed officers clutching rifles as they look across toward a portrait of Mao in Beijing s Tiananmen Square.  Police and the people build a harmonious and civilized Wukan together,  it read. Another sign urged a  New Ethos . Beneath the surface, however, resentment lingers amongst those who spoke to Reuters.  Wukan has reached a dead end now,  said one villager.  People won t do anything.  Back in New York, Zhuang, the exiled former Wukan protest leader, said he ll keep speaking out.   He said his mother has been harassed and his house surveilled with cameras. Visitors to his house have been questioned and several detained, he said. His assertions could not be independently confirmed. All of the other former Wukan protest leaders have since quit their posts, been jailed, or harassed, he said.  Besides me, there are no voices left. It is silent now.  ",1

"The Obama family ended their eight-year residency at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on Friday, as the former first couple bid a temporary farewell to the nation s capital following Donald Trump s swearing-in ceremony.The Obamas stood with President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, before walking down in unison toward a Marine helicopter. The two couples exchanged pleasantries, before the Obamas boarded the helicopter for the quick hop to Joint Base Andrews, where daughters Malia and Sasha awaited along with the Air Force jet that, for the next four years, will only be known as Air Force One when Trump is on board.Barack Obama addressed the crowd after their arrival at Andrews, and joked that  Michelle and I, we ve really been milking this goodbye thing, so it behooves me to be very brief. He then circled back to his campaign message of hope:  Throughout it was infused with a sense of hope   It wasn t blind optimism that drove you to do all this work, it wasn t naivet    it was hope in the face of difficulty.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Outgoing CIA Director John Brennan has said it would be the “height of folly” for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to tear up Washington’s deal with Tehran because it would make it more likely that Iran and others would acquire nuclear weapons. “It could lead to a weapons program inside of Iran that could lead other states in the region to embark on their own programs,” Brennan said in an interview with the BBC aired on Wednesday.  “So I think it would be the height of folly if the next administration were to tear up that agreement.” Brennan also said that in dealing with the Syrian crisis, Trump should be cautious in trying to work with Russia. “I hope there is going to be an improvement in relations between Washington and Moscow,” he said. “President-elect Trump and the new administration need to be wary of Russian promises. Russian promises in my mind have not given us what it is that they have pledged.” ",1
"A vicious new law in Arkansas proves that Republicans are on the side of rapists.Two months ago, Republicans fast-tracked a brand new anti-abortion bill through the legislature and Governor Asa Hutchinson signed it last week.Arkansas Act 45 bans the most common and safest abortion procedure available to women known as dilation and evacuation, which is used for abortions performed during the second trimester. That means Arkansas Republicans are openly defying the framework set up by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade which says states can t interfere with a woman s right to choose until the fetus becomes viable. 50 percent viability rate is achieved at 24 to 25 weeks. But the new law would ban safe abortions after 14 weeks and creates a burden for women because it forces them to choose less safe options to end their pregnancies.Doctors who perform the abortion procedure would be charged with a felony that carries a $10,000 fine or six years in prison.But the bill also has a terrifying clause that rapists are going to love.The bill gives rapists the power to deny their victims an abortion if they sue the abortion provider.According to The Daily Beast,A clause in the Arkansas law allows a woman s spouse, parent or guardian, or health care provider to sue an abortion provider for civil damages or injunctive relief that could stop the abortion. And because Act 45 does not provide any exceptions for cases of rape or incest, the clause could allow the fetus s father to sue an abortion provider even in cases of spousal rape or incest.Some lawmakers, like Democratic state Senator Will Bond, had a problem with the bill because the way it is drafted seems to allow any family member of the pregnant woman to file a lawsuit to stop the abortion and could actually end up severely disabling women who are forced to choose a riskier abortion procedure. There is an injunctive relief section in the bill that, in my reading of it, would seem to allow litigation among family members. If one spouse sought injunctive relief to prevent a certain procedure, or possibly other family members have the possibility for injunctive relief, that was a concern of mine. There is an exception for women s health in the bill, but it required irreparable harm [to the point of] permanent disability of a woman. The way it was drafted, I had concerns that the women s health exception is way too narrow, and there s no exception for rape and incest. The fact that rapists have a new tool to use to torture their victims is totally unacceptable and demonstrates that Republicans are totally anti-woman.Of course, these kinds of bills have been blocked in other states, so it s likely this one will be blocked from going into effect as well. But women cannot rely on the courts to protects their rights. They need to vote and kick Republicans out of office if they truly want to guarantee that government will not try to dictate what decisions they make about their own bodies.Featured image via Woman Survival",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative activist groups that generally support Republicans but oppose a pro-export, anti-import Republican tax proposal, released a study on Thursday estimating its impact on individual U.S. states, underscoring the party’s division over taxes. With taxes at the top of Republican priorities, the two groups, backed by the wealthy Koch brothers, reported that seven states won by President Donald Trump in November’s election would be among the 10 hardest hit by the proposal. Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity, both based in the Washington area, said the “border adjustment tax,” or BAT, would harm all 50 states, but that those heavily dependent on imports could suffer most. The report predicted economic harm to Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas - all states Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. The list of hard-hit states also includes California, New Jersey and Illinois, which were carried by Democrat Hillary Clinton. The study was sharply criticized by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who intends to include the BAT in tax reform legislation this spring. “That so-called study will be easily discredited and probably fits the definition of fake news,” Brady told reporters. “It takes one provision, pretends the economy freezes ... applies it in our current tax code and comes up with fantasy figures.” BAT, billed as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing, would exempt export revenues from federal tax, while ending the deductibility of import costs by corporations, making imports for production or resale costlier. The plan is part of a tax reform blueprint supported by House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. Trump is also working on a tax plan. Billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch have funded both groups behind the study. The Kochs exert strong financial and ideological influence on the Republican Party. Opposition to BAT from the Kochs and import-dependent industries suggests a rocky road ahead for Trump’s stated priority of tax reform. The proposal is also opposed by a number of Senate Republicans who could prevent its passage, should the House approve a tax reform bill that contains it.  Koch organizations, including the brothers’ privately held conglomerate Koch Industries, have warned that BAT could devastate the U.S. economy by raising prices on consumer goods, including gasoline. Refineries owned by Koch Industries rely on oil imports from Canada. The Koch groups say they support tax reform but oppose BAT.  ",1
"The plot thickens Republican donor and operative from Chicago s North Shore who said he had tried to obtain Hillary Clinton s missing emails from Russian hackers killed himself in a Minnesota hotel room days after talking to The Wall Street Journal about his efforts, public records show.In a room at a Rochester hotel used almost exclusively by Mayo Clinic patients and relatives, Peter W. Smith, 81, left a carefully prepared file of documents, which includes a statement police called a suicide note in which he said he was in ill health and a life insurance policy was expiring.Days earlier, the financier from suburban Lake Forest gave an interview to the Journal about his quest, and it published stories about his efforts beginning in late June. The Journal also reported it had seen emails written by Smith showing his team considered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, then a top adviser to Republican Donald Trump s campaign, as an ally. Flynn briefly was President Trump s national security adviser and resigned after it was determined he had failed to disclose contacts with Russia.At the time, the newspaper reported Smith s May 14 death came about 10 days after he granted the interview. Mystery shrouded how and where he had died, but the lead reporter on the stories said on a podcast he had no reason to believe the death was the result of foul play and that Smith likely had died of natural causes.The Journal stories said it was on Labor Day weekend in 2016 that Smith had assembled a team to acquire emails the team theorized might have been stolen from the private server Clinton had used while secretary of state. Smith s focus was the more than 30,000 emails Clinton said she deleted because they related to personal matters. A huge cache of other Clinton emails were made public.Smith told the Journal he believed the missing emails might have had been obtained by Russian hackers. He also said he thought the correspondence related to Clinton s official duties. He told the Journal he worked independently and was not part of the Trump campaign. He also told the Journal he and his team found five groups of hackers   two of them Russian groups   who claimed to have Clinton s missing emails.Smith had a history of doing opposition research, the formal term for unflattering information that political operatives dig up about rival candidates.For years, Democratic President Bill Clinton was Smith s target. The wealthy businessman had a hand in exposing the  Troopergate  allegations about Bill Clinton s sex life. And he discussed financing a probe of a 1969 trip Bill Clinton had taken while in college to the Soviet Union, according to Salon magazine.Smith s death occurred at the Aspen Suites in Rochester, records show. They list the cause of death as  asphyxiation due to displacement of oxygen in confined space with helium. Rochester Police Chief Roger Peterson on Wednesday called his manner of death  unusual,  but a funeral home worker said he d seen it before.An employee with Rochester Cremation Services, the funeral home that responded to the hotel, said he helped remove Smith s body from his room and recalled seeing a tank.However, the Chicago Tribune obtained a Minnesota state death record filed in Olmsted County that says Smith committed suicide in a hotel near the Mayo Clinic at 1:17 p.m. on Sunday, May 14. He was found with a bag over his head with a source of helium attached. A medical examiner s report gives the same account, without specifying the time, and a report from Rochester police further details his suicide.In the note recovered by police, Smith apologized to authorities and said that  NO FOUL PLAY WHATSOEVER  was involved in his death. He wrote that he was taking his own life because of a  RECENT BAD TURN IN HEALTH SINCE JANUARY, 2017  and timing related  TO LIFE INSURANCE OF $5 MILLION EXPIRING. One of Smith s former employees told the Tribune he thought the elderly man had gone to the famed clinic to be treated for a heart condition. Mayo spokeswoman Ginger Plumbo said Thursday she could not confirm Smith had been a patient, citing medical privacy laws.Peter Smith wrote two blog posts dated the day before he was found dead. One challenged U.S. intelligence agency findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. Another post predicted:  As attention turns to international affairs, as it will shortly, the Russian interference story will die of its own weight. Chicago Tribune h/t Gary Klug  @garyinlv01 Peter W. Smith tweeted an interesting article on January 16, 2017. The article says Russian hackers did not hack the DNC emails and that the person who hacked them is a Russian named Dmitri Alperovitch who also worked for Barack Obama.Russian ex-national guards U.S. nuclear codes for Obama https://t.co/j0vz8h1Cmx  Peter W. Smith (@PTRSIH) January 16, 2017State of The Nation 2012   Russians did not hack the DNC system, a Russian named Dmitri Alperovitch is the hacker and he works for President Obama. In the last five years the Obama administration has turned exclusively to one Russian to solve every major cyber-attack in America, whether the attack was on the U.S. government or a corporation. Only one  super-hero cyber-warrior  seems to  have the codes  to figure out  if  a system was hacked and by  whom. Dmitri s company, CrowdStrike has been called in by Obama to solve mysterious attacks on many high level government agencies and American corporations, including: German Bundestag, Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the White House, the State Department, SONY, and many others.CrowdStrike s philosophy is:  You don t have a malware problem; you have an adversary problem. CrowdStrike has played a critical role in the development of America s cyber-defense policy. Dmitri Alperovitch and George Kurtz, a former head of the FBI cyberwarfare unit founded CrowdStrike. Shawn Henry, former executive assistant director at the FBI is now CrowdStrike s president of services. The company is crawling with former U.S. intelligence agents.Before Alperovitch founded CrowdStrike in 2011, he was working in Atlanta as the chief threat officer at the antivirus software firm McAfee, owned by Intel (a DARPA company). During that time, he  discovered  the Chinese had compromised at least seventy-one companies and organizations, including thirteen defense contractors, three electronics firms, and the International Olympic Committee. He was the only person to notice the biggest cyberattack in history! Nothing suspicious about that.Alperovitch and the DNCAfter CrowdStrike was hired as an independent  vendor  by the DNC to investigate a possible cyberattack on their system, Alperovitch sent the DNC a proprietary software package called Falcon that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. According to Alperovitch, Falcon  lit up,  within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC. Alperovitch had his  proof  in TEN SECONDS that Russia was in the network. This  alleged  evidence of Russian hacking has yet to be shared with anyone.As Donald Trump has pointed out, the FBI, the agency that should have been immediately involved in hacking that effects  National Security,  has yet to even examine the DNC system to begin an investigation. Instead, the FBI and 16 other U.S.  intelligence  agencies simply  agree  with Obama s most trusted  cyberwarfare  expert Dmitri Alperovitch s  TEN SECOND  assessment that produced no evidence to support the claim.Also remember that it is only Alperovitch and CrowdStrike that claim to have evidence that it was Russian hackers. In fact, only two hackers were found to have been in the system and were both identified by Alperovitch as Russian FSB (CIA) and the Russian GRU (DoD). It is only Alperovitch who claims that he knows that it is Putin behind these two hackers.Alperovitch failed to mention in his conclusive  TEN SECOND  assessment that Guccifer 2.0 had already hacked the DNC and made available to the public the documents he hacked   before Alperovitch did his ten second assessment. Alperovitch reported that no other hackers were found, ignoring the fact that Guccifer 2.0 had already hacked and released DNC documents to the public. Alperovitch s assessment also goes directly against Julian Assange s repeated statements that the DNC leaks did not come from the Russians.The ridiculously fake cyber-attack assessment done by Alperovitch and CrowdStrike na vely flies in the face of the fact that a DNC insider admitted that he had released the DNC documents. Julian Assange implied in an interview that the murdered Democratic National Committee staffer, Seth Rich, was the source of a trove of damaging emails the website posted just days before the party s convention. Seth was on his way to testify about the DNC leaks to the FBI when he was shot dead in the street.It is also absurd to hear Alperovitch state that the Russian FSB (equivalent to the CIA) had been monitoring the DNC site for over a year and had done nothing. No attack, no theft, and no harm was done to the system by this  false-flag cyber-attack  on the DNC   or at least, Alperovitch  reported  there was an attack. The second hacker, the supposed Russian military (GRU   like the U.S. DoD) hacker, had just entered the system two weeks before and also had done  nothing  but observe.It is only Alperovitch s word that reports that the Russian FSB was  looking for files on Donald Trump.  It is only this false claim that spuriously ties Trump to the  alleged  attack. It is also only Alperovitch who believes that this hack that was supposedly  looking for Trump files  was an attempt to  influence  the election. No files were found about Trump by the second hacker, as we know from Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0 s leaks. To confabulate that  Russian s hacked the DNC to influence the elections  is the claim of one well-known Russian spy. Then, 17 U.S. intelligence agencies unanimously confirm that Alperovitch is correct   even though there is no evidence and no investigation was ever conducted.How does Dmitri Alperovitch have such power? Why did Obama again and again use Alperovitch s company, CrowdStrike, when they have miserably failed to stop further cyber-attacks on the systems they were hired to protect? Why should anyone believe CrowdStrikes false-flag report?After documents from the DNC continued to leak, and Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks made CrowdStrike s report look foolish, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than he had reported. He single-handedly concluded that the Russians were conducting an  influence operation  to help win the election for Trump. This false assertion had absolutely no evidence to back it up.On July 22, three days before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks dumped a massive cache of emails that had been  stolen  (not hacked) from the DNC. Reporters soon found emails suggesting that the DNC leadership had favored Hillary Clinton in her primary race against Bernie Sanders, which led Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC chair, along with three other officials, to resign.Just days later, it was discovered that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) had been hacked. CrowdStrike was called in again and once again, Alperovitch immediately  believed  that Russia was responsible. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author. Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0 s website. This time Guccifer released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, Guccifer went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.Once again, Guccifer 2.0 proved Alperovitch and CrowdStrike s claims to be grossly incorrect about the hack originating from Russia, with Putin masterminding it all. Nancy Pelosi offered members of Congress Alperovitch s suggestion of installing Falcon, the system that failed to stop cyberattacks at the DNC, on all congressional laptops.Key Point: Once Falcon was installed on the computers of members of the U.S. Congress, CrowdStrike had even further full access into U.S. government accounts.Obama   No Friend of AmericaObama is no friend of America in the war against cyber-attacks. The very agencies and departments being defended by Michael Alperovitch s  singular and most brilliant  ability to write encryption codes have all been successfully attacked and compromised since Michael set up the codes. But we shouldn t worry, because if there is a cyberattack in the Obama administration, Michael s son Dmitri is called in to  prove  that it isn t the fault of his father s codes. It was the  damn Russians , or even  Putin himself  who attacked American networks.Not one of the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies is capable of figuring out a successful cyberattack against America without Michael and Dmitri s help. Those same 17 U.S. intelligence agencies were not able to effectively launch a successful cyberattack against Russia. It seems like the Russian s have strong codes and America has weak codes. We can thank Michael and Dmitri Alperovitch for that.It is clear that there was no DNC hack beyond Guccifer 2.0. Dmitri Alperovitch is a  frontman  for his father s encryption espionage mission.Is it any wonder that Trump says that he has  his own people  to deliver his intelligence to him that is outside of the infiltrated U.S. government intelligence agencies and the Obama administration? Isn t any wonder that citizens have to go anywhere BUT the MSM to find real news or that the new administration has to go to independent news to get good intel?It is hard to say anything more damnable than to again quote Dmitri on these very issues:  If someone steals your keys to encrypt the data, it doesn t matter how secure the algorithms are.

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A passenger bus swerved off course and drove into a busy pedestrian underpass in Moscow on Monday, killing at least four people, Russian news agencies reported. Video from the scene posted on social media showed a bus veering off the road and plunging down the steps of a pedestrian underpass, crushing several people beneath its wheels. The driver of the bus had been detained by police, agencies said, after he lost control of the vehicle. The incident occurred on one of the Russian capital s busiest roads near the Slavyansky Boulevard metro station. Monday was an ordinary working day in Russia where Orthodox Christmas will be celebrated on Jan. 7.  An unnamed emergency services source told the TASS news agency that the number of fatalities had risen to five people. There were also unconfirmed reports that some 15 people had been injured. The Interfax news agency said investigators were looking into whether the incident had occurred as a result of a technical fault with the bus. Ten ambulances, fire service personnel, and three medivac helicopters were on the scene, agencies reported. ",1
"The victim of the angry Bernie Sanders supporter has an amazing attitude. It s the civility many of us have come to expect from Trump supporters who ve been unjustly attacked by uncivil and in many cases, unlawful Bernie Sanders supporters. A politically-motivated vandal in Washington State admittedly vandalized a Trump supporter s car, slashing its tires and dumping rotten yogurt through its sun roof, according to a police report filed last Monday.The suspect, named in the report as one Riley M. Silva of Gig Harbour, Washington, confessed his crime to the police. Showing no sign of remorse, he claimed his victim was an  ignorant bigot  and that he  improved the community  by vandalizing the car. According to the report, the culprit became angry after noticing that the car sported a Donald Trump sticker.His full confession to the police, which was originally posted on the blog of lawyer and author Mike Cernovich, reads as follows:I on the 11th day of the 4th month of 2016 did maliciously attack a hate symbol protected by the first amendment. After disabling the vehicle and dumping rotten food into the interior I feel I have improved the community and supported our nation s values by stopping a promoter of hate speech. I do not wish to have ignorant bigots in my town and in a just world the person deserved what was received and the situation is made whole.As America is far from just, I expect the bigot will want to be made whole. With this I declare he is owed nothng. But as the situation is what it is, I intend to make the individual whole provided he cease to promote ignorance and hate. I do not expect the law to recognize damage to tools of hate or fascism. Such things need to be destroyed so good people may remain and become free.The victim, Nathan Elliot, later posted pictures of the damage to his vehicle. In his statement to the police, he said that the damage to the tire alone would cost $500 to repair.Bernie Sanders supporter didn't like my Trump bumper sticker, so he vandalized my personal property.

The victim saw him while he was in the process of vandalizing his car, at which point he yelled at and ran towards the culprit, who fled in his own vehicle. In the report, Elliot claims that the culprit almost hit two other cars as he drove away from the scene. In addition to vandalizing the victim s car, Silva has been charged with reckless driving. -Breitbart NewsEven though I have amazing @USAA insurance, all costs will come out of my own pocket.

"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Militia fighters in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo attacked a U.N. peacekeeping base on Friday, triggering clashes that left two of the fighters dead and two peacekeepers slightly wounded, the U.N. mission said. Thirty-four rebels from a Mai-Mai militia have been killed in fighting with Congo s army in the past week, local army spokesman Jules Ngongo said, a spike in violence he attributed to an army crackdown on the militia s harassment of local residents. Friday s attack, in which two rebels were also wounded, was a rare frontal assault on U.N. forces charged with protecting civilians in Congo s east, where dozens of armed groups exploit mineral resources and prey on local residents.  Very early this morning, about 30 Mai-Mai attacked,  mission spokeswoman Florence Marchal told Reuters, adding that U.N. forces drove off the assailants. It was not immediately clear which Mai-Mai group attacked nor what their objective was. The Mai-Mai comprise a number of armed bands that originally formed to resist Rwandan invasions in the 1990s. They have since morphed into a wide variety of ethnic-based militia, smuggling networks and protection rackets. Congo s mineral-rich eastern borderlands are a tinderbox of ethnic tensions and for more than two decades have been racked by violence that has often spilled across the country s borders. President Joseph Kabila s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December has fueled further unrest in the country s east, where wars between 1996-2003 killed millions, and center, where an insurgency against the central government has killed thousands since last August. Last week, U.N. forces in east Congo s South Kivu province intervened with helicopters and heavy machine guns to help beat back an advance by a separate rebel group on the strategic city of Uvira. The U.N. mission in Congo, known as MONUSCO, is the world s largest with some 18,000 uniformed personnel and a more than $1 billion annual budget.  ",1

"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has quit negotiations on a voluntary pact to deal with migration because the global approach to the issue was  simply not compatible with U.S. sovereignty,  said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.  In a statement released late on Saturday, the U.S. mission to the U.N. noted that President Donald Trump made the decision.   No country has done more than the United States, and our generosity will continue,  said Haley, whose parents are immigrants from India.  But our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone.    We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country,  she said. Trump campaigned last year on a promise to deport large numbers of immigrants and build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to help tackle illegal immigration and crime in the United States. Since he took office in January, he has also moved to ban U.S. entry by people from select Muslim countries.  With a record 21.3 million refugees globally, the 193-member U.N. General Assembly adopted a political declaration in September last year in which they also agreed to spend two years negotiating the pact on safe, orderly and regular migration. Former U.S. President Barack Obama s administration backed the resolution, known as the New York Declaration, which also asked U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi to propose a global compact on refugees for adoption in 2018.   The global approach in the New York Declaration is simply not compatible with U.S. sovereignty,  Haley said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres regretted the U.S. decision, his spokesman said on Sunday, but expressed hope the United States might re-engage in the talks.  The positive story of migration is clear: it needs to be better told. Equally, the challenges it throws up need to be tackled with more determination and greater international coordination,  U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said. Three days of preparatory talks begin in Mexico on Monday ahead of the start of formal negotiations in February over the non-binding pact.  Haley s predecessor Samantha Power mocked the U.S. move.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder on Thursday extended a state of emergency in Flint until April 14, as the Michigan legislature gave final approval of $28 million to address the drinking water crisis. Snyder’s move approved by the state legislature means the state emergency declaration will continue as long as the federal emergency declaration issued earlier this month by President Barack Obama. The state declaration was originally set to end Feb. 1. “Extending this emergency will help us continue these efforts while working on long-term solutions to help Flint recover,” Snyder said of providing access to bottled water, filters and testing kits. Separately, Michigan Democrats in Congress said Thursday they want to win backing for up to $600 million in U.S. support of Flint. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters and Rep. Dan Kildee of Flint said they will offer an amendment to a pending Senate Energy bill that would provide up to $400 million to replace or fix lead pipes. The proposal would require the state of Michigan to match any federal funding. The proposal would also direct $200 million in federal funds for a research center to focus on the needs of children and would also require the Environmental Protection Agency to warn the public of high lead levels in drinking water if a state fails to do so. Peters said Democrats also want a change in the law to allow the federal government to forgive $20 million in loans to Flint. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Obama administration does not have a position yet on the proposal, and was not aware of any plans to place Flint under some kind of special category. Soul singer and Detroit native Aretha Franklin told MSNBC on Thursday she was donating 50 hotel rooms nightly and money for food during the crisis, and has urged other Motown artists to help. U.S. Representative Xavier Becerra, speaking in Baltimore at a Democratic retreat, said someone should be arrested. “What went down in Flint should cause someone to have a rap sheet,” he said. “There should be some indictments.” The Detroit Free Press reported on Thursday, citing state government emails released by liberal group Progress Michigan, that in January 2015 while state officials were telling Flint residents their water was safe to drink they were arranging for coolers of purified water in Flint’s state office building. The $28 million approved by the state will be used to provide bottled water and other supplies, put nurses in local schools and more. ",1
"The Women s March on Washington crowd blew Trump s inauguration audience out of the water on Saturday, but actress Ashley Judd delivered the kick to the balls Trump deserves.After months of being insulted on the campaign trail, hundreds of thousands of women rose up and traveled to our nation s capital to protest their attacker becoming the new president.Trump repeatedly attacked women by insulting their looks and even got caught admitting that he gropes women without their consent. Multiple women have come forward with their own stories of Trump sexually assaulting them and being a creep in general.After the Republican National Convention in July, Judd shared her own experiences of being ogled by Trump. I ve known Donald for 15, 17 years?  Judd told Jezebel. I m friends with someone who married into the family. Anyway, I would bump into him at the U.S. Open, for example, and I think I can say the amount of time he has spent looking at my chest rather than my face is proportional to his insanity and functionality. If I may, this is what it s like to talk to Donald Trump,  she continued.  He s a chest gazer, a breast gazer, let s be more specific and, referring to the person who at that time was married into the family, he just sexualized her.  Doesn t she look great? Doesn t she look ?  He s just revolting. And Judd continued blasting Trump by reading a poem written by 19-year-old Nina Donovan in response to Trump remarks about grabbing women  by the p*ssy. I am a nasty woman. Not as nasty as a man who looks like he bathes in Cheeto dust, a man whose words are a dis to America, Electoral College-sanctioned hate speech contaminating this national anthem. I m not as nasty as Confederate flags being tattooed across my city. The poem continued by slamming racism and the new slavery of the prison system before nailing Trump for pandering to neo-Nazis. I feel Hitler in these streets, Nazis renamed I am not as nasty as racism, fraud, conflict of interest, homophobia, sexual assault, transphobia, white supremacy, misogyny, ignorance, white privilege. The poem then referenced Trump s creepy obsession with his daughter Ivanka. I m not as nasty as your daughter being your favorite sex symbol, like your wet dreams infused with your own genes. Judd then concluded the poem. Our p*ssies ain t for grabbing. This p*ssy is for my pleasure and giving birth to more nasty women.

"Silly, silly Donna Brazile. She s publishing a book detailing turmoil in the Democratic Party during the 2016 campaign, highlighted by her concern that Hillary Clinton was seriously ill and might need to be replaced by Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders.Was the Democrat Party setting up Joe Biden to replace Hillary when she accompanied him to his hometown in Scranton, PA? The media completely ignored Hillary s inability to walk or stand unassisted in front of, and inside Joe s childhood home, that was all caught on this incredible, but mostly hidden video. In the video below, Hillary can be seen using the arm of the homeowner for support while reaching for the railing next to the stairs to stabilize herself. She can be seen repeatedly grasping for the railing outside, and then later on, when Hillary s inside the home, she seems unable to stand on her own, as she grasps for the backs of chairs and the kitchen table.Watch:Earlier in the day, Vice President Joe Biden was forced to help the seriously ill Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton down from the podium where she spoke at a small rally.What s the big deal? There s no news here because all this was well-known and covered at the time by the big national newspapers and networks, right?Wrong. If Brazile were rehashing things we knew, there would be no book and no bombshell headlines now.Instead, she has thrown open a new and very big window on 2016   and exposed yet again the consequences of the political biases of the Democratic media.The missed stories are not merely the result of mistakes or sloppy reporting. Brazile s book is a revelation in that it shows that many left-leaning journalists didn t so much cover Clinton as cover up for her.Put it this way: How is it possible that the leader of the Democratic Party was talking to colleagues about trying to replace its nominee during the general election because of health concerns, and none of the thousands of journalists covering the campaign got wind of it?It s not possible   if the media had been playing it down the middle and holding both candidates to the same standard of scrutiny. But big media missed a big story because so much campaign  news  coverage was tilted toward defeating Donald Trump and electing Clinton.Anything that could possibly suggest Trump was unfit for the Oval Office   bingo, front page, top of the broadcast.On the other hand, anything that could hurt Clinton was downplayed or ignored. Nothing to see here, move along.The coverage of Clinton s health was a prime example of the tilt. Her coughing fits, especially a long one on Labor Day, and a history of falling were pointed out by the popular Drudge Report, some Republicans and smaller, conservative-leaning sites to suggest she was not being honest about her health.But her campaign always denied anything was wrong   allergies, the candidate, and her flacks insisted, caused the persistent coughs, and major news organizations mostly nodded their heads and stayed mum, accepting the official denials without skepticism.The dam cracked a bit on Labor Day, when an NBC reporter filed a 91-word, four-paragraph story that said Clinton had been unable to finish her speech in Ohio because of a coughing fit.The truth was dangerous, so the Praetorian Guard sprang to Clinton s defense. The NBC reporter, Andrew Rafferty, was mocked and insulted, first by the campaign, and then by journalists, including some MSNBC commentators who turned on their colleague as if he had violated a secret oath.CNN joined the Clinton amen chorus, and at the Washington Post, political writer Chris Cillizza denounced the topic of Clinton s health as  a totally ridiculous issue  and declared it a  sure-fire loser  for Trump. It s hard to plausibly insist, based on the available data, that Clinton is ill,  insisted Cillizza, who is now at CNN.Five days later, Clinton was unable to walk on her own and collapsed at the 9/11 ceremony in Manhattan as she tried to get into a van. The campaign insisted she was just  dehydrated  until a short video of the incident aired, then admitted the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia days earlier.In other words, the claim of allergies was a big fat lie. That prompted Brazile to contemplate starting the process of replacing Clinton, writing in her book that the campaign also was  anemic  and had  the odor of failure.  She says she considered numerous tickets to replace Clinton and Sen. Tim Kane, and decided that Biden and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) would be the best.It s not clear how long she deliberated or how many people she talked to, but Brazile writes that Biden called her on Sept. 12. In the end, she says, she made no move because she couldn t disappoint Clinton s supporters.For entire story: NYP",0

"You know how everyone suspected that there would be some quid pro quo for all the help Vladimir Putin gave Donald Trump during the election? Well, it s happening.On Thursday, Donald Trump lifted sanctions imposed by President Obama that prevented Putin from cyberspying. The sanctions were a response to Putin s team of hackers doing Trump a series of favors by hacking his political opponents and releasing any and all information they could that could assist him in becoming President. Reuters reports:The Treasury Department said in a statement it would allow U.S. companies to make limited transactions with the intelligence service that are needed to gain approval to import information technology products into Russia.The broader significance of the sanctions exemptions were not immediately clear. The Treasury Department often issues general licenses such as the one announced on Thursday to help U.S. companies overcome unintended business consequences of sanctions.U.S. intelligence agencies accused the FSB of involvement in hacking of Democratic organizations during the election, won by Republican Donald Trump.The agencies and private cyber security experts concluded the FSB first broke into the Democratic National Committee s computer system in the summer of 2015 and began monitoring email and chat conversations.They say FSB was one of two Russian spy agencies believed to have been involved in a wide-ranging operation by top-ranking individuals in Russia s government to discredit Democrat Hillary Clinton and help Trump win the election.When Obama imposed the sanctions, Vladimir Putin announced that he would wait to respond until after Trump became President because he expected a response that favors him. This move was just the first of many we can expect to benefit Vladimir Putin. This is the same group (FSB) that, just a month ago, our intelligence community determined was responsible for the attack on our democracy,  Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., ranking member of a House CIA subcommittee, said in response to Trump  rewarding  Putin for his help during the election.  We just made it easier for the same group to import into Russia the tools they could use to hack us or our allies again. Naturally, Americans are not happy with this new development:Riddle me this Batman, how is lifting sanctions against Russia not a change in policy?

"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia s government said on Wednesday it had requested a U.S. air strike that killed scores of suspected militants to help pave the way for an upcoming ground offensive against Islamist group al Shabaab. The U.S. military s Africa Command (Africom) said on Tuesday it had killed more than 100 of the al Qaeda-linked insurgents in the strike on a camp 125 miles (200 km) northwest of the capital Mogadishu.  Those militants were preparing explosives and attacks. Operations against al Shabaab have been stepped up,          Somali Information Minister Abdirahman Omar Osman told Reuters.  We have asked the U.S. to help us from the air to make our readied ground offensive more successful.  Al Shabaab spokesman Abdiasis Abu Musab denied the air strike had taken place.  It is just... propaganda,  he told Reuters.  The United States has ramped up operations in Somalia this year after President Donald Trump loosened the rules of engagement in March. Africom reported eight U.S. air strikes from May to August, compared to 13 for the whole of 2016. Including Tuesday s strike, it has reported five this month alone. The Pentagon said the U.S. military would continue to target militants in strikes in coordination with the Somali government. Al Shabaab has lost control of most of Somalia s cities and towns since African Union peacekeepers supporting Somali troops pushed the insurgency out of the capital Mogadishu in 2011. But it retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center. Somali president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a dual U.S.-Somali citizen, has taken a harder line than his predecessors against the insurgency since he was sworn in earlier this year. But his plans have been undermined by the poor state of the Somali military and political infighting.  He has also had to try to mend fences with the powerful Habar Gidir clan, following a raid involving U.S. forces on the town of Bariire in August in which 10 people were killed including three children.

"Jamie Ross Courthouse News ServicePHOENIX   Two towns on the Arizona-Utah border dominated by members of a fundamentalist Mormon sect discriminated against residents who are not members of the church, a jury found Monday afternoon, granting $2.2 million in damages to six residents.The U.S. government sued Colorado City, Ariz., and Hildale, Utah in 2012, accusing the border towns of denying police protection, water and housing to nonmembers of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The church s leader, Warren Jeffs, is imprisoned in Texas for life plus 20 years for the sexual abuse of two young girls he had taken as his  spiritual wives.  INSULATED: Hilldale s religious enclave has triggered America s curiosity.The jury returned the verdict after nearly seven weeks of testimony, finding that the towns engaged in religious discrimination of nonmembers of the church in violation of the First Amendment s establishment clause. Another aspect of the verdict found that the towns  police force   the Colorado City Marshal s Office   violated the Fourth and 14th Amendments by subjecting nonmembers to unreasonable search and seizures and arrest without probable cause.The jury also found that Colorado City, Hildale and the cities  water utility, the Twin City Water Authority, violated the Fair Housing Act. Obviously, we should ve went a different way, but we respect the process,  said Blake Hamilton, an attorney for Hildale, after the verdict was announced. The case is far from over,  said Colorado City attorney Jeff Matura.  [The Justice Department] will have to propose what kind of injunctive relief they want. After deliberating for three days, the jury awarded six residents $2.2 million in damages for discrimination. The amount is not binding.During trial, the towns and the Justice Department entered into a $1.6 million settlement to cover damages suffered by the individuals, and possible civil penalties and fines.Christopher Jessop testified that church security ran his son off the road, and that the Marshal s Office helped cover it up.Nicknamed the  God Squad,  church security is said to monitor current and former FLDS members and keep an eye out for outside law enforcement.Jessop also testified that the Marshal s Office failed to investigate dozens of incidents of vandalism against his vehicle. The jury awarded him $1 million.Another $1 million will go to John Cook, a man repeatedly denied a water connection on a property to park his trailer.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats vowed on Tuesday to fight a measure expected to be slipped into budget legislation that would open Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Reserve to oil and gas drilling, saying it would destroy one of earth’s remaining paradises. Northern Alaska’s ANWR is a wilderness about the size of South Carolina that supports tribes that have fished and hunted there for thousands of years and is home to polar bears, caribou and birds vulnerable to development.  A plan passed by the Senate budget committee late last month contains a directive for the Senate energy committee to draw up a provision securing $1 billion in revenue for the budget, which is expected to be voted on late Thursday.  The head of the energy panel, Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and a longtime proponent of drilling in ANWR, is expected to write a provision opening the reserve. She and Senator Dan Sullivan, also an Alaska Republican, have both supported measures to open up parts of ANWR. “This Republican budget scam to hand over the wildest place left in America to Big Oil should be removed from the budget and put on ice,” said Senator Edward Markey.  Senator Jeff Merkley said there is “something cynical and sad” about the effort because it could boost oil output from the U.S. state that is already feeling the fastest effects of climate change, which the overwhelming majority of scientists link to human-caused carbon emissions. An environmentalist said Republicans were trying to sneak drilling into the budget and eliminate opportunities for debate.  Lydia Weiss, the director of government relations at the Wilderness Society, called it an “unacceptable abuse of Senate procedure” and said Americans deserve to see the Senate debate the issue in the open. Petroleum interests have long lobbied to explore in the area and say technology advances mean the impact of operations on the reserve would be smaller than in years past.  Still, it is uncertain whether energy companies that have faced static crude prices amid a wealth of oil and gas in the continental United States would be willing to increase drilling in the harsh and frigid Arctic.   Markey said the group is reaching out to Republicans for support in opposition to the drilling amendment, which likely will need 50 votes in the 100-member chamber to pass. Democrats hope Republican senators John McCain and Susan Collins, who have previously voted against drilling, will support them.  ",1
"SUBTITLED VIDEO:HERE S ANOTHER JOURNALIST S TAKE ON WHAT S HAPPENED TO SWEDEN: SWEDEN: FROM ABBA TO ALLAH In the 1970s Sweden was a stable and wealthy country that was admired by many outsiders. It had international pop artists such as ABBA, sports stars like Bj rn Borg and Ingemar Stenmark as well as Volvo cars. Some outsiders still maintain this rosy image. In 2016, Sweden was still ranked as the world s   goodest   country.Unfortunately, being  good  in the Western world today seems to mean being suicidal.In just two generations, Sweden has become an increasingly dysfunctional and crime-ridden country. The main cause of this negative transformation is non-European mass immigration.I have been chronicling Sweden s decline for many years. My reports were falsely dismissed as fantasies made by an alleged  right-wing extremist.  This denial is no longer possible.Many alternative media and independent websites are now describing these issues. Major media in Britain, Germany, the USA and even in Russia have also finally discovered Sweden s Multicultural problems. This is causing huge embarrassment to the ruling elites in Sweden. They are used to being admired. They are not accustomed to international ridicule, or being viewed as an example of what not to do.Events reached a peak when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly made negative remarks about the problems in Sweden. The Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan L fven has repeatedly rejected suggestions that the authorities have lost control. On February 20, 2017, the former Prime Minister Carl Bildt accused President Trump of   engaging in misinformation and slander  against Sweden. That very same night, violent riots once again erupted in one of the no-go zones near Stockholm that allegedly do not exist.Car burning in Sweden, January 2017 All former Swedish governments since the 1970s, including those led by Mr. Bildt and Mr. L fven, have directly contributed to the massive problems Sweden is currently facing.Carl Bildt served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1991 to 1994. He was in charge of a center-right coalition government by Swedish standards. Bildt served as Minister for Foreign Affairs between 2006 and 2014 in the center-right coalition of PM Fredrik Reinfeldt. These governments also continued mass immigration, just as the Socialist Prime Ministers Olof Palme, Ingvar Carlsson, G ran Persson and Stefan L fven did.The Swedish author Astrid Lindgren published the first stories about Pippi Longstocking in the 1940s. If they were updated for today, perhaps Pippi would have to flee from the suburbs of a Swedish city after having been gang raped by immigrant boys. Alternatively, she might have been a radical Feminist who donned the Islamic veil in order to express her solidarity with the Muslims who are colonizing her country.The Swedish mass media and political elites are very careful not to suggest any connection between rapes and mass immigration from Third World countries. Yet there is every reason to suspect that such a connection exists. We know from other Western European countries that immigrants from certain regions and cultures, particularly from the Islamic world and Africa, are disproportionately represented as perpetrators in rape cases.READ MORE: GATE OF VIENNA",0
"Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz dropped a big bomb during an interview on CNN today. She claimed that Jeh Johnson s  testimony about the DNC computer hack is  wrong in every respect  and  utterly misinformed.  Whoa! Who s telling the truth?Schultz told the CNN anchor  He s wrong in every respect. Let me be very clear. At no point during my tenure at the DNC was I contacted by the FBI, DHS, or any government agency, or alerted or made aware that they believed that the Russians, an enemy state, was intruding on our network. In case you missed it, former DHS Director Jeh Johnson testified to lawmakers this week that the DNC rejected his agency s offer to protect its network despite receiving warnings about a computer hack. Instead, the DNC chose an outside cyber security firm to help solve the computer hacks that led to WikiLeaks publishing thousands of its emails.CNN s Bolduan asked Schultz how both accounts could be true:  Secretary Johnson says DNC rebuffed the help offered. You are saying no one contacted you? Schultz replied with a shocking statement:  Secretary Johnson is utterly misinformed. That is simply not accurate. Schultz went further and blamed the FBI for not helping: They left the Russians on our network for more than for almost a year before we discovered that they were there. ",0
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has confidence in its economic relations with the United States going forward and will continue to open up and provide broader market access, Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang said on Friday.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to make a stop in China in November during his first official visit to Asia, a U.S. official said on Tuesday, a trip that will come amid tensions over North Korea’s nuclear tests. Washington and its allies have said there is a growing urgency for China, North Korea’s top ally and trading partner, to apply more pressure on its already isolated neighbor to get it to back down on its nuclear weapons and missiles programs. Chinese President Xi Jinping had invited Trump to visit China during their meeting in April in Palm Beach, Florida. The two leaders also met on the sidelines on the G20 summit in July. Trump is set to attend the U.S.-ASEAN summit and the East Asia summit in the Philippines in November, as well as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Trump’s potential visit. Japanese public broadcaster NHK cited unnamed diplomatic sources saying that Trump was also considering visiting Japan and South Korea during his Asian tour in November. In February, Trump accepted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s invitation to visit Japan by the end of the year. “The February agreement is still valid. We would definitely like to make it happen sometime within this year. But no specific timing has been fixed yet,” a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said. Also, the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun said on Wednesday Japan, the United States and South Korea are in final stages of talks to hold a trilateral summit on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The newspaper, citing unnamed government sources, reported the meeting between Trump, Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in could take place on Sept. 21 and would focus on bolstering cooperation in response to North Korean provocation. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously voted to step up sanctions on North Korea, with its profitable textile exports now banned and fuel supplies capped. After several days of negotiations on the resolution, Washington dropped several measures to win the support of Russia and China, including a bid for an oil embargo and the blacklisting of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the national airline. In Hong Kong, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told the South China Morning Post the results of a U.S.-led investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property theft would be announced before the Beijing summit to reset bilateral trade. The far-right architect of Trump’s 2016 election victory, Bannon told an investor conference, organized by a unit of China’s largest brokerage, that Trump and Xi had a rapport that should enable them to work out differences, said an attendee at the meeting which was closed to the press. Bannon, who was let go by Trump last month, told a private lunch gathering in Hong Kong that he still “speaks with President Donald Trump every two to three days,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has been lambasted by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, but Chief Executive Jamie Dimon opted not to fire back on Wednesday while reviewing quarterly results and taking questions about his latest failure with regulators. “No comment,” Dimon quickly responded on a conference call with reporters when asked about Sanders’ recent statement that JPMorgan was among companies destroying the moral fabric of the nation. Nor was Dimon willing to respond to a follow-up question about the tone of the U.S. presidential campaign. To drive home the refusal, his top communications adviser, Joseph Evangelisti, stepped in and said, “We’re not going to comment on political statements.” Dimon also turned away from the chance to make his case again that JPMorgan’s size is an advantage. In the past he has argued that JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is good for customers, shareholders and the country because of the stability and efficiency that come with its scale and diverse mix of business. JPMorgan’s earnings came on the same day that federal regulators gave the bank and four other big banks a failing grade for their plans to show that they can be quickly and safely dismantled in bankruptcy. Dimon said JPMorgan will correct its plan. ",1

The President then referred to what he has seen so far in his short time serving in Washington, D.C.:Trump remarked that those graduating have given half a million hours of charity in just the past year. We don t need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives,  he followed.He said he was standing in front of leaders, one or two future U.S. presidents could be in the crowd. America has always been a land of dreams because America is a nation of true believers,  said Trump who then referred to the pilgrims landing at Plymouth. He remarked that the pilgrims prayed and, later, America s Founding Fathers invoked Creator God four times in the Declaration of Independence. Because in America we don t worship government, we worship God,  he said.Watch:He recognized that United States currency bears the phrase,  In God We Trust  and referenced  One nation under God  in the Pledge of Allegiance. The story of America is the story of an adventure that began with deep faith, big dreams, and humble beginnings,  said Trump who said Liberty University began in the same way.For entire story: Breitbart News",0
"Ever since Donald Trump won the election, Republicans have felt they have free reign to show just how racist and despicable they can be. The party s true colors are on full display, and today s GOPers have no shame in expressing their most vile thoughts and offensive sense of humor.We saw this today when Mike Huckabee decided to celebrate Cinco de Mayo by tweeting an extremely racist message, which he obviously thought was hilarious. The problem is, no one else did.People have criticized Huckabee s jokes before, stating that they re either not funny or mean-spirited, and some are just plain confusing. In this case, Huckabee went full racist and unleashed his funny bone on Twitter.Huckabee stated that in celebration of Cinco de Mayo, he would  drink an entire jar of hot salsa , watch racist cartoons and  speak Spanish  all day. You can t get more racist than that: If you didn t think this  joke  was funny, you re not alone   tons of people on Twitter didn t enjoy it, either   and they didn t hesitate to tell him. Huckabee got dragged on Twitter, proving that America won t stand for the  values  that the Trump administration is trying to push on the country. Here are some of the best responses:      Here s our favorite, and it s probably the response that will hurt the most, because it s true!After his presidential campaign crashed and burned, coming to a pathetic end, Huckabee is struggling to stay relevant. He hopped on the Trump train for a while, and this joke explains exactly why he supported the undeserving POTUS   racists love to stick together.Hopefully, the backlash to this tweet will remind Huckabee that no one likes him and that racism is still not okay, even if we do have a racist president at the moment.Featured image via Getty Images",0
"While Donald Trump may be winning among those taking part in the Republican primaries, his method for garnering votes will probably not hold up as well in the general election if he were to be the GOP nominee. So far, he s been incredibly racist and xenophobic, not to mention sexist, juvenile and just outright rude. All things that play well with a large part of the Republican base, and Trump clearly knows this.Knowing he s getting closer and closer to securing the Republican nomination, and knowing Hillary Clinton is very close to securing the Democratic nomination, Trump has made a clear pivot to the general election in his campaign strategy. Now, instead of making fun of his GOP competitors like Cruz and Kasich, he s putting more energy into making fun of Hillary Clinton. And I say  making fun,   that is literally in the most sophomoric sense it can be taken.While in Connecticut, Trump decided he would imitate the former Secretary of State and how she conducts herself with speeches. You know, like an adult   like a person who wants to be president.After talking about how many have asked him to be  more presidential,  he tells his crowd he simply can t do such a thing, because he needs to rile up and entertain his crowds so they don t fall asleep. Then he brings out his new attack line and nickname for Clinton and asks the crowd,  have you ever seen Crooked Hillary?  then imitates her walking on stage. Then he says,  Hello. How are you? This is Crooked Hillary Clinton?  and of course his crowd ate it up, because let s be real, they d be entertained by a paper bag floating in the wind ( oooh, so pretty! ).The imitation wasn t only horrible, it was in horrible taste. Trump is a man vying for the highest office in the entire nation and whoever wins the election will be leader of the free world, and he clearly thinks being a vile, misogynistic child is the way to behave to gain people s respect.Trump doesn t deserve our respect, he deserves our condemnation, and any decent person with half a brain should agree. So, let him perform for his crowd of imbecilic simpletons. The adults who will be deciding the general election will make damn sure he never sets foot in the Oval Office.Watch his insane performance here:.@realDonaldTrump says acting ""presidential"" is easy, does a Hillary Clinton impression: https://t.co/0SZwzCgxxz https://t.co/pRiNYg0Vbl  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 23, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",0
"Let s hope this angry leftist mayor doesn t prevent individual donors from contributing to help the people of San Juan who may not agree with her hateful attacks on our President, who is bending over backward to get the help to the victims of the hurricane.Is anyone else sick and tired of hearing this mayor whine about everything America is NOT doing for her? San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has refused to participate in any FEMA meetings regarding aid to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, has continually accused the Trump administration of not helping out in Puerto Rico s time of need, going so far as to claim the federal government is  killing  Puerto Ricans.Fox News  Geraldo Rivera went down to Puerto Rico and actually confronted Cruz about her statement that people are  dying  because of the Trump administration s  inefficiency and bureaucracy. But are people dying? I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying,  Rivera challenging Cruz said.  I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Dying is a continuum,  Cruz said in response.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people like we took out of a nursing home, severely dehydrated, you are dying. Of course dying is a continuum. Everyone eventually dies. It s an unfortunate part of life. But, when it comes to Puerto Ricans dying from neglect and a lack of supplies, Rivera wasn t buying it. The death count was 16 a week ago. It remains 16 today,  Rivera said.  People are not dying. Here s the video of Rivera s interview with Cruz:Backing up Rivera s claims, an article released on Sunday by the Daily Mail said that a Puerto Rican woman claiming to be a police officer alleged that Cruz and Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello have been holding back supplies  in order to make for better photo opportunities. The woman even went so far as to say that U.S. armed forces need to  come in and distribute the aid. Via: MRCTV",0
"Donald Trump s Inaugural Address received poor reviews for it s divisive and negative tone, not to mention the countless lies and promises he won t keep. But apparently, Fox News liked it that way.Trump portrayed America as a dystopian wasteland where inner cities are run by criminals, the military is crippled, and poverty is a plague across the land even though crime is down, the economy is strong with unemployment below five percent, and the military is the most funded in the world.Trump also suggested that President Obama was a tyrant who kept control of the government away from the people even though President Obama was duly elected by the people in 2008 and 2012 with a bigger popular vote and electoral vote margins than Trump received in 2016.Fox News, however, loved Trump s speech and Trump appreciated them kissing his ass so he tweeted about it on Saturday morning.A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!

"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Most of the world follows U.S. presidential elections closely, but Israel can seem particularly obsessive, endlessly assessing which candidate will better protect its interests and breaking down their every comment for policy clues. As America votes on Tuesday, a cartoon in the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz captured a sense of that fretfulness, depicting friends sitting outside a typical falafel stand and discussing in nerdy detail how the ballot will turn out.  “There’s no way he’d lose Utah and Arizona, and you can’t count on North Carolina,” one says to the other. “They’d need to win Pennsylvania and hopefully Florida,” the other replies. The fact is, despite all the nervous introspection, both Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump are likely to be reliable for Israel, continuing the broad policy mix U.S. presidents have pursued since the 1980s.  It’s the Palestinians who may have more to worry about. Over the past four years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had a fractious relationship with Barack Obama, openly campaigning against the U.S. deal on Iran’s nuclear program, including condemning it in a speech to Congress. But ultimately that did not stand in the way of the Obama administration’s agreeing a new, $38 billion, 10-year military aid package for Israel. And while the U.S. president has criticized Israel for building more settlements on land the Palestinians seek for their own state, the censure has never gone beyond words, essentially leaving Israel free to build. Analysts say that standoff-ish approach is likely to continue whether Clinton or Trump becomes president, and there are other reasons for Israel to expect a warmer embrace from the next administration than it has had from Obama. Netanyahu has been careful not to show favoritism, meeting both candidates and saying much the same thing afterwards. Clinton, a former New York senator and U.S. secretary of state, has repeatedly emphasized that she will protect Israel’s interests. Trump has said he will move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a popular line that would all but enshrine Jerusalem as the country’s capital. “We enjoy and appreciate the strong bipartisan support we get,” said Lior Weintraub, vice-president of The Israel Project, a pro-Israel lobby group, and a former chief of staff at the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. “We believe either president will continue the tradition of the many presidents from both sides of the aisle of fostering the alliance on every front, from security to culture.” While polls show most Israelis favor Clinton, Trump has a hard-core following among some national-religious Israelis, many of whom are originally from the United States. When it comes to policy, Israeli analysts see Clinton as having a better handle on the issues, and the people who are likely to handle the Middle East if she is elected are more familiar faces than those in Trump’s circle.  The question is what it may mean for the Palestinians. With deep internal divisions and little prospect of a resumption of peace talks with Israel, Palestinian observers believe neither candidate has their best interests at heart. “Either of them will maintain the U.S. commitment to aid Israel, the two have publicly angered the Palestinians in electoral speeches,” said analyst Hani Habib. “The only difference was that Trump promised to move the U.S. ambassador to Jerusalem while Clinton kept silent. “Any betting on either of them is a losing bet,” he said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said so-called “chain migration,” a term often used to refer to citizens or permanent residents sponsoring relatives or the clustering of certain immigrants in the same areas, cannot be included in any immigration legislation. “CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!” Trump wrote on Twitter. The  statement comes after Trump stunned many fellow Republicans this week by negotiating with top congressional Democratic leaders over the DACA program protecting the children of undocumented immigrants.

"ISE-SHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama disparaged U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday, saying the billionaire seeks tweets over solutions and has “rattled”  foreign leaders with his pronouncements. Obama accused the real estate mogul and former reality TV impresario of making cavalier comments for provocative effect, and he urged all presidential candidates to take the high road in a boisterous and harsh campaign. Weighing in on the race to succeed him with his strongest broadside yet against Trump, Obama said fellow leaders from the Group of Seven nations “are surprised by the Republican nominee”. “They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements but they are rattled by them,” the president told a news conference on the sidelines of a G7 summit in central Japan. “For good reason, because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines, instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe, secure and prosperous and the world on an even keel.”  Many U.S. allies fear Trump will feed insecurity in countries worried about China’s growing power, embolden nationalists and authoritarians, and unravel Obama’s “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific.      Trump has also been accused of racism and bigotry for saying he would build a wall to keep out illegal Mexican immigrants and would temporarily ban Muslims from the United States. He has also made comments considered demeaning to women. The race between Trump on the one hand and the Democratic candidates, front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Senator Bernie Sanders, for the Nov. 8 election has become increasingly bitter and personal. Trump this week took his use of accusations against Clinton to levels unprecedented in modern U.S. presidential campaigns, making incendiary statements that television networks cannot resist covering, giving him hours of free media and putting his opponents on the defensive. Obama said it was natural for journalists in such a campaign to elevate “every roll, blink, speed bump, conflict, trash talkin’”, but urged, instead, that candidates from both sides  stick to the issues. “Grumpiness arises where folks feel that we’re not talking about issues but personalities or character.”  Obama, a Democrat, issued his most extensive analysis to date of his own party’s race, while refusing to take sides. He rejected a suggestion that beating Trump would get more difficult as the two parties’ conventions approach in July, a period when the Democratic victor can focus on fighting Trump instead of the fellow Democrat, adding that the Democrat battle was tough. “Arguing against your friends is more draining than arguing against political opponents,” Obama said. He said there were no big ideological differences between Clinton, an establishment candidate who is a former First Lady and senator, and Sanders, a firebrand populist who identifies as a Democratic Socialist. The president said it was important that the race eventually end in a way “that leaves both sides feeling proud of what they’ve done.” ",1

"Even more shocking than the number of Muslim refugees vs. Christian refugees being transplanted to the U.S., is the fact that Catholic and Lutheran charities are the top two organizations benefitting from this billion dollar business.

" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a wide-ranging request for documents and analysis, President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team asked the Department of Homeland Security last month to assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction.  The team also asked about the department’s capacity for expanding immigrant detention and about an aerial surveillance program that was scaled back by the Obama administration but remains popular with immigration hardliners. And it asked whether federal workers have altered biographic information kept by the department about immigrants out of concern for their civil liberties.  DON'T MISS: Megyn Kelly leaving Fox News to join NBC Reuters TV: Trump fears grow in Mexico valley where dollar is king The requests were made in a Dec. 5 meeting between Trump’s transition team and Department of Homeland Security officials, according to an internal agency memo reviewed by Reuters. The document offers a glimpse into the president-elect’s strategy for securing the U.S. borders and reversing polices put in place by the Obama administration.   Trump’s transition team did not comment in response to Reuters inquiries. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to comment.       In response to the transition team request, U.S. Customs and Border Protection staffers identified more than 400 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border, and about the same distance along the U.S.-Canada border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by Reuters.      Reuters could not determine whether the Trump team is considering a northern border barrier. During the campaign, Trump pledged to build a wall and expand fencing on parts of the U.S.-Mexico border but said he sees no need to build a wall on the border with Canada.  One program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was Operation Phalanx, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1,200 Army National Guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration.  The program once deployed 6,000 airmen under President George W. Bush but was downsized by Barack Obama, a move blasted by some conservatives who argue the surveillance is vital to border security.        The transition team also asked for copies of every executive order and directive sent to immigration agents since Obama took office in 2009, according to the memo summarizing the meeting.      Trump has said he intends to undo Obama’s executive actions on immigration, including a 2012 order to allow children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents to remain in the country on temporary authorizations that allow them to attend college and work.  The program, known as DACA, collected information including participants’ addresses that could theoretically be used to locate and deport them if the policy is reversed. Another request of the transition team was for information about whether any migrant records have been changed for any reason, including for civil rights or civil liberties concerns, according to the internal memo seen by Reuters.      A Department of Homeland Security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency interpreted the request to mean the transition team wanted to make sure that federal workers were not tampering with information to protect DACA recipients and other migrants from deportation.  On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to deport more undocumented immigrants, a promise that may have prompted the transition team’s request for information about the feasibility of expanding temporary detention facilities.      The internal memo summarizing the meeting between Trump’s transition team and U.S. Customs and Border protection said the team had requested a comprehensive picture of border security as well as resources available for walls and barriers.  The Department of Homeland Security official said agency representatives who attended the meeting believed the request to include both the northern and southern borders. U.S. Customs and Border Protection then prepared a report on specific locations and costs of building a fence along the U.S.-Canada border.  Reuters reviewed a copy of the report, which estimated the cost of building fencing along the northern border fence would be $3.3 billion and cover 452 miles along border of Canada and the states of Washington, Idaho, Montana, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.     Adding 413 miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive, according to the estimate of $11.37 billion, because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing.  Pedestrian fences require more staff and would cost $11.2 million per mile versus $4.1 million per mile to build to build, according to the report.  In fiscal year 2015, the latest year for which data is available, border patrol agents apprehended 2,626 illegal migrants on the U.S.-Canada border compared to 331,333 apprehended on the U.S.-Mexico border.

"Despite the damage that the presidency of George W.

This can clearly be seen with the excitement and electricity generated when Barack Obama ran for and then won the presidency. The world realizes the influence the United States exerts on the planet and thus looks very closely at our political developments, especially when it relates to presidential candidates.Thus, much of the world has been alarmed and scared by the rise of Donald Trump, a man who has promised to do all sorts of crazy thing once he becomes president. He won t rule out using nuclear weapons, he s repeatedly insulted and threatened Mexicans with his stupid wall, he wants to kick start an arms race, he wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Islamophobia would be state policy, and he wants to punish women who have abortions.As is stated in the video below: If Trump actually makes it to the White House, there s only one thing you can predict about this wholly unpredictable man: There will be a surge in what people will call anti-American-ism. People will mock the nation as dumb, vulgar, and aggressive. It will be like it was in the Geroge W. Bush years, only much much worse. We don t need another Bush, or someone who can actually be worse if that s even possible.

"WASHINGTON/BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s ouster of chief strategist Steve Bannon is unlikely to mark the abandonment of the administration’s “America First” agenda that has unnerved investors and trade partners and split the White House into nationalist and globalist camps. Within hours of leaving Trump’s administration on Friday, Bannon was back at the helm of Breitbart News, the hard-right news site he ran before becoming the main architect of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Bannon can now do more to further conservative causes because “he can speak his mind” without the constraints of working in the White House, Rick Weatherly, 61, a maintenance technician from the Denver suburb of Lakewood, said on Saturday. Trump appeared to agree, tweeting: “Steve Bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at @BreitbartNews ... maybe even better than ever before. Fake News needs the competition!” Bannon, 63, was instrumental in some of Trump’s most contentious policies including the travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations, departure from the Paris climate accord and rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He was no friend to the Republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals, but became a darling of some of the president’s hard-line conservative supporters.  “Trump will now have a great external ally,” a source close to Bannon said on condition of anonymity. “He will use his big hammer against the congressional leadership in support of the president’s agenda.” Trump supporters in south Florida, Chicago and Colorado told Reuters that they were not concerned that Bannon’s departure meant the president was distancing himself from policies he supported during last year’s campaign. “I think Trump will be fine,” said Bob Janda, a 67-year-old small business owner in Chicago.             Nor is Bannon likely to be distanced from Trump’s ear, a White House official said on condition of anonymity. Bannon joined a string of senior officials who have left the Trump administration in the past five weeks, leading to the appointment of retired Marine general John Kelly as the new White House chief of staff. Kelly has succeeded in imposing some order on what had been a haphazard operation, but Bannon will still have “a direct pipeline into the Oval Office with Breitbart, Twitter and the TV,” the same White House official added.     “My guess is he’ll (Bannon) probably be more effective goading the president from outside, especially if the president feels boxed in by John Kelly’s clean lines of authority and (national security adviser H.R.) McMaster’s orderly processes,” said Kori Schake, a research fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution who previously served in the White House. “Seems to me that Bannon was symptom not cause: The president seems to share his dark vision, revel in the support of people Bannon represents,” Schake added. Prior to joining the Trump campaign, Bannon had spearheaded Breitbart’s shift into a forum for the “alt-right,” a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His departure capped a tumultuous week in which Trump was widely criticized for saying both sides were responsible for last weekend’s violence at a Charlottesville, Virginia rally organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Bannon told the conservative Weekly Standard on Friday that he would use Breitbart to attack opponents of the populist and nationalist agenda he championed, including establishment Republicans.  At the same time he appeared to suggest that his departure signaled a major shift for the Trump agenda. “The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” Bannon said. Defense policy is one area where Bannon could play a role from the outside.   While many of Trump’s national security aides favor sending several thousand more troops to Afghanistan, where the Taliban insurgents have been regaining ground, Bannon argued for withdrawing the 8,400 U.S. personnel still there. He also had advocated restraint in dealing with North Korea, rejecting the use of military force to solve the recent crisis. “There is a danger that if he continues to bang away on issues that appeal to Breitbart’s audience but aren’t going anywhere, Bannon risks splitting the administration’s loose coalition of hard-right ideologues, traditional conservatives, and middle-of-the-road voters who didn’t like Hillary Clinton,” another Trump administration official said, also on condition of anonymity.

"In typical Obama fashion, the extravagant tax-payer funded Nordic state dinner looked more like an after-party for the Academy Awards than a state function. How is anyone supposed to take this ass-clown seriously when he has turned our White House into a playground for the  who s who  in the Hollywood Communist party? But then again, nothing Obama does is for the good of our country, it always has been, and will continue to be, all about him until he and his sorry excuse for a family exit the White House. I m sure the sight of pop singer Demi Lovato and comedian Aziz Ansar with Nordic leaders at the White House left Putin shaking in his boots President Obama and the First Lady have welcomed five Nordic leaders to the White House for a lavish state dinner after earlier putting on a show of unity against Vladimir Putin s recent military aggression in the Baltics.The Obamas first welcomed Icelandic Prime Minister Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson   who has only been in charge of his country for a month   and his wife Ingibjorg Elsa Ingjaldsdottir as they arrived at the North Portico of the White House.They were swiftly followed by the prime ministers of Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway, who were also invited to the unusual   if a little crowded   meeting.The dinner will send a strong statement to Russia, who the five heads of state earlier slammed for its military buildup   including the buzzing of a U.S. warship near Kaliningrad   as they called for economic sanctions against Moscow to be maintained.Here s a peak into the Academy Awards after party Nordic State dinner. True to our divisive President s nature, there wasn t a single Republican invited to the affair.More than 300 guests   including actor Will Ferrell, David Letterman and former NBA star Alonzo Mourning   were invited to the dinner.Ferrell, who attended the dinner with his Swedish wife, Vivica Paulin, said it was his first time at the White House.  I hope we don t do anything wrong,  he joked.Also expected are Girls actress Allison Williams, Scandal star Bellamy Young, singer Janelle Monae and former Victoria s Secret model Miranda Kerr, as well as a smattering of Nordic celebrities.

"Just another member of the swamp who s about to be sucked down the drain In 2015, leftist rag Politico called it a  Big hire  when Jeb Bush landed Tim Miller as his top communications aide.Jeb Bush plans to name Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising PAC, as his top communications aide, Republican sources told POLITICO on Friday.Miller initially will be a senior adviser to Bush s Right to Rise PAC, and is expected to become communications director if Bush launches his campaign. Kristy Campbell, who has been the PAC s chief spokesperson, likely will be national press secretary of the campaign, or have some senior communications adviser role.Now, thanks to Big League Politics, every member of the GOP can see the type of traitors to the Republican Party Jeb Bush hired to work on his campaign.A Friday Big League Politics report claims Tim Miller, a Republican operative prominent in the  Never Trump  movement, helped pitch the Washington Post story in which the first allegations of sexual misconduct nearly 40 years ago were made against Alabama GOP senatorial nominee Roy Moore.The report contains screenshots of what are alleged to be text messages between Miller and conservative publisher Charles C. Johnson of GotNews.com. The texts show Miller insulting Judge Moore s fitness for office and bragging about how  Beth  is  good to work with.  He is implied to be referring to Beth Reinhard, one of the two authors of the original Washington Post story.Reinhard, before joining the Washington Post, worked at the Wall Street Journal during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries as the embedded reporter covering the Bush campaign. She, therefore, likely had regular interaction with Miller since at least 2015.Miller, who served as Jeb Bush s communications director in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries, categorically denies any involvement in the Washington Post story. He told Breitbart News:I had no involvement in pitching the Washington Post story or any others where women spoke out about Judge Moore. Moore allies have tried to pitch this to 10+ outlets, conservative and mainstream, who have all rejected the story after examining the facts because there is no truth to it.Big League Politics Editor-in-Chief Patrick Howley makes his case as follows:These text messages reveal a few things: the Republican Establishment s relationship with the Post s anti-Moore coverage, the cunning of writer Charles Johnson in trapping Miller, and former Bush staffer Miller s cluelessness about how to conduct himself in the world of political subterfuge. Miller denied to BLP that he was involved in the Washington Post story  or any others where women spoke out about Judge Moore,  but the text messages below leave no doubt as to his involvement [sic][.]During and after the 2016 primaries, Miller was one of the leading voices against eventual GOP nominee Donald Trump. He played a role in the decidedly unsuccessful attempt by Never Trumpers to disregard the will of Republican voters and deny Trump the nomination through the use of convention rules.Miller remains an outspoken critic of Trump and consistently opposes Republicans of the pro-Trump or populist-nationalist bent. He has frequently appeared on cable news programs as an anti-trump Republican voice and now is one of far-left Salon.com s 25 favorite  conservatives. Miller has aggressively campaigned for Judge Moore s liberal Democratic opponent Doug Jones. on Twitter, announcing last month that he had donated money to Jones:I just donated to a Democrat for the first time in my life if any of yall want to do so as well. Enough is enough. https://t.co/YlDXTXSnyJ  Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 21, 2017 ",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump signed a temporary order on Thursday to keep the U.S. embassy in Israel in Tel Aviv instead of relocating it to Jerusalem, despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial move. After months of fierce debate within his administration, Trump chose to continue his predecessors’ policy of signing a six-month waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the embassy be transferred to Jerusalem, an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The White House insisted, however, that the decision, which is sure to disappoint Israel’s U.S. supporters, did not mean Trump was abandoning the goal of eventually shifting the embassy to Jerusalem. But a U.S. official said no timetable has been set. “The question is not if that move happens, but only when,” the White House said in a statement. With a deadline looming, Trump made the decision to defer action on the embassy “to maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, fulfilling his solemn obligation to defend America’s national security interests,” the White House said. Palestinian leaders, Arab governments and Western allies had urged Trump not to proceed with the embassy relocation, which would have upended decades of U.S. policy by granting what would have been seen as de facto U.S. recognition of Israel’s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital. “Though Israel is disappointed that the embassy will not move at this time, we appreciate today’s expression of President Trump’s friendship to Israel and his commitment to moving the embassy in the future,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Taking a harder stance, Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, a far-right member of Netanyahu’s coalition, said delaying the move would “damage the prospect of a lasting peace by nurturing false expectations among the Palestinians regarding the division of Jerusalem, which will never happen.” Nabil Abu Rdainah, a close aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said Trump’s decision “reaffirms the seriousness of the United States in its efforts to achieve peace.” Trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to Israel and the West Bank in May. Despite that, most experts are skeptical of Trump’s chances for achieving a peace deal that had eluded other U.S. presidents. The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally. Israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Jerusalem is home to sites considered holy by the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Successive U.S. administrations have insisted that Jerusalem’s status must be decided in negotiations. On the campaign trail, Trump’s pro-Israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy. But after he took office in January, the issue lost momentum as he met Arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long-stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator. Some of Trump’s top aides pushed for him to keep his campaign promise to satisfy the pro-Israel, right-wing base that helped him win the presidency. The State Department, however recommended against an embassy move, one U.S. official said. “No one should consider this step to be in any way a retreat from the president’s strong support for Israel,” according to the White House statement on the signing of the waiver.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned on Monday night in the midst of a raging controversy about his contacts with Russian officials before Trump took office, a White House official said. Retired General Keith Kellogg, who has been the chief of staff at the National Security Council, has been named acting national security adviser.   ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it was urging Saudi Arabia to be  fair and transparent  in its handling of any prosecutions stemming from a sweeping corruption probe that has resulted in the arrests of dozens of top Saudi officials. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the United States had no advance knowledge of the corruption crackdown that unfolded over the weekend and resulted in the detention of members of the royal family, ministers and investors, including prominent billionaire businessman Alwaleed bin Talal.  We continue to encourage Saudi authorities to pursue the prosecution of people they believe to have been corrupt officials; we expect them to do it in a fair and transparent manner,  Nauert told a briefing.  We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to do that.  Nauert said the United States had received assurances from the Saudi government that it would do so, but another U.S. official later told reporters that she had misspoken and that they had no such assurances that they could discuss in public. Asked about Saudi Arabia s increasingly tough talk toward Iran and Lebanon, Nauert pointed to what she said was Iran s destabilizing activity and the Lebanese Hezbollah group s past record of attacks against U.S. military personnel. Saudi Arabia accused Lebanon on Monday of declaring war against it because of aggression by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shi ite group backed by Iran. Saad al-Hariri, the Saudi-allied Lebanese prime minister, resigned on Saturday, blaming Iran and Hezbollah in his resignation speech. Nauert told reporters that Lebanon was a strong U.S. partner. Hezbollah has influential ties across Lebanon. Hariri s coalition government, which took office last year, grouped nearly all Lebanon s main parties, including Hezbollah. Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, is president.  The United States strongly supports the legitimate institutions in the Lebanese state,  Nauert said.  We expect all members of the international community to respect fully those institutions and the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon.  ",1

Lebanese President Michel Aoun on Wednesday said Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia.  ",1
"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary s right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban accepted his ruling Fidesz party s endorsement on Sunday to lead it into an election next year, saying he needed another four year term in power to make his transformation of the country  irreversible . Orban, who has steered Hungary into confrontation with the European Union by campaigning against immigration, asserting control over the media and courts, and criticizing efforts to deepen European integration, received a unanimous 1,358 votes at a party congress to remain Fidesz leader for two more years. With an election five months away, he leads all contenders and looks likely to secure a third consecutive landslide.  There is no mood for a change of government in Hungary, so much as a mood for a change of opposition,  Orban said to laughter and applause, referring to disarray within the center-left. [nL8N1MD2V9] Polls show the center-left likely to be overtaken at the next election by the far-right Jobbik party, seen as leaning even further towards ethnic nationalism than Orban s Fidesz.  We need to work for four more years to strengthen our achievements to the point that they are irreversible,  Orban said. The 54-year-old premier has been widely criticized by Western allies for eroding democratic freedoms, which he and Fidesz deny. He has become unassailably popular at home, especially since 2015, when Hungary became the main land route into the EU for around a million Middle Eastern migrants who crossed the Balkans on their way to Germany and other rich countries further north. Orban and Fidesz say hostility towards them is being whipped up as part of a conspiracy by George Soros, a Hungarian-American financier who has long contributed to  open society  causes around the world, including in his native Eastern Europe. In his speech accepting his party s endorsement, Orban said he was fighting against  globalist  views that threaten the EU s Christian nations and their moral foundations, for which he blamed Soros.  Some countries in Europe decided to transcend Christianity and their own national character,  he said.  They want to step into a post-Christian, post-national era.   To execute Soros s plan they want to root out governments which represent national interests around Europe, and that includes us,  he said.  They act like Soviet agitprop agents once did. We old war-horses know them by their smell.  ",1
"On this Thanksgiving, I would like to address an open letter to the multimillionaire National Football League players who continue to take a knee when  The Star-Spangled Banner  is played.Dear kneeling brothers,As a proud Army veteran, mom and black American, I thank God that I live in the greatest nation on Earth. For me, Thanksgiving doesn t just come once a year. I m thankful 365 days a year.You make far, far more money than almost all Americans   regardless of race. Kids look up to you as heroes. You appear on TV and in the media.Yet, you keep on protesting   refusing to rise and respect our national anthem and respect the men and women like me who serve or have served in our military.I was willing to die for my country when I put on the Army uniform. And you re not even willing to stand up for a short song? This is too much of a sacrifice for you?One of the many lessons I ve learned along the way is that there is no place on the planet like America. She is not perfect, because we are not perfect. Yet, she is a consummate beacon of light, set upon a hill, for nations who look to her for hope, dignity and direction.You big guys should appreciate that   and pause for a few moments to express your patriotism and love for our great nation when our national anthem is played and our flag flies before thousands of people who have paid good money to see you run around a field chasing a little ball.Let me tell you about me. I m not as big and strong as you, but I stepped forward to join the Army to fight for your right to play games in peace.Weeks before I graduated from the Army s basic training program, I had an epiphany: I could be deployed to war. Would I go? Would I put my life on the line for someone else?It didn t take me long to come to a resounding Yes! If called, I would go.But I gave myself an assignment. If I was going to potentially give life or limb to defend this great country, I would need to know what, exactly, I was defending. I am still learning.One of the lessons I ve learned about America is more of a personal lesson. I am not a victim. My two beautiful black babies are not victims. Black Americans are not victims.We are victors   not so much because of anything we have done, but because of those who came before us. Slaves in chains, treated like farm animals, to be  owned  by others. And after Emancipation, those who endured the humiliation of drinking out of the  dirty  water fountain or taking their child into the  colored  restroom.Those who were spat upon or cursed out solely because they were deemed the  wrong  color. Those who had to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar to be eligible to vote, notwithstanding their college education.Those who were hosed down, billy-clubbed across the head or attacked by trained dogs just because they walked across a bridge.Those who were aroused from their sleep to see hate-filled men covered in white sheets, a cross burning in their front yard and their neighbor calling out for their son.Those who, oftentimes, paid the ultimate sacrifice   not for their own benefit, but for the joy that was set before them.We, today, are the joy that was set before them. And, how do you repay them for their sacrifice to be treated as equal under the law? You have chosen to take a knee.If you followed the rhetoric we hear today, America is not far removed from those Jim Crow days of legalized discrimination against black people.If you closed your eyes and just listened to the blistering speeches coming from Antifa, the Black Lives Matter folks and many politicians, you would think we re not even 40 years removed from slavery itself.The narrative behind  Hands Up, Don t Shoot  perpetuates the storyline that around every street corner there s a police officer waiting to shoot a black man. It is these narratives that have given life to you NFL players kneeling during our national anthem.If there was truth behind these narratives, then I would readily support you black millionaire athletes using your national platform to shine a bright light on the systemic racism against the black community.But we re not living in 1850 or 1950. Racism is certainly not dead, but it s not the powerful monster backed by all the resources of government either. And you guys are not exactly downtrodden, going hungry, being shoved to the back of the bus, or used for target practice by Ku Klux Klansmen dressed up like cops.Allow me to make a few suggestions to you as an alternative to continuing to disrespect our country and flag. If you want to make a real difference that extends beyond getting your picture on a magazine cover, please consider doing the following.First, invest in black urban schools, to help them pay for the educational programs and enhanced learning opportunities that wealthy suburban schools have to help their students succeed.Second, commit to providing mentoring and college scholarships for 20, 10 or even just one child in the inner city, from elementary school through high school and into college. You will change their futures.Third, take $1 million or $2 million   not all of your vast wealth   and invest it into creating jobs, businesses and entrepreneurial internships to help black people achieve the American Dream. Find ways to personally take your millions directly into a distressed community and invest.Fourth, take a family out of the inner city by giving them a mortgage-free home. Consider the ripple effect of good this stand would have on the lives of an entire family for generations to come.Fifth, educate yourselves and then others on what the Democratic Party has done to the black community. I have yet to find an inner city run by conservatives. Yet I see one Democratic politician after another representing some of the most distressed communities. These politicians themselves usually do not live in those distressed communities and often live in expensive homes while their kids attend private schools.Teach yourselves and others to hold elected officials accountable. Be determined to no longer fall prey to their sleight-of-hand manipulations that only serve to distract you from their lack of effort to make real changes in the black community.Doing just one of these things would make an indelible imprint on any community, especially the black community.So instead of taking a knee, take a stand to stomp out poverty by investing in businesses, by creating an environment that promotes family stability, and by fanning the flames of hope, dignity and direction into the lives of some of our most depressed citizens.By the grace of God, I was never called into war during my Army service. I know many others who were. Some did not return whole. So, while I can t play pro football, I have two legs, two arms and a brain that tells me to appreciate and love the United States of America.For all this I am thankful, and I think you should be too.Happy Thanksgiving,Kathy Barnette",0
"It s interesting how much vitriol some women harbor for successful men who date beautiful women, as though it s somehow evil  and mysoginist to date beautiful women. If Trump only dated unattractive women would that somehow make him a better candidate? One of the women quoted in a New York Times article headlined  Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private  is pushing back Monday and saying that she was taken out of context and Trump never made her feel uncomfortable.The piece   which was published Saturday   begins with the line  Donald J. Trump had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to change out of her clothes. It then continues with a scene illustrated by Brewer Lane about a 1990 pool party at Trump s Florida beach club. He suddenly took me by the hand, and he started to show me around the mansion. He asked me if I had a swimsuit with me. I said no. I hadn t intended to swim. He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on a swimsuit. But Brewer Lane disputed the way she is portrayed Monday in an interview with Fox & Friends. The New York Times told us several times that they would make sure my story that I was telling came across, they promised several times that they would do it accurately, they told me several times and my manager several times that it would not be a hit piece and that my story would come across the way that I was telling it and honestly and it absolutely was not,  Brewer Lane said.  They did take quotes from what I said and they put a negative connotation on it. They spun it to where it appeared negative. I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump. Brewer Lane dated Trump and said that the presumptive Republican nominee  never made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way, he never offended me in any way. WATCH HERE:  Obviously they feel like they need to do something to make him look bad or go along with their article,  Brewer Lane said. Why do you think the left   the mainstream media   is so obsessed with just creating this headline about how Donald Trump treats women?  host Ainsley Earhardt asked. I don t know. I think that they re just reaching for straws,  Brewer Lane said, adding that her manager has reached out to the reporter to say they would be telling her side of the story.

"(Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday: The United States drops a massive GBU-43 bomb, the largest non-nuclear bomb it has ever used in combat, in Afghanistan against a series of caves used by Islamic State militants, the Pentagon says. Trump says Pyongyang is a problem that “will be taken care of” amid speculation that North Korea is on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. Military force cannot resolve tension over North Korea, China warns, while an influential Chinese newspaper urges Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program in exchange for Beijing’s protection. The Trump administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials say. Trump says “things will work out fine” between the United States and Russia, a day after declaring U.S.-Russian relations may be at an all-time low. Trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair as he considers his choices for the U.S. central bank. [nL1N1HL14B] Trump signs a resolution that will allow U.S. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen presses Deutsche Bank to release information about issues including Trump’s debt and any bank meetings with Trump administration officials, saying he has “great concern” about possible conflicts of interest. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK Trump’s office says he plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, a victory for American manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co that have overseas customers that use the agency’s government-backed loans to purchase their products. Top Wall Street bankers say they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in Washington, and downplay the idea U.S. policymakers may force their institutions to split up. The United States is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with Japan, a source says, an unwelcome development for Tokyo, which is seeking to fend off U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. Trump’s administration has focused on one group of illegal immigrants more than others: women with children, according to eight Department of Homeland Security officials interviewed by Reuters about agency planning.

"Workers at PT Buma, the Korean-owned garment factory in Subang, Indonesia, responsible for creating the pieces that make up Ivanka Trump s fashion label, told in personal interviews with The Guardian of the horrendous conditions they are forced to endure working for Donald Trump s daughter.PT Buma started in Indonesia in 1999 and is one of the suppliers to G-III Apparel Group, the wholesale manufacturer for Ivanka Trump s brand, among others. Earning 2.3 million rupiahs, the equivalent of around $173 a month, employees bring home one of the lowest minimum wages in Asia and workers reported regularly working unpaid overtime while trying to meet impossibly high production targets. The management is getting smarter: they tap out our ID cards at 4 p.m. so you can t prove anything,  said Wilden, a 25-year-old male employee.Another clever tactic used is avoiding paying bonuses for religious holidays by simply firing the employees just before them. Indonesia is a Muslim country and the factory s management has been accused of firing employees before the holy month of Ramadan, only to rehire them again at the month s end. When employees are working, however, they are often referred to by derogatory names such as  animals,   moron  and  monkey  by factory management and suffer through what has been described as  violations of women s rights .When Alia, one of the 2,759 workers at PT Buma, was explained the general idea of Ivanka Trump s new book on women in the workplace, she burst out laughing. Her idea of work-life balance, she said, would be if she could see her children more than once a month.To make matters worse, of those 2,759 workers, only around 200 are unionized, split between two different unions. Of the non-union workers, around three-quarters are women who, like Alia, spend almost all of their income on their children, children they can t even afford to see, let alone even live with.Another such worker is Sita, 23, who will soon be terminated after seven months work and will receive no severance. That s one of the company s ways to cope with extra expenses,  Sita said.  I can t stand it anymore. I work unpaid overtime every day and still earn just 2.3 million [rupiah] a month. I m planning to move from Subang, where the minimum wage is too low. But I don t know where to go yet. I haven t got any connections. Don t be fooled, though, PT Buma factory workers know exactly who they are working for and they don t like it. Ahmad, an observant Muslim who works at the factory with his wife, as well as many of his other family members, said  We don t like Donald Trump s policies,  in reference to the president s Muslim travel ban, which he had been following on TV. But we re not in a position to make employment decisions based on our principles,  Ahmad said.These latest complaints come just weeks after one activist was arrested and several others went missing in May while attempting to investigate a separate factory that makes Ivanka Trump-branded shoes in China.Featured image via Clemens Bilan   Pool /Getty Images",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump accused predecessor Barack Obama on Saturday of wiretapping him during the late stages of the 2016 election campaign, but offered no evidence for an allegation which an Obama spokesman said was “simply false”. Trump made the accusation in a series of early morning tweets just weeks into his administration and amid rising scrutiny of his campaign’s ties to Russia. “How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!,” Trump wrote in one tweet. “I’d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” The remarkable tussle between the current and former presidents just 45 days since the handover of power is the latest twist in a controversy over ties between Trump associates and Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump’s favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Trump has accused officials in Obama’s administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said it had been a “cardinal rule” of the Obama administration that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. “Neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false,” Lewis said in a statement. The statement did not address the possibility that a wiretap of the Trump campaign could have been ordered by Justice Department officials. Trump said the alleged wiretapping took place in his Trump Tower office and apartment building in New York, but there was “nothing found.” The White House did not respond to a request to elaborate on Trump’s accusations. Trump was spending the weekend at his Florida seaside resort, Mar-a-Lago. He was scheduled to meet with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly before a dinner with officials also including adviser Steve Bannon and White House Counsel Don McGahn, the White House said. Amid a political storm, Sessions on Thursday announced he would stay out of any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election after it emerged he met last year with Russia’s ambassador, although he maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose the meeting. A Trump spokeswoman said the president spent part of Saturday “having meetings, making phone calls and hitting balls” at his golf course in West Palm Beach. His supporters, meanwhile, staged small rallies in at least 28 of the country’s 50 states, most of which passed off peacefully. But there were clashes in the famously left-leaning city of Berkeley, California, where protesters from both sides hit each other over the head with wooden sticks. Trump’s tweets caught his aides by surprise, with one saying it was unclear what the president was referring to. Members of Congress said Trump’s accusations require investigation or explanation. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican, described the allegations as serious and said the public deserved more information. He said in a statement it was possible that Trump had been illegally tapped, but, if so, the president should explain what sort of tap it was and how he knew about it. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called Trump’s assertion a “spectacularly reckless allegation”. “If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation’s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them,” Schiff said in a statement. Former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes strongly denied Trump’s allegations: “No president can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you,” Rhodes wrote on Twitter. Trump’s administration has come under pressure from Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional investigations into contacts between some members of his campaign team and Russian officials during his campaign.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he had no knowledge of any wiretapping but was “very worried” about the suggestion Obama had acted illegally and would also be concerned “if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity.” Several other Republicans again urged an investigation into a series of intelligence-related leaks. Obama imposed sanctions on Russia and ordered Russian diplomats to leave the United States in December over the country’s involvement in hacking political parties in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Under U.S. law, a federal court would have to have found probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an “agent of a foreign power” in order to approve a warrant authorizing electronic surveillance of Trump Tower. Several conservative news outlets and commentators have made allegations in recent days about Trump being wiretapped during the campaign, without offering any evidence. Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned in February after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office.   Flynn had promised Vice President Mike Pence he had not discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russians, but transcripts of intercepted communications, described by U.S. officials, showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the Russian ambassador.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson’s comments that President Barack Obama was “raised white” prompted backlash on social media on Tuesday, with many users criticizing the neurosurgeon for stereotyping the experience of African-Americans. Carson, who is black and grew up poor in Detroit in the 1960s, said of Obama in a podcast posted on Politico’s website, “He was, you know, raised white.” He added, “I mean, like most Americans, I was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected, but … he didn’t grow up like I grew up … Many of his formative years were spent in Indonesia. So, for him to, you know, claim that, you know, he identifies with the experience of black Americans, I think, is a bit of a stretch.” Several Twitter users expressed anger over the remarks.   Keith Simmons (@Foreignstorian) said “You cannot distill the black experience into something so narrow. Being ‘poor’ or ‘rich’ does not grant authenticity.” Warren Holstein ‏(@WarrenHolstein) said, “Ben Carson says Obama was “raised white” and doesn’t understand black Americans. That fails to explain why no one understands Ben Carson.” Shaun King (@ShaunKing), civil rights activist and New York Daily News writer, said, “Please @RealBenCarson. Step away from ALL microphones...forever. Saying Obama “grew up white” is foolishness.” The comments also prompted some to contemplate Obama’s upbringing. Brahma Chellaney ‏(@Chellaney) said, “I’ve often wondered why Obama is regarded as black, not mixed race, despite a white mother and a white upbringing.” Carson did not back away from his comments in an interview with CNN on Tuesday afternoon. “Anybody who is sensible knows that the way that he was brought up is very different from the way most black people in this country are brought up,” he said, adding, “I don’t think anyone would deny that someone who was raised in Hawaii by his white grandparents and then spent formative years in Indonesia with his white mother does not have the typical black experience.” For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, “Tales from the Trail” (here).

This was ignored for years. This wound became apparent now with [the current developments in] Syria and will fester for a long time before we will get rid of it,  de Wever said. According to September 2014 statistics from Belgium s Ministry of Interior, between 300 and 350 Belgians have gone to fight alongside the ISIL in Iraq and Syria since 2012. Via: Gateway Pundit",0
"MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin flew into Syria and ordered  a significant part  of Moscow s military contingent there to start withdrawing on Monday, declaring their work largely done. Putin, who polls show will be re-elected comfortably in March, made the announcement during a surprise visit to Russia s Hmeymim air base in Syria - his first since Russia intervened in the conflict. He held talks with President Bashar al-Assad and addressed Russian forces. The first leg in a three-country one-day whirlwind diplomatic visit which sees Putin also meeting his Egyptian and Turkish counterparts, Putin is keen to leverage the heightened Middle East influence that Syria has given him to cast himself as a leader who can do diplomacy as well as military force. The Kremlin first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015 in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in Assad s favor. Now that it regards that mission complete, Putin wants to help broker a peace deal.    In just over two years, Russia s armed forces and the Syrian army have defeated the most battle-hardened group of international terrorists,  Putin told Russian servicemen.  A  significant part  of the Russian force could now return home.  The conditions for a political solution under the auspices of the United Nations have been created,  said Putin.  The Motherland awaits you.  Washington was skeptical about Putin s statement.  Russian comments about removal of their forces do not often correspond with actual troop reductions, and do not affect U.S. priorities in Syria,  said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon. Putin made clear in any case that Russia would retain enough firepower to destroy any possible Islamic State comeback. Syrian state television quoted Assad as thanking Putin for Russia s help, saying the blood of Moscow s  martyrs  had been mixed with the blood of the Syrian army. It also showed the two men watching what it called a victory parade with Russian troops dressed in desert uniforms marching past. Russia s main contribution has been air strikes, and with Iran-backed Shi ite militias doing much of the fighting on the ground, the partial Russian withdrawal may not make a huge difference when it comes to the military situation. Russia s campaign, which has been extensively covered on state TV at home, has not caught the imagination of most Russians. But nor has it stirred unease of the kind the Soviet Union faced with its calamitous 1980s Afghanistan intervention.  The use of private military contractors, something which has been documented by Reuters but denied by the defense ministry, has allowed Moscow to keep the public casualty toll fairly low.  Officially, less than 50 Russian service personnel have been killed in the campaign, but the real number, including private contractors, is estimated to be much higher.   Russia s  mission accomplished  moment in Syria may help Putin increase the turnout at the March presidential election by appealing to the patriotism of voters.          Though polls show he will easily win, they also show that some Russians are increasingly apathetic about politics, and Putin s supporters are keen to get him re-elected on a big turnout, which in their eyes confers legitimacy. Putin, who with the help of state TV has dominated Russia s political landscape for the last 17 years, told Russian servicemen they would return home as victors.    Speaking in front of a row of servicemen holding Russian flags, Putin said his military had proved its might and that Moscow had succeeded in keeping Syria intact as a  sovereign independent state.   I congratulate you!  Putin told the servicemen. Putin is keen to organize a special event in Russia - the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue - that Moscow hopes will bring together the Syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution.  When asked about Putin s announcement, Yahya Aridi, spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Geneva, said it welcomed any step that brought Syria closer to real peace.    Putin made clear however that while Russia might be drawing down much of its forces, its military presence in Syria was a permanent one and that it would retain enough firepower to destroy any Islamic State comeback. Russia will keep its Hmeymim air base in Syria s Latakia Province and its naval facility in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartous  on a permanent basis,  said Putin. Both bases are protected by sophisticated air defense missile systems. Putin was told by the military that it had begun withdrawing 25 aircraft, a detachment of Russian military police, a detachment of Russian special forces, a military field hospital and a de-mining center.  However, Russia has announced partial force draw-downs before only to later bring in different capabilities.  We ve seen such announcements before, which turn about to be less significant than they might have initially appeared,  said one European diplomat who declined to be named.  The most significant contribution Russia can make to advancing peace in Syria is to pressure the Assad regime to engage seriously in Geneva (peace talks). Absent that, the suspicion will be that this announcement may have more to do with Russian politics than the Syrian situation.  ",1
"The hypocrisy of our media is astounding! What about Hillary s major corporate donors like GE for example, that have been working the loopholes in our tax system for decades? Does anyone care that Hillary has been taking money from some of America s biggest corporate tax dodgers for several years? Bernie Sanders recently outed the 10 biggest multinational corporations that paid no federal taxes for at least one year between 2008 and 2012. Sanders has made reining in corporate tax dodgers a key point of his presidential platform. In a recent press release, the Sanders campaign laid out the Vermont senator s plans to force multinational corporations to pay their fair share in taxes:As it turns out, all ten of those same companies are some of Hillary Clinton s biggest donors, whether to her campaign or to her family foundation.1. GENERAL ELECTRIC According to data from the nonpartisan group Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), GE posted $33.9 billion in U.S. profits, yet somehow got $2.9 billion in refunds in that same time period. According to the book Clinton Cash, then-Secretary of State Clinton lobbied the Algerian government for a GE power plant contract. After Algeria awarded the contract to GE, Jeffrey Immelt   CEO of GE   gave a donation to the Clinton Foundation. Sanders also pointed out that while Immelt sat on the board of the New York Federal Reserve, the Fed gave GE $16 billion in financial assistance.2. BOEING Boeing is one of the nation s biggest corporate tax dodgers, making over $20 billion in profits between 2008 and 2012 and paying an overall income tax rate of negative one percent during those years. Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer noted that after Secretary Clinton successfully lobbied the Russian government to enter into a $3.7 billion contract to buy Boeing s aircraft, the aerospace company gave the Clinton Foundation a hefty donation of $900,000.3. VERIZON In the four years between 2008 and 2012, Verizon pocketed over $30 billion in profits and paid a tax rate of -1.8 percent, according to CTJ. The Sanders campaign s research claims that in 2012 alone, Verizon would have paid $630 million in income taxes had they been unable to stash U.S. profits in offshore tax havens.Verizon has given between $118,000 and $300,000 to the Clinton Foundation in recent years. And as Zaid Jilani reported in Alternet last year, Hillary Clinton is the favored candidate of numerous Verizon executives, many of whom have given the maximum donation to her 2016 effort:Verizon vice-presidents Lydia Pulley, Kathleen Grillo, and Donna Epps each gave $2,700 to Hillary for America. Verizon senior vice-president Thomas Edwards and vice-president Chris Debosier pitched in $1,000. Leecia Eve, a former Hillary staffer who today is a lobbyist for Verizon gave $2,700. Another Verizon lobbyist, David Lamendola, gave Hillary $1,000.To contrast, Sanders appeared at a rally for striking Verizon workers in New York City last year, demanding the company meet the workers  demands and admonishing its executives for the company s greedy practices.4. BANK OF AMERICA In 2010, Bank of America got a whopping $1.9 billion refund from the IRS despite making $4.4 billion in profit. And the Institute for Policy Studies reported that Bank of America has over 300 foreign subsidiaries in countries and territories universally known as tax havens, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.In his recent groundbreaking report for The Intercept, Jilani reported that Bank of America paid Hillary Clinton $225,000 in speaking fees after her tenure as Secretary of State.5. CITIGROUP Citigroup was the largest recipient of federal bailout money, getting an astonishing $2.5 trillion after the financial crisis even though they played a major role in the financial meltdown. Citi also paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2010 despite making profits in excess of $4 billion. Had the bank been unable to utilize offshore tax havens, it would have paid $11.5 billion in federal taxes in 2012.According to campaign finance database OpenSecrets.org, Citigroup is Hillary Clinton s top donor, having given over $824,000 in campaign contributions throughout her political career.6. PFIZER The Connecticut-based pharmaceutical giant is notorious for its tax avoidance strategies, paying $0 in federal income tax between 2010 and 2012 and getting a $2.2 billion tax refund despite posting $43 billion in global profits.Pfizer executives gave nearly $40,000 to Clinton s presidential campaign between April and September 2015. And Pfizer itself has given between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to donor records obtained by the Washington Times.7. FEDEX In 2011, FedEx made $2.7 billion in profit, yet they were given a $135 million tax refund from the IRS that same year. FedEx also receives $1 billion a year in corporate welfare from the U.S. Post Office   its chief competitor   to use its aircraft to transport U.S. mail.FedEx has given anywhere between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. The company was also one of four corporations to bundle a $2.5 million donation to Clinton s new diplomacy center (Boeing was another).8. HONEYWELL Despite making over $3 billion in combined profits between 2009 and 2010, Honeywell paid $0 in federal income taxes and got roughly $510 million in refunds. Honeywell CEO David Cote was also one of the loudest voices on the Fix The Debt campaign, calling for the Social Security and Medicare age to be raised to 70.Honeywell, a prominent weapons manufacturer, also gave $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. At the same time, Honeywell and others had their weapons shipped to countries blasted by international watchdogs for their deplorable records on human rights.9. MERCK Merck is one of the nation s largest pharmaceutical companies and biggest tax dodgers   in 2009, Merck pocketed $5.7 billion in profits, yet paid $0 in federal taxes. Merck successfully got out of paying $18.69 billion in federal taxes in 2012 by stashing $53.4 billion of its U.S. profits in overseas tax havens.The Center for Responsive Politics reports that Merck donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation after becoming a member of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2006. It also spent millions on lobbying the U.S. State Department during Hillary Clinton s tenure as Secretary of State.10. CORNING CTJ reports that between 2008 and 2012, Corning made over $3.4 billion in profits and got a $10 million tax refund, paying a 0.1 percent federal tax rate. The Sanders campaign pointed out that Corning CEO Wendell Weeks has called for the retirement age to be raised to 70, while he himself has a $22.8 million retirement account.While Clinton headed up the State Department, Corning lobbied heavily for multiple policies on which it stood to reap financial gains, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton, in turn, lobbied China to lower tariffs on the type of goods manufactured by Corning. The company has also donated between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation and paid the former Secretary of State $225,000 in speaking fees after she announced her presidential campaign.

"HOUSTON (Reuters) - An activist investor in Chevron Corp said on Monday it filed a shareholder resolution that would require the oil producer to report on the feasibility of ending operations in Myanmar, where a crackdown on minority Rohingya Muslims has been decried by the United States as  ethnic cleansing.  The resolution, filed last week by Islamic finance firm Azzad Asset Management, pushes Chevron s board of directors to consider how it could avoid risks  posed by doing business with governments complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity.  Azzad filed a similar resolution at the last Chevron shareholder meeting, garnering support from 6 percent of votes cast. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to southern Bangladesh since the end of August following a campaign by Myanmar security forces in response to attacks by militants in Rakhine State. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations officials have decried the crackdown as a form of genocide.    Myanmar denies committing atrocities against the Rohingya.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, does business in Myanmar through a subsidiary, Unocal Myanmar Offshore Co Ltd. It has projects that include a minority interest in natural gas production and a pipeline, according to the company s website. In a statement to Reuters on Monday, Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said the company  values the ongoing dialogue with the stockholders on this critical issue of violence in Rakhine State, Myanmar.  We will continue to work with other U.S. companies and the government to promote the value of U.S. investment in Myanmar and the need to foster a business environment that respects human rights.  Chevron has the option of accepting the proposal or asking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow it to block it. If Chevron moves to block, Azzad would have the chance to appeal to the SEC. Chevron s annual meeting is slated for next spring.    The filing comes as two Reuters journalists were arrested by Myanmar officials last week. Government officials accuse the pair of violating the country s colonial-era Officials Secrets Act. The arrests have been criticized by several governments as well as journalists  and human rights groups. Chevron declined to directly comment on the arrests. ",1
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge rejected a request for a new trial by two former associates of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who were convicted for their roles in the “Bridgegate” lane closure scandal. The decision late Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton clears the way for the two defendants to be sentenced on March 15. Bridget Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff under the Republican governor, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were convicted in November of orchestrating the shutdown of access lanes at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013. U.S. prosecutors said the resulting gridlock in Fort Lee, New Jersey, was intended to punish the town’s Democratic mayor for declining to back Christie’s re-election campaign. Christie has not been charged in the case and has denied any knowledge of the plan. But Kelly and another conspirator, former Port Authority official David Wildstein, both testified that Christie was aware of the lane closures before they occurred. Wildstein pleaded guilty and appeared at trial as the government’s star witness. In asking for an acquittal or a new trial, Kelly’s lawyers had argued that Wigenton erred when she instructed jurors that they could convict the defendants even if prosecutors failed to prove they had intentionally targeted the mayor for retribution. The motivation for the scheme, Kelly’s lawyers said, was at the core of the government’s case. But Wigenton said motive, while central to the prosecution, is not a required element of the crimes for which Baroni and Kelly were convicted. “The government was under no obligation to introduce evidence of motive, although motive helps present a coherent narrative of events to a jury,” she wrote. Lawyers for Baroni and Kelly did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They can still ask a U.S. appeals court to overturn the verdict after sentencing has taken place. A spokesman for New Jersey’s chief federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, declined to comment on the ruling. The scandal’s fallout helped sink Christie’s once-promising political career. He was passed over for a position in President Donald Trump’s administration after his own presidential bid sputtered, and he has seen record-low approval ratings in New Jersey. ",1
"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Outgoing Dutch Finance Minister and Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem will leave national politics when a new government takes office in approximately two weeks, he wrote in a letter on Wednesday. Dijsselbloem s Labour party was heavily defeated in the March 15 election and will not be part of the new government, agreed this week after months of coalition talks.  I am leaving Dutch politics. It is not easy,  he wrote in a letter published by the party.   I have reached the conclusion that is this position, this stage, I don t have the fire power.

"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar s army said on Wednesday that it had appointed a senior officer to investigate whether any members of the security forces were involved in the killing of 10 people whose bodies have been uncovered in a mass grave in Rakhine State. A violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the western state has caused around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months. The discover of the grave, at the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe, was announced by the military two days ago. In a statement posted on the Facebook page of the military s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army said a five-member investigation team had left the capital Naypyitaw on Wednesday. The team, led by Lieutenant General Aye Win, would  investigate whether the security forces took part or not, in relation to the unidentified dead bodies found in Inn Din village graveyard . It gave no further details and military officials were not immediately available for comment. General Aye Win is the same officer who led a wider probe into the conduct of troops in a conflict that began in late August, which concluded in a report last month that no atrocities took place. Myanmar s armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25. Rights monitors have accused troops of abuses, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. The United States has said it amounted to  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya. The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence. ",1

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A young Singaporean blogger who says he was persecuted for his political opinions in the Southeast Asian country was released on Tuesday from U.S. detention in Chicago after a federal immigration panel ruled in his favor.     The federal Board of Immigration Appeals upheld a March decision by a Chicago immigration judge granting asylum to Amos Yee, 18, who had been jailed twice in Singapore for social media postings critical of government officials, his attorneys said on Tuesday.  Now I can criticize the Singapore government without being sent to prison,  Yee told Reuters after his release.  Yee s trials in Singapore were closely watched by rights groups and the United Nations, and fueled debate in Singapore over censorship, the limits of free speech and political correctness. Yee had been in U.S. immigration detention since December 2016 when he arrived seeking asylum, according to Yee s attorney  Sandra Grossman. The court made its ruling on Sept. 21, but Grossman said she only learned of the outcome this week. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which opposed Yee s asylum application and argued the Singapore government had legitimately prosecuted him, could not be immediately reached.  The department could appeal the ruling to a circuit court but Grossman said she believed it was unlikely. Chicago immigration Judge Samuel Cole found Yee s prosecution, detention and treatment by Singapore authorities  constitute(s) persecution on account of Yee s political opinions.  Officials at Singapore s embassy in Washington could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. In March, the country s Ministry of Home Affairs issued a statement in which it quoted Yee s remarks against Muslims and Christians and noted Yee had pleaded guilty to charges against him. In September last year, Yee pleaded guilty to six charges of deliberately posting comments on the internet - in videos, blog posts and a picture - that were critical of Christianity and Islam. He was sentenced to six weeks in jail. In 2015, Yee was convicted on charges of harassment and insulting a religious group over comments he made about former premier Lee Kuan Yew and Christians soon after Lee s death. His sentence at the time amounted to four weeks in jail. The case now goes back to a Chicago immigration court to complete any security investigations or exams as part of the asylum process. ",1
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton had a four-percentage point advantage in support over Republican Donald Trump ahead of their first U.S. presidential debate, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Friday. The Sept. 16-22 opinion poll showed that 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 37 percent supported Trump. Clinton has mostly led Trump in the poll during the 2016 campaign, though her advantage has narrowed since the end of the Democratic and Republican national conventions in July. With just six weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Monday’s debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York will be the first of three between the White House rivals. It presents a major opportunity for them to appeal to voters who have yet to commit to a candidate after a mostly negative race in which Clinton and Trump have sought to brand each other as untrustworthy and dangerous for the country. The live, televised matchup is expected to draw a Super Bowl-sized television audience of 100 million Americans, according to some commentators. Among those watching will be people who so far remain on the fence. This could be a sizable group: Some 22 percent of likely voters said in the latest poll that they do not support either major-party candidate. That was more than twice the proportion of uncommitted voters at the same point in the 2012 election between Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney. These uncommitted voters appear to be leaning more toward Trump than Clinton, according to the latest poll, though they have not been convinced enough to say they will vote for him in November. It was also possible that some of these voters would pick an alternative-party candidate like Libertarian Gary Johnson or the Green Party’s Jill Stein. Clinton led a separate four-way poll that included Trump, Johnson and Stein. Among likely voters, 39 percent supported Clinton, 37 percent favored Trump, 7 percent picked Johnson and 2 percent supported Stein. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. It included 1,559 respondents who were considered to be likely voters given their voting history, registration status and stated intention to show up on Election Day. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way. National polls have produced varying measurements of support for Clinton and Trump during the 2016 campaign. The differences are partly due to the fact that some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls.  Polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that Clinton’s lead over Trump has been shrinking this month. The most recent individual polls put her advantage at 3 percentage points. ",1
"For anyone who believes they re more CONSERVATIVE than the average Trump supporter because they re planning to vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and his running mate, former Governor Bill Weld you may want to re-think your  conservative  position. It turns out, you re really just voting for another Barack Obama without the race card to fall back on or Hillary without the criminal background Libertarians should be allergic to power grabs by the executive for the obvious reason that they lend themselves to concentrated authority and (usually) bigger government. If you want to slow the state down, a robust, sharply divided Congress that jealously guards its constitutional prerogatives from the president should be your ideal   even in cases where the executive happens to be acting towards an end you deem salutary. In this year of all years, admirers of Obama s various forms of overreach should be thinking hard about how President Trump might build on his precedents. To a constitutionalist, which most mainstream libertarians claim to be, all of this is second nature.Is Gary Johnson a constitutionalist?THRUSH: How about Obama s executive order, which was decried as being a great constitutional violation by the Republicans, Obama s executive order on immigration. Did you consider that to be a violation or did you consider that a reasonable use of targeted executive power?MR. JOHNSON: I saw it as a reasonable use, challenging Congress to action. And an untold story with regard to Obama and immigration is he s broken up 3 million families. He has deported 3 million heads of households that have gone back to Mexico and their families have remained in the United States.If Obama issued an executive order to the IRS demanding that they collect 10 percent more in tax from individuals than the Internal Revenue Code provides, would Johnson deem that legal? What if the order instructed the agency to collect 10 percent less tax? Would his opinion of its legality change? Because it shouldn t. Bear in mind, Obama s 2014  DAPA  amnesty has already been blocked by a preliminary injunction that was upheld on review by the Fifth Circuit so Johnson had plenty of legal cover here to say that he s troubled by Obama s procedural approach despite the fact that he happens to agree with the policy ends. Instead he seems to endorse the bizarre legal theory pushed by some leftists that if Congress isn t moving quickly enough for the president s taste in enacting a policy he supports, he can go ahead and  challenge  them by enacting it himself and leaving it to Congress to overrule him if they feel strongly to the contrary. How the hell does a libertarian arrive at that model of government? The president does what he wants, and then it falls to the people s representatives to try to muster a two-thirds majority to override his policy? What?

"After the bombshell news that Trump gave highly classified information to Russian, the White House is scrambling to defend his conduct, no matter how reckless. National security adviser H.R. McMaster argued to the press on Tuesday that the President didn t jeopardize U.S. intelligence by giving out highly sensitive intel to Russian Officials, and added that Trump had no idea where the intel came from.McMaster stated  The President in no way undermined sourced or methods in the course of this conversation,  saying that anyone could get their hands on this information in  open-source reporting. The real kicker is that McMaster argued that it was impossible for Trump to have endangered national security due to the fact that he did not even know what he was discussing.  The President wasn t even aware of where this information came from,  he said.  He wasn t briefed on the source. There was no denying that Trump discussed top secret information to Moscow s U.S. ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov. But McMaster attacked those who leaked the contents of the conversation to the media, insisting that is the story that people should be paying attention to. I think the real issue and what I would like to see debated more is that our national security has been put at risk by those violating confidentiality,  he said,  I think national security is put at risk by this leak and leaks like this. McMaster noted that the administration would be investigating the source of leaks to reporters, but did not respond to the question of who would be conducting the investigation.Reports on Monday from the Washington Post said the discussion was about Islamic State information, which came from a U.S. ally with the stipulation that it would not be shared with other governments.Officials from the Democratic and Republican party are both outraged by this revelation and its potential to put intelligence sources and partners at risk.See McMaster s full statement here:Feature image via video screengrab",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Congressman Jason Chaffetz said on Thursday he plans to withdraw a bill that would have sold off more than 3 million acres of federal land to private interests after it drew a barrage of negative comments from hunters and outdoor enthusiasts. Chaffetz said in a post on the Instagram social media site that he would scrap the so-called Disposal of Excess Federal Lands Act of 2017, which he introduced last week, saying he feared it sent “the wrong message.” “I’m a proud gun owner, hunter and love our public lands,” the Utah representative said in a comment, beneath a photo he posted of himself outdoors wearing hunting gear and holding a dog. “I hear you and HR 621 dies tomorrow,” added Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. HR 621 is the abbreviated name of the bill, which would have directed the Interior Department to sell off 3.3 million acres of federal land including “to non-federal entities” across 10 western states, which Chaffetz had said were “small parcels of land” that former President Bill Clinton previously identified as “serving no public purpose.” Sportsmen and women, hunting groups, and outdoor gear retailers had flooded Chaffetz’s Instagram account with thousands of posts, urging him to “say no to HR 621” and to  “#keepitpublic.”. Conservation and hunting and gaming advocacy groups have been raising concerns over the past month about what they see an aggressive strategy by Congress to make it easier to transfer public lands to state control or sell it off. Last month, on the first day of the new Congress, the House passed a rules package that contained a measure that would facilitate a public lands sell-off by directing the Congressional Budget Office, which provides lawmakers data for budget decisions, to assign no monetary value to the lands. Outdoors groups say public lands hold value for the outdoor recreation economy. The Wilderness Society values that industry at over $646 billion.    “I don’t think anybody had expected the backlash that has happened as a result of these bills. People are upset out here in the west and it is one of the hottest political issues in western states,” said Brad Brooks, Idaho Deputy Regional Director for the Wilderness Society. President Donald Trump has advocated for opening up public land for more drilling and mining, although he has said that public land should stay under federal control. ",1
"MANILA (Reuters) - The United States will transfer an observation blimp to the Philippines to help it track maritime activity and guard its borders amid rising tensions in the South China Sea, a U.S. diplomat said on Monday. Philip Goldberg, U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, said Washington would give Manila, its oldest Asia-Pacific security ally, $42 million worth of sensors, radar and communications equipment. “We will add to its capability to put sensors on ships and put an aerostat blimp in the air to see into the maritime space,” Goldberg said in an interview with CNN Philippines,  The blimp is a balloon-borne radar to collect information and detect movements in the South China Sea, a Philippine military official said.  China claims almost the entire South China Sea, believed to have huge deposits of oil and gas. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the waters, through which about $5 trillion in trade is shipped every year. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter visited the Philippines last week to reaffirm Washington’s “ironclad” commitment to defend Manila under a 1951 security treaty. China has been expanding its presence on its seven artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago and on Monday landed a military plane for the first time on one of them, Fiery Cross Reef. It comes ahead of a planned U.S. freedom of navigation patrol this month near the Spratlys. Carter’s visit also signals the start of U.S. military deployment in the Philippines, with 75 soldiers to be rotated in and out of an air base north of Manila. Goldberg said the two allies had agreed to set up a system for “secure and classified communications” as part of a five-year, $425 million security initiative by Washington in Southeast Asia.  Manila will receive some $120 million in U.S. military aid this year, the largest sum since 2000 when the American military returned to the Philippines for training and exercises after an eight-year hiatus.  They signed a new deal in 2013 allowing increased U.S. military presence on a rotational basis and storage of supplies and equipment for maritime security and humanitarian missions.  ",1
"GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar authorities have agreed to allow the United Nations to resume distribution of food in northern Rakhine state which was suspended for two months, the World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday. The agreement, whose details are still being worked out, came as UNICEF reported that Rohingya refugee children fleeing into Bangladesh were arriving  close to death  from malnutrition. The WFP was previously distributing food rations to 110,000 people in northern Rakhine state - to both Buddhist and the minority Muslim Rohingya communities. Rohingya insurgent attacks on police stations triggered an army crackdown, that the United Nations has called  ethnic cleansing , and U.N. humanitarian agencies have not been able to access northern Rakhine to deliver aid since then. WFP deliveries have continued to 140,000 people in central Rakhine.  WFP has been given the green light to resume food assistance operations in northern part of Rakhine. We are working with the government to coordinate the details,  WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told journalists in Geneva. She had no timeline or details on the proposed distribution of rations to northern Rakhine, and said it was still being discussed with the authorities in Myanmar.  We just have to see what the situation on the ground is. It s very hard to say these things if you can t get in,  Luescher said. Some 604,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh in the past two months, bringing the total to 817,000, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. Malnutrition rates in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships in Rakhine, where the vast majority of the Rohingya refugees originate, were already above emergency threshold rates before the crisis, the U.N. Children s Fund (UNICEF) said.  Since August 25, we have had to stop treating 4,000 children with severe acute malnutrition in northern Rakhine because we have had no access,  UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado told the briefing. UNICEF has screened nearly 60,000 Rohingya refugee children arriving in Bangladesh, nearly 2,000 of whom have been identified as having severe acute malnutrition, with another 7,000 moderately acutely malnourished, she said. The agency screened 340 children among recent arrivals, a  rough and rapid exercise  that found 10 percent to be severely acutely malnourished, she said.   This is an extremely small number of children so these numbers are not representative,  Mercado said.  But what they do tell us is that some of the children are close to death by the time they make it across the border.  ",1
